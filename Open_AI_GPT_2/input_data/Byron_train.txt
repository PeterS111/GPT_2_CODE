
ON LEAVING NEWSTEAD ABBEY. 

    Why dost thou build the hall, Son of the winged days? Thou lookest
    from thy tower to-day: yet a few years, and the blast of the desart
    comes: it howls in thy empty court.-OSSIAN. 

I.

  Through thy battlements, Newstead,  the hollow winds whistle: 
    Thou, the hall of my Fathers, art gone to decay;
  In thy once smiling garden, the hemlock and thistle
    Have choak'd up the rose, which late bloom'd in the way.

2.

  Of the mail-cover'd Barons, who, proudly, to battle, 
    Led their vassals from Europe to Palestine's plain, 
  The escutcheon and shield, which with ev'ry blast rattle,
    Are the only sad vestiges now that remain.

3.

  No more doth old Robert, with harp-stringing numbers,
    Raise a flame, in the breast, for the war-laurell'd wreath;
  Near Askalon's towers, John of Horistan  slumbers,
    Unnerv'd is the hand of his minstrel, by death.

4.

  Paul and Hubert too sleep in the valley of Cressy;
    For the safety of Edward and England they fell:
  My Fathers! the tears of your country redress ye:
    How you fought! how you died! still her annals can tell.

5.

  On Marston,  with Rupert,  'gainst traitors contending,
    Four brothers enrich'd, with their blood, the bleak field;
  For the rights of a monarch their country defending, 
    Till death their attachment to royalty seal'd. 

6.

  Shades of heroes, farewell! your descendant departing
    From the seat of his ancestors, bids you adieu! 
  Abroad, or at home, your remembrance imparting
    New courage, he'll think upon glory and you.

7.

  Though a tear dim his eye at this sad separation, 
    'Tis nature, not fear, that excites his regret; 
  Far distant he goes, with the same emulation,
    The fame of his Fathers he ne'er can forget. 

8.

  That fame, and that memory, still will he cherish; 
    He vows that he ne'er will disgrace your renown:
  Like you will he live, or like you will he perish;
    When decay'd, may he mingle his dust with your own!

TO E---

  Let Folly smile, to view the names
    Of thee and me, in Friendship twin'd;
  Yet Virtue will have greater claims
    To love, than rank with vice combin'd.

  And though unequal is thy fate,
    Since title deck'd my higher birth;
  Yet envy not this gaudy state,
    Thine is the pride of modest worth.

  Our souls at least congenial meet,
    Nor can thy lot my rank disgrace;
  Our intercourse is not less sweet,
    Since worth of rank supplies the place.

ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG LADY, 
  COUSIN TO THE AUTHOR, AND VERY DEAR TO HIM.

1.

  Hush'd are the winds, and still the evening gloom,
    Not e'en a zephyr wanders through the grove,
  Whilst I return to view my Margaret's tomb,
    And scatter flowers on the dust I love.

2.

  Within this narrow cell reclines her clay,
    That clay, where once such animation beam'd;
  The King of Terrors seiz'd her as his prey;
    Not worth, nor beauty, have her life redeem'd.

3.

  Oh! could that King of Terrors pity feel,
    Or Heaven reverse the dread decree of fate,
  Not here the mourner would his grief reveal,
    Not here the Muse her virtues would relate.

4.

  But wherefore weep? Her matchless spirit soars
    Beyond where splendid shines the orb of day;
  And weeping angels lead her to those bowers,
    Where endless pleasures virtuous deeds repay.

5.

  And shall presumptuous mortals Heaven arraign!
    And, madly, Godlike Providence accuse!
  Ah! no, far fly from me attempts so vain;--
    I'll ne'er submission to my God refuse.

6.

  Yet is remembrance of those virtues dear,
    Yet fresh the memory of that beauteous face;
  Still they call forth my warm affection's tear,
    Still in my heart retain their wonted place. 

TO D---

1.

  In thee, I fondly hop'd to clasp
    A friend, whom death alone could sever;
  Till envy, with malignant grasp, 
    Detach'd thee from my breast for ever.

2.

  True, she has forc'd thee from my breast,
    Yet, in my heart, thou keep'st thy seat; 
  There, there, thine image still must rest,
    Until that heart shall cease to beat.

3.

  And, when the grave restores her dead,
    When life again to dust is given,
  On thy dear breast I'll lay my head--
    Without thee! where would be my Heaven?

TO CAROLINE. 

1.

  Think'st thou I saw thy beauteous eyes,
    Suffus'd in tears, implore to stay;
  And heard unmov'd thy plenteous sighs,
    Which said far more than words can say? 

2.

  Though keen the grief thy tears exprest, 
    When love and hope lay both o'erthrown;
  Yet still, my girl, this bleeding breast
    Throbb'd, with deep sorrow, as thine own.

3.

  But, when our cheeks with anguish glow'd,
    When thy sweet lips were join'd to mine;
  The tears that from my eyelids flow'd
    Were lost in those which fell from thine.

4.

  Thou could'st not feel my burning cheek,
    Thy gushing tears had quench'd its flame,
  And, as thy tongue essay'd to speak,
    In sighs alone it breath'd my name.

5.

  And yet, my girl, we weep in vain,
    In vain our fate in sighs deplore;
  Remembrance only can remain,
    But that, will make us weep the more.

6.

  Again, thou best belov'd, adieu!
    Ah! if thou canst, o'ercome regret,
  Nor let thy mind past joys review,
    Our only hope is, to forget!

TO CAROLINE. 

1.

  You say you love, and yet your eye
    No symptom of that love conveys,
  You say you love, yet know not why,
    Your cheek no sign of love betrays.

2.

  Ah! did that breast with ardour glow,
  With me alone it joy could know,
  Or feel with me the listless woe,
    Which racks my heart when far from thee.

3.

  Whene'er we meet my blushes rise,
    And mantle through my purpled cheek,
  But yet no blush to mine replies,
    Nor e'en your eyes your love bespeak.

4.

  Your voice alone declares your flame,
  And though so sweet it breathes my name,
  Our passions still are not the same;
    Alas! you cannot love like me.

5.

  For e'en your lip seems steep'd in snow,
    And though so oft it meets my kiss,
  It burns with no responsive glow,
    Nor melts like mine in dewy bliss.

6.

  Ah! what are words to love like mine,
  Though uttered by a voice like thine,
  I still in murmurs must repine,
    And think that love can ne'er be true,

7.

  Which meets me with no joyous sign,
    Without a sigh which bids adieu;
  How different is my love from thine,
    How keen my grief when leaving you.

8.

  Your image fills my anxious breast,
  Till day declines adown the West,
  And when at night, I sink to rest,
      In dreams your fancied form I view.

9.

  'Tis then your breast, no longer cold,
    With equal ardour seems to burn,
  While close your arms around me fold,
    Your lips my kiss with warmth return.

10.

  Ah! would these joyous moments last;
  Vain HOPE! the gay delusion's past,
  That voice!--ah! no, 'tis but the blast,
    Which echoes through the neighbouring grove.

11.

  But when awake, your lips I seek,
    And clasp enraptur'd all your charms,
  So chill's the pressure of your cheek,
    I fold a statue in my arms.

12.

  If thus, when to my heart embrac'd,
  No pleasure in your eyes is trac'd,
  You may be prudent, fair, and chaste,
    But ah! my girl, you do not love.

TO EMMA. 

  1.

  Since now the hour is come at last,
    When you must quit your anxious lover;
  Since now, our dream of bliss is past,
    One pang, my girl, and all is over.

  2.

  Alas! that pang will be severe,
    Which bids us part to meet no more;
  Which tears me far from one so dear,
    Departing for a distant shore.

  3.

  Well! we have pass'd some happy hours,
    And joy will mingle with our tears;
  When thinking on these ancient towers,
    The shelter of our infant years;

  4.

  Where from this Gothic casement's height,
    We view'd the lake, the park, the dell,
  And still, though tears obstruct our sight,
    We lingering look a last farewell,

  5.

  O'er fields through which we us'd to run,
    And spend the hours in childish play;
  O'er shades where, when our race was done,
    Reposing on my breast you lay;

  6.

  Whilst I, admiring, too remiss,
    Forgot to scare the hovering flies,
  Yet envied every fly the kiss,
    It dar'd to give your slumbering eyes:

  7.

  See still the little painted bark,
    In which I row'd you o'er the lake;
  See there, high waving o'er the park,
    The elm I clamber'd for your sake.

  8.

  These times are past, our joys are gone,
    You leave me, leave this happy vale;
  These scenes, I must retrace alone;
    Without thee, what will they avail?

  9.

  Who can conceive, who has not prov'd,
    The anguish of a last embrace?
  When, torn from all you fondly lov'd,
    You bid a long adieu to peace.

  10.

  This is the deepest of our woes,
    For this these tears our cheeks bedew;
  This is of love the final close,
    Oh, God! the fondest, last adieu!

FRAGMENTS OF SCHOOL EXERCISES:
  FROM THE "PROMETHEUS VINCTUS" OF AESCHYLUS,

    Great Jove! to whose Almighty Throne
        Both Gods and mortals homage pay,
      Ne'er may my soul thy power disown,
        Thy dread behests ne'er disobey.
      Oft shall the sacred victim fall,
      In sea-girt Ocean's mossy hall;
      My voice shall raise no impious strain,
  'Gainst him who rules the sky and azure main.

      How different now thy joyless fate,
        Since first Hesione thy bride,
      When plac'd aloft in godlike state,
        The blushing beauty by thy side,
      Thou sat'st, while reverend Ocean smil'd,
      And mirthful strains the hours beguil'd;
      The Nymphs and Tritons danc'd around,
  Nor yet thy doom was fix'd, nor Jove relentless frown'd,

WRITTEN IN "LETTERS OF AN ITALIAN NUN AND AN  ENGLISH GENTLEMAN,
BY J. J. ROUSSEAU;   FOUNDED ON FACTS."

    "Away, away,--your flattering arts
    May now betray some simpler hearts;
    And you will smile at their believing,
    And they shall weep at your deceiving."

ANSWER TO THE FOREGOING,  ADDRESSED TO MISS----.

  Dear simple girl, those flattering arts,
  (From which thou'dst guard frail female hearts,)
  Exist but in imagination,
  Mere phantoms of thine own creation; 
  For he who views that witching grace,
  That perfect form, that lovely face,
  With eyes admiring, oh! believe me,
  He never wishes to deceive thee:
  Once in thy polish'd mirror glance 
  Thou'lt there descry that elegance
  Which from our sex demands such praises,
  But envy in the other raises.--
  Then he who tells thee of thy beauty, 
  Believe me, only does his duty:
  Ah! fly not from the candid youth;
  It is not flattery,--'tis truth. 

ON A CHANGE OF MASTERS AT A GREAT PUBLIC SCHOOL. 

  Where are those honours, IDA! once your own,
  When Probus fill'd your magisterial throne?
  As ancient Rome, fast falling to disgrace,
  Hail'd a Barbarian in her Caesar's place,
  So you, degenerate, share as hard a fate,
  And seat Pomposus where your Probus sate.
  Of narrow brain, yet of a narrower soul, 
  Pomposus holds you in his harsh controul;
  Pomposus, by no social virtue sway'd,
  With florid jargon, and with vain parade;
  With noisy nonsense, and new-fangled rules,
  (Such as were ne'er before enforc'd in schools.) 
  Mistaking pedantry for learning's laws,
  He governs, sanction'd but by self-applause;
  With him the same dire fate, attending Rome,
  Ill-fated Ida! soon must stamp your doom:
  Like her o'erthrown, for ever lost to fame,
  No trace of science left you, but the name,

EPITAPH ON A BELOVED FRIEND.

  Oh, Friend! for ever lov'd, for ever dear! 
  What fruitless tears have bathed thy honour'd bier!
  What sighs re-echo'd to thy parting breath,
  Whilst thou wast struggling in the pangs of death!
  Could tears retard the tyrant in his course;
  Could sighs avert his dart's relentless force;
  Could youth and virtue claim a short delay,
  Or beauty charm the spectre from his prey;
  Thou still hadst liv'd to bless my aching sight,
  Thy comrade's honour and thy friend's delight.
  If yet thy gentle spirit hover nigh
  The spot where now thy mouldering ashes lie,
  Here wilt thou read, recorded on my heart,
  A grief too deep to trust the sculptor's art.
  No marble marks thy couch of lowly sleep,
  But living statues there are seen to weep;
  Affliction's semblance bends not o'er thy tomb,
  Affliction's self deplores thy youthful doom.
  What though thy sire lament his failing line,
  A father's sorrows cannot equal mine!
  Though none, like thee, his dying hour will cheer,
  Yet other offspring soothe his anguish here:
  But, who with me shall hold thy former place?
  Thine image, what new friendship can efface?
  Ah, none!--a father's tears will cease to flow,
  Time will assuage an infant brother's woe;
  To all, save one, is consolation known,
  While solitary Friendship sighs alone.

ADRIAN'S ADDRESS TO HIS SOUL WHEN DYING.

  Animula! vagula, Blandula,
  Hospes, comesque corporis,
  Quae nunc abibis in Loca--
  Pallidula, rigida, nudula,
  Nec, ut soles, dabis Jocos?

TRANSLATION.

  Ah! gentle, fleeting, wav'ring Sprite,
  Friend and associate of this clay!
    To what unknown region borne,
  Wilt thou, now, wing thy distant flight?
  No more with wonted humour gay,
    But pallid, cheerless, and forlorn.

A FRAGMENT. 

  When, to their airy hall, my Fathers' voice
  Shall call my spirit, joyful in their choice;
  When, pois'd upon the gale, my form shall ride,
  Or, dark in mist, descend the mountain's side;
  Oh! may my shade behold no sculptur'd urns,
  To mark the spot where earth to earth returns!
  No lengthen'd scroll, no praise-encumber'd stone; 
  My epitaph shall be my name alone: 
  If that with honour fail to crown my clay, 
  Oh! may no other fame my deeds repay!
  That, only that, shall single out the spot;
  By that remember'd, or with that forgot. 

TO CAROLINE. 

1.

  Oh! when shall the grave hide for ever my sorrow?
  Oh! when shall my soul wing her flight from this clay?
  The present is hell! and the coming to-morrow
    But brings, with new torture, the curse of to-day.

2.

  From my eye flows no tear, from my lips flow no curses, 
    I blast not the fiends who have hurl'd me from bliss;
  For poor is the soul which, bewailing, rehearses
    Its querulous grief, when in anguish like this--

3.

  Was my eye, 'stead of tears, with red fury flakes bright'ning,
    Would my lips breathe a flame which no stream could assuage,
  On our foes should my glance launch in vengeance its lightning,
    With transport my tongue give a loose to its rage.

4.

  But now tears and curses, alike unavailing,
    Would add to the souls of our tyrants delight;
  Could they view us our sad separation bewailing,
    Their merciless hearts would rejoice at the sight.

5.

  Yet, still, though we bend with a feign'd resignation,
    Life beams not for us with one ray that can cheer;
  Love and Hope upon earth bring no more consolation,
    In the grave is our hope, for in life is our fear.

6.

  Oh! when, my ador'd, in the tomb will they place me,
    Since, in life, love and friendship for ever are fled?
  If again in the mansion of death I embrace thee,
    Perhaps they will leave unmolested--the dead.

TO CAROLINE. 

1.

  When I hear you express an affection so warm,
    Ne'er think, my belov'd, that I do not believe;
  For your lip would the soul of suspicion disarm,
    And your eye beams a ray which can never deceive.

2.

  Yet still, this fond bosom regrets, while adoring,
    That love, like the leaf, must fall into the sear,
  That Age will come on, when Remembrance, deploring,
  Contemplates the scenes of her youth, with a tear;

3.

  That the time must arrive, when, no longer retaining
    Their auburn, those locks must wave thin to the breeze,
  When a few silver hairs of those tresses remaining,
    Prove nature a prey to decay and disease.

4.

  Tis this, my belov'd, which spreads gloom o'er my features,
    Though I ne'er shall presume to arraign the decree
  Which God has proclaim'd as the fate of his creatures,
    In the death which one day will deprive you of me. 

5.

  Mistake not, sweet sceptic, the cause of emotion, 
    No doubt can the mind of your lover invade;
  He worships each look with such faithful devotion,
    A smile can enchant, or a tear can dissuade.

6.

  But as death, my belov'd, soon or late shall o'ertake us,
    And our breasts, which alive with such sympathy glow,
  Will sleep in the grave, till the blast shall awake us,
    When calling the dead, in Earth's bosom laid low.

7.

  Oh! then let us drain, while we may, draughts of pleasure,
    Which from passion, like ours, must unceasingly flow; 
  Let us pass round the cup of Love's bliss in full measure,
    And quaff the contents as our nectar below.

ON A DISTANT VIEW OF THE VILLAGE AND SCHOOL OF HARROW ON THE HILL, 1806.

      Oh! mihi praeteritos referat si Jupiter annos.

      VIRGIL.

1.

  Ye scenes of my childhood, whose lov'd recollection
    Embitters the present, compar'd with the past;
  Where science first dawn'd on the powers of reflection,
    And friendships were form'd, too romantic to last; 

2.

  Where fancy, yet, joys to retrace the resemblance
    Of comrades, in friendship and mischief allied; 
  How welcome to me your ne'er fading remembrance, 
    Which rests in the bosom, though hope is deny'd!

3.

  Again I revisit the hills where we sported,
    The streams where we swam, and the fields where we fought; 
  The school where, loud warn'd by the bell, we resorted,
    To pore o'er the precepts by Pedagogues taught.

4.

  Again I behold where for hours I have ponder'd,
    As reclining, at eve, on yon tombstone  I lay;
  Or round the steep brow of the churchyard I wander'd,
    To catch the last gleam of the sun's setting ray.

5.

  I once more view the room, with spectators surrounded,
    Where, as Zanga,  I trod on Alonzo o'erthrown;
  While, to swell my young pride, such applauses resounded,
    I fancied that Mossop  himself was outshone.

6.

  Or, as Lear, I pour'd forth the deep imprecation,
    By my daughters, of kingdom and reason depriv'd;
  Till, fir'd by loud plaudits and self-adulation,
    I regarded myself as a Garrick reviv'd. 

7.

  Ye dreams of my boyhood, how much I regret you!
    Unfaded your memory dwells in my breast; 
  Though sad and deserted, I ne'er can forget you:
    Your pleasures may still be in fancy possest.

8.

  To Ida full oft may remembrance restore me, 
    While Fate shall the shades of the future unroll!
  Since Darkness o'ershadows the prospect before me,
    More dear is the beam of the past to my soul!

9.

  But if, through the course of the years which await me,
    Some new scene of pleasure should open to view,
  I will say, while with rapture the thought shall elate me,
    "Oh! such were the days which my infancy knew." 

THOUGHTS SUGGESTED BY A COLLEGE EXAMINATION.

  High in the midst, surrounded by his peers,
  Magnus  his ample front sublime uprears: 
  Plac'd on his chair of state, he seems a God,
  While Sophs  and Freshmen tremble at his nod;
  As all around sit wrapt in speechless gloom, 
  His voice, in thunder, shakes the sounding dome;
  Denouncing dire reproach to luckless fools,
  Unskill'd to plod in mathematic rules.

   Happy the youth! in Euclid's axioms tried,
  Though little vers'd in any art beside;
  Who, scarcely skill'd an English line to pen, 
  Scans Attic metres with a critic's ken.

  What! though he knows not how his fathers bled,
  When civil discord pil'd the fields with dead,
  When Edward bade his conquering bands advance,
  Or Henry trampled on the crest of France:
  Though marvelling at the name of Magna Charta,
  Yet well he recollects the laws of Sparta;
  Can tell, what edicts sage Lycurgus made,
  While Blackstone's on the shelf, neglected laid;
  Of Grecian dramas vaunts the deathless fame,
  Of Avon's bard, rememb'ring scarce the name.

  Such is the youth whose scientific pate
  Class-honours, medals, fellowships, await;
  Or even, perhaps, the declamation prize,
  If to such glorious height, he lifts his eyes.
  But lo! no common orator can hope
  The envied silver cup within his scope:
  Not that our heads much eloquence require,
  Th' ATHENIAN'S  glowing style, or TULLY'S fire.
  A manner clear or warm is useless, since 
  We do not try by speaking to convince;
  Be other orators of pleasing proud,--
  We speak to please ourselves, not move the crowd:
  Our gravity prefers the muttering tone,
  A proper mixture of the squeak and groan:
  No borrow'd grace of action must be seen,
  The slightest motion would displease the Dean;
  Whilst every staring Graduate would prate,
  Against what--he could never imitate.

  The man, who hopes t' obtain the promis'd cup,
  Must in one posture stand, and ne'er look up;
  Nor stop, but rattle over every word--
  No matter what, so it can not be heard:
  Thus let him hurry on, nor think to rest:
  Who speaks the fastest's sure to speak the best;
  Who utters most within the shortest space,
  May, safely, hope to win the wordy race.

  The Sons of Science these, who, thus repaid,
  Linger in ease in Granta's sluggish shade;
  Where on Cam's sedgy banks, supine, they lie,
  Unknown, unhonour'd live--unwept for die:
  Dull as the pictures, which adorn their halls,
  They think all learning fix'd within their walls:
  In manners rude, in foolish forms precise,
  All modern arts affecting to despise;
  Yet prizing Bentley's, Brunck's, or Porson's  note, 
  More than the verse on which the critic wrote:
  Vain as their honours, heavy as their Ale, 
  Sad as their wit, and tedious as their tale;
  To friendship dead, though not untaught to feel,
  When Self and Church demand a Bigot zeal.
  With eager haste they court the lord of power, 
  (Whether 'tis PITT or PETTY  rules the hour;)
  To him, with suppliant smiles, they bend the head,
  While distant mitres to their eyes are spread; 
  But should a storm o'erwhelm him with disgrace,
  They'd fly to seek the next, who fill'd his place.
  Such are the men who learning's treasures guard!
  Such is their practice, such is their reward!
  This much, at least, we may presume to say--
  The premium can't exceed the price they pay. 

 TO MARY,

ON RECEIVING HER PICTURE. 

1.

  This faint resemblance of thy charms,
    (Though strong as mortal art could give,)
  My constant heart of fear disarms,
    Revives my hopes, and bids me live.

2.

  Here, I can trace the locks of gold
    Which round thy snowy forehead wave;
  The cheeks which sprung from Beauty's mould,
    The lips, which made me 'Beauty's' slave.

3.

  Here I can trace--ah, no! that eye,
    Whose azure floats in liquid fire,
  Must all the painter's art defy,
    And bid him from the task retire.

4.

  Here, I behold its beauteous hue;
  But where's the beam so sweetly straying, 
  Which gave a lustre to its blue,
    Like Luna o'er the ocean playing?

5.

  Sweet copy! far more dear to me,
    Lifeless, unfeeling as thou art,
  Than all the living forms could be,
    Save her who plac'd thee next my heart.

6.

  She plac'd it, sad, with needless fear,
    Lest time might shake my wavering soul,
  Unconscious that her image there
    Held every sense in fast controul.

7.

  Thro' hours, thro' years, thro' time,'twill cheer--
    My hope, in gloomy moments, raise;
  In life's last conflict 'twill appear,
    And meet my fond, expiring gaze.

ON THE DEATH OF MR. FOX,

THE FOLLOWING ILLIBERAL IMPROMPTU APPEARED IN THE "MORNING POST."

  "Our Nation's foes lament on Fox's death,
  But bless the hour, when PITT resign'd his breath:
  These feelings wide, let Sense and Truth unclue,
  We give the palm, where Justice points its due."

TO WHICH THE AUTHOR OF THESE PIECES SENT THE FOLLOWING REPLY 
FOR INSERTION IN THE "MORNING CHRONICLE."

  Oh, factious viper! whose envenom'd tooth
  Would mangle, still, the dead, perverting truth; 
  What, though our "nation's foes" lament the fate,
  With generous feeling, of the good and great;
  Shall dastard tongues essay to blast the name 
  Of him, whose meed exists in endless fame?
  When PITT expir'd in plenitude of power,
  Though ill success obscur'd his dying hour,
  Pity her dewy wings before him spread,
  For noble spirits "war not with the dead:"
  His friends in tears, a last sad requiem gave,
  As all his errors slumber'd in the grave; 
  He sunk, an Atlas bending "'neath the weight" 
  Of cares o'erwhelming our conflicting state.
  When, lo! a Hercules, in Fox, appear'd,
  Who for a time the ruin'd fabric rear'd:
  He, too, is fall'n, who Britain's loss supplied, 
  With him, our fast reviving hopes have died;
  Not one great people, only, raise his urn,
  All Europe's far-extended regions mourn.
  "These feelings wide, let Sense and Truth undue,
  To give the palm where Justice points its due;" 
  Yet, let not canker'd Calumny assail, 
  Or round her statesman wind her gloomy veil.
  FOX! o'er whose corse a mourning world must weep,
  Whose dear remains in honour'd marble sleep;
  For whom, at last, e'en hostile nations groan,
  While friends and foes, alike, his talents own.--
  Fox! shall, in Britain's future annals, shine,
  Nor e'en to PITT, the patriot's 'palm' resign;
  Which Envy, wearing Candour's sacred mask,
  For PITT, and PITT alone, has dar'd to ask. 

TO A LADY WHO PRESENTED TO THE AUTHOR A LOCK OF HAIR BRAIDED WITH HIS
OWN, AND APPOINTED A NIGHT IN DECEMBER TO MEET HIM IN THE GARDEN. 

  These locks, which fondly thus entwine,
  In firmer chains our hearts confine,
  Than all th' unmeaning protestations
  Which swell with nonsense, love orations.
  Our love is fix'd, I think we've prov'd it;
  Nor time, nor place, nor art have mov'd it;
  Then wherefore should we sigh and whine,
  With groundless jealousy repine;
  With silly whims, and fancies frantic,
  Merely to make our love romantic?
  Why should you weep, like Lydia Languish,
  And fret with self-created anguish?
  Or doom the lover you have chosen,
  On winter nights to sigh half frozen;
  In leafless shades, to sue for pardon,
  Only because the scene's a garden?
  For gardens seem, by one consent,
  (Since Shakespeare set the precedent;
  Since Juliet first declar'd her passion)
  To form the place of assignation.
  Oh! would some modern muse inspire,
  And seat her by a sea-coal fire;
  Or had the bard at Christmas written,
  And laid the scene of love in Britain;
  He surely, in commiseration,
  Had chang'd the place of declaration.
  In Italy, I've no objection,
  Warm nights are proper for reflection;
  But here our climate is so rigid,
  That love itself, is rather frigid:
  Think on our chilly situation,
  And curb this rage for imitation.
  Then let us meet, as oft we've done,
  Beneath the influence of the sun;
  Or, if at midnight I must meet you,
  Within your mansion let me greet you: 
  'There', we can love for hours together,
  Much better, in such snowy weather,
  Than plac'd in all th' Arcadian groves,
  That ever witness'd rural loves;
  'Then', if my passion fail to please, 
  Next night I'll be content to freeze;
  No more I'll give a loose to laughter,
  But curse my fate, for ever after. 

TO A BEAUTIFUL QUAKER. 

  Sweet girl! though only once we met,
  That meeting I shall ne'er forget;
  And though we ne'er may meet again,
  Remembrance will thy form retain;
  I would not say, "I love," but still,
  My senses struggle with my will:
  In vain to drive thee from my breast,
  My thoughts are more and more represt;
  In vain I check the rising sighs,
  Another to the last replies:
  Perhaps, this is not love, but yet,
  Our meeting I can ne'er forget.

  What, though we never silence broke,
  Our eyes a sweeter language spoke;
  The tongue in flattering falsehood deals,
  And tells a tale it never feels:
  Deceit, the guilty lips impart,
  And hush the mandates of the heart;
  But soul's interpreters, the eyes,
  Spurn such restraint, and scorn disguise.
  As thus our glances oft convers'd,
  And all our bosoms felt rehears'd,
  No spirit, from within, reprov'd us,
  Say rather, "'twas the spirit mov'd us."
  Though, what they utter'd, I repress,
  Yet I conceive thou'lt partly guess;
  For as on thee, my memory ponders,
  Perchance to me, thine also wanders.
  This, for myself, at least, I'll say,
  Thy form appears through night, through day;
  Awake, with it my fancy teems,
  In sleep, it smiles in fleeting dreams;
  The vision charms the hours away,
  And bids me curse Aurora's ray
  For breaking slumbers of delight,
  Which make me wish for endless night.
  Since, oh! whate'er my future fate,
  Shall joy or woe my steps await;
  Tempted by love, by storms beset,
  Thine image, I can ne'er forget.

  Alas! again no more we meet,
  No more our former looks repeat;
  Then, let me breathe this parting prayer,
  The dictate of my bosom's care:
  "May Heaven so guard my lovely quaker,
  That anguish never can o'ertake her;
  That peace and virtue ne'er forsake her,
  But bliss be aye her heart's partaker!
  Oh! may the happy mortal, fated 
  To be, by dearest ties, related,
  For her, each hour, new joys discover, 
  And lose the husband in the lover!
  May that fair bosom never know
  What 'tis to feel the restless woe,
  Which stings the soul, with vain regret,
  Of him, who never can forget!"

TO LESBIA!  

1.

  LESBIA! since far from you I've rang'd, 
    Our souls with fond affection glow not;
  You say, 'tis I, not you, have chang'd,
   I'd tell you why,--but yet I know not.

2.

  Your polish'd brow no cares have crost;
    And Lesbia! we are not much older, 
  Since, trembling, first my heart I lost,
    Or told my love, with hope grown bolder.

3.

  Sixteen was then our utmost age,
    Two years have lingering pass'd away, love!
  And now new thoughts our minds engage,
    At least, I feel disposed to stray, love!

4.

  "Tis I that am alone to blame,
    I, that am guilty of love's treason;
  Since your sweet breast is still the same,
    Caprice must be my only reason.

5.

  I do not, love! suspect your truth,
    With jealous doubt my bosom heaves not;
  Warm was the passion of my youth,
    One trace of dark deceit it leaves not.

6.

  No, no, my flame was not pretended;
    For, oh! I lov'd you most sincerely;
  And though our dream at last is ended
    My bosom still esteems you dearly.

7.

  No more we meet in yonder bowers;
    Absence has made me prone to roving; 
  But older, firmer hearts than ours
    Have found monotony in loving.

8.

  Your cheek's soft bloom is unimpair'd,
    New beauties, still, are daily bright'ning,
  Your eye, for conquest beams prepar'd, 
    The forge of love's resistless lightning.

9.

  Arm'd thus, to make their bosoms bleed,
    Many will throng, to sigh like me, love!
  More constant they may prove, indeed;
    Fonder, alas! they ne'er can be, love!

TO WOMAN.

  Woman! experience might have told me 
  That all must love thee, who behold thee:
  Surely experience might have taught
  Thy firmest promises are nought; 
  But, plac'd in all thy charms before me,
  All I forget, but to adore thee.
  Oh memory! thou choicest blessing,
  When join'd with hope, when still possessing; 
  But how much curst by every lover
  When hope is fled, and passion's over.
  Woman, that fair and fond deceiver,
  How prompt are striplings to believe her!
  How throbs the pulse, when first we view
  The eye that rolls in glossy blue,
  Or sparkles black, or mildly throws
  A beam from under hazel brows!
  How quick we credit every oath,
  And hear her plight the willing troth!
  Fondly we hope 'twill last for ay,
  When, lo! she changes in a day.
  This record will for ever stand,'
  "Woman, thy vows are trac'd in sand."  

AN OCCASIONAL PROLOGUE,

DELIVERED BY THE AUTHOR PREVIOUS TO THE PERFORMANCE OF "THE WHEEL OF
FORTUNE" AT A PRIVATE THEATRE. 

  Since the refinement of this polish'd age
  Has swept immoral raillery from the stage;
  Since taste has now expung'd licentious wit,
  Which stamp'd disgrace on all an author writ;
  Since, now, to please with purer scenes we seek,
  Nor dare to call the blush from Beauty's cheek;
  Oh! let the modest Muse some pity claim,
  And meet indulgence--though she find not fame.
  Still, not for her alone, we wish respect, 
  Others appear more conscious of defect:
  To-night no vet'ran Roscii you behold,
  In all the arts of scenic action old;
  No COOKE, no KEMBLE, can salute you here,
  No SIDDONS draw the sympathetic tear;
  To-night you throng to witness the debut
  Of embryo Actors, to the Drama new:
  Here, then, our almost unfledg'd wings we try;
  Clip not our pinions, ere the birds can fly:
  Failing in this our first attempt to soar,
  Drooping, alas! we fall to rise no more.
  Not one poor trembler, only, fear betrays,
  Who hopes, yet almost dreads to meet your praise;
  But all our Dramatis Personae wait,
  In fond suspense this crisis of their fate.
  No venal views our progress can retard,
  Your generous plaudits are our sole reward;
  For these, each Hero all his power displays, 
  Each timid Heroine shrinks before your gaze:
  Surely the last will some protection find? 
  None, to the softer sex, can prove unkind:
  While Youth and Beauty form the female shield, 
  The sternest Censor to the fair must yield. 
  Yet, should our feeble efforts nought avail,
  Should, after all, our best endeavours fail;
  Still, let some mercy in your bosoms live,
  And, if you can't applaud, at least forgive.

TO ELIZA. 

1.

  Eliza!  what fools are the Mussulman sect,
    Who, to woman, deny the soul's future existence;
  Could they see thee, Eliza! they'd own their defect,
    And this doctrine would meet with a general resistance. 

2.

  Had their Prophet possess'd half an atom of sense, 
    He ne'er would have woman from Paradise driven;
  Instead of his Houris, a flimsy pretence, 
    With woman alone he had peopled his Heaven.

3.

  Yet, still, to increase your calamities more, 
    Not content with depriving your bodies of spirit,
  He allots one poor husband to share amongst four! --
    With souls you'd dispense; but, this last, who could bear it?

4.

  His religion to please neither party is made;
    On husbands 'tis hard, to the wives most uncivil;
  Still I can't contradict,  what so oft has been said,
    "Though women are angels, yet wedlock's the devil."

5.

  This terrible truth, even Scripture has told, 
    Ye Benedicks! hear me, and listen with rapture;
  If a glimpse of redemption you wish to behold,
    Of ST. MATT.--read the second and twentieth chapter.

6.

  'Tis surely enough upon earth to be vex'd,
    With wives who eternal confusion are spreading;
  "But in Heaven" (so runs the Evangelists' Text)
    "We neither have giving in marriage, or wedding."

7.

  From this we suppose, (as indeed well we may,)
    That should Saints after death, with their spouses put up more,
  And wives, as in life, aim at absolute sway,
    All Heaven would ring with the conjugal uproar.

8.

  Distraction and Discord would follow in course,
    Nor MATTHEW, nor MARK, nor ST. PAUL, can deny it,
  The only expedient is general divorce,
    To prevent universal disturbance and riot.

9.

  But though husband and wife, shall at length be disjoin'd,
    Yet woman and man ne'er were meant to dissever,
  Our chains once dissolv'd, and our hearts unconfin'd,
    We'll love without bonds, but we'll love you for ever.

10.

  Though souls are denied you by fools and by rakes,
    Should you own it yourselves, I would even then doubt you,
  Your nature so much of celestial partakes,
    The Garden of Eden would wither without you.

THE TEAR.

    O lachrymarum fons, tenero sacros
    Ducentium ortus ex animo; quater
      Felix! in imo qui scatentem
        Pectore te, pia Nympha, sensit. 

                 GRAY, 'Alcaic Fragment'.

1.

     When Friendship or Love
     Our sympathies move;
  When Truth, in a glance, should appear,
     The lips may beguile,
     With a dimple or smile,
  But the test of affection's a Tear.

2.

     Too oft is a smile
     But the hypocrite's wile,
  To mask detestation, or fear;
     Give me the soft sigh,
     Whilst the soul-telling eye
  Is dimm'd, for a time, with a Tear.

3.

     Mild Charity's glow,
     To us mortals below,
  Shows the soul from barbarity clear;
     Compassion will melt,
     Where this virtue is felt,
  And its dew is diffused in a Tear.

4.

     The man, doom'd to sail
     With the blast of the gale,
  Through billows Atlantic to steer,
     As he bends o'er the wave
     Which may soon be his grave,
  The green sparkles bright with a Tear.

5.

     The Soldier braves death
     For a fanciful wreath
  In Glory's romantic career;
     But he raises the foe
     When in battle laid low,
  And bathes every wound with a Tear.

6.

     If, with high-bounding pride,
     He return to his bride!
  Renouncing the gore-crimson'd spear;
     All his toils are repaid
     When, embracing the maid,
  From her eyelid he kisses the Tear.

7.

     Sweet scene of my youth! 
     Seat of Friendship and Truth,
  Where Love chas'd each fast-fleeting year;
     Loth to leave thee, I mourn'd,
     For a last look I turn'd,
  But thy spire was scarce seen through a Tear.

8.

     Though my vows I can pour,
     To my Mary no more, 
  My Mary, to Love once so dear,
    In the shade of her bow'r,
    I remember the hour,
  She rewarded those vows with a Tear.

9.

     By another possest,
     May she live ever blest!
  Her name still my heart must revere:
     With a sigh I resign,
     What I once thought was mine,
  And forgive her deceit with a Tear.

10.

     Ye friends of my heart,
     Ere from you I depart,
  This hope to my breast is most near:
     If again we shall meet,
     In this rural retreat,
  May we meet, as we part, with a Tear.

11.

     When my soul wings her flight
     To the regions of night,
  And my corse shall recline on its bier; 
    As ye pass by the tomb,
    Where my ashes consume,
  Oh! moisten their dust with a Tear.

12.

    May no marble bestow
    The splendour of woe,
  Which the children of Vanity rear;
    No fiction of fame
    Shall blazon my name,
  All I ask, all I wish, is a Tear.

REPLY TO SOME VERSES OF J. M. B. PIGOT, ESQ.,
ON THE CRUELTY OF HIS MISTRESS. 

1.

    Why, Pigot, complain
    Of this damsel's disdain,
  Why thus in despair do you fret?
    For months you may try,
    Yet, believe me, a sigh 
  Will never obtain a coquette.

2.

     Would you teach her to love?
     For a time seem to rove;
  At first she may frown in a pet;
     But leave her awhile,
     She shortly will smile,
  And then you may kiss your coquette.

3.

     For such are the airs
     Of these fanciful fairs,
  They think all our homage a debt:
     Yet a partial neglect 
     Soon takes an effect,
  And humbles the proudest coquette.

4.

     Dissemble your pain,
     And lengthen your chain,
  And seem her hauteur to regret; 
     If again you shall sigh,
     She no more will deny,
  That yours is the rosy coquette.

5.

     If still, from false pride, 
     Your pangs she deride,
  This whimsical virgin forget;
     Some other admire,
     Who will melt with your fire,
  And laugh at the little coquette.

6.

     For me, I adore
     Some twenty or more,
  And love them most dearly; but yet,
     Though my heart they enthral,
     I'd abandon them all,
  Did they act like your blooming coquette.

7.

     No longer repine,
     Adopt this design, 
  And break through her slight-woven net!
     Away with despair,
     No longer forbear
  To fly from the captious coquette.

8.

    Then quit her, my friend!
    Your bosom defend,
  Ere quite with her snares you're beset:
    Lest your deep-wounded heart,
    When incens'd by the smart,
  Should lead you to curse the coquette.

GRANTA. A MEDLEY.

(Reply of the Pythian Oracle to Philip of Macedon.)

1.

  Oh! could LE SAGE'S  demon's gift
    Be realis'd at my desire,
  This night my trembling form he'd lift
    To place it on St. Mary's spire. 

2.

  Then would, unroof'd, old Granta's halls,
    Pedantic inmates full display;
  Fellows who dream on lawn or stalls,
    The price of venal votes to pay. 

3.

  Then would I view each rival wight,
    PETTY and PALMERSTON survey;
  Who canvass there, with all their might, 
    Against the next elective day. 

4.

  Lo! candidates and voters lie 
    All lull'd in sleep, a goodly number!
  A race renown'd for piety,
    Whose conscience won't disturb their slumber.

5.

  Lord H--- indeed, may not demur;
    Fellows are sage, reflecting men:
  They know preferment can occur,
    But very seldom,--now and then.

6.

  They know the Chancellor has got
    Some pretty livings in disposal:
  Each hopes that one may be his lot,
    And, therefore, smiles on his proposal. 

7.

  Now from the soporific scene 
    I'll turn mine eye, as night grows later,
  To view, unheeded and unseen, 
    The studious sons of Alma Mater.

8.

  There, in apartments small and damp,
    The candidate for college prizes,
  Sits poring by the midnight lamp;
    Goes late to bed, yet early rises. 

9.

  He surely well deserves to gain them,
    With all the honours of his college, 
  Who, striving hardly to obtain them,
    Thus seeks unprofitable knowledge:

10.

  Who sacrifices hours of rest,
    To scan precisely metres Attic;
  Or agitates his anxious breast, 
    In solving problems mathematic:

11.

  Who reads false quantities in Seale, 
    Or puzzles o'er the deep triangle;
  Depriv'd of many a wholesome meal; 
    In barbarous Latin  doom'd to wrangle:

12.

  Renouncing every pleasing page,
    From authors of historic use;
  Preferring to the letter'd sage,
    The square of the hypothenuse. 

13.

  Still, harmless are these occupations, 
  That hurt none but the hapless student,
  Compar'd with other recreations,
  Which bring together the imprudent;

14.

  Whose daring revels shock the sight,
  When vice and infamy combine,
  When Drunkenness and dice invite, 
  As every sense is steep'd in wine.

15.

  Not so the methodistic crew,
  Who plans of reformation lay:
  In humble attitude they sue,
  And for the sins of others pray:

16.

  Forgetting that their pride of spirit,
  Their exultation in their trial, 
  Detracts most largely from the merit
  Of all their boasted self-denial.

17.

  'Tis morn:--from these I turn my sight:
  What scene is this which meets the eye?
  A numerous crowd array'd in white, 
  Across the green in numbers fly.

18.

  Loud rings in air the chapel bell;
  'Tis hush'd:--what sounds are these I hear?
  The organ's soft celestial swell
  Rolls deeply on the listening ear.

19.

  To this is join'd the sacred song,
  The royal minstrel's hallow'd strain;
  Though he who hears the music long, 
  Will never wish to hear again.

20.

  Our choir would scarcely be excus'd,
  E'en as a band of raw beginners;
  All mercy, now, must be refus'd 
  To such a set of croaking sinners.

21.

  If David, when his toils were ended,
  Had heard these blockheads sing before him,
  To us his psalms had ne'er descended,--
  In furious mood he would have tore 'em.

22.

  The luckless Israelites, when taken
  By some inhuman tyrant's order,
  Were ask'd to sing, by joy forsaken,
  On Babylonian river's border.

23.

  Oh! had they sung in notes like these 
  Inspir'd by stratagem or fear,
  They might have set their hearts at ease,
  The devil a soul had stay'd to hear.

24.

  But if I scribble longer now, 
  The deuce a soul will stay to read;
  My pen is blunt, my ink is low;
  'Tis almost time to stop, indeed.

25.

  Therefore, farewell, old Granta's spires!
  No more, like Cleofas, I fly;
  No more thy theme my Muse inspires:
  The reader's tir'd, and so am I.

TO THE SIGHING STREPHON. 

1.

  Your pardon, my friend,
  If my rhymes did offend,
  Your pardon, a thousand times o'er;
  From friendship I strove,
  Your pangs to remove,
  But, I swear, I will do so no more.

2.

  Since your beautiful maid,
  Your flame has repaid,
  No more I your folly regret;
  She's now most divine,
  And I bow at the shrine,
  Of this quickly reformed coquette.

3.

  Yet still, I must own, 
  I should never have known,
  From your verses, what else she deserv'd;
  Your pain seem'd so great,
  I pitied your fate,
  As your fair was so dev'lish reserv'd.

4.

  Since the balm-breathing kiss 
  Of this magical Miss,
  Can such wonderful transports produce; 
  Since the "world you forget,
  When your lips once have met,"
  My counsel will get but abuse.

5.

  You say, "When I rove,"
  "I know nothing of love;"
  Tis true, I am given to range;
  If I rightly remember,
  I've lov'd a good number; 
  Yet there's pleasure, at least, in a change.

6.

  I will not advance, 
  By the rules of romance,
  To humour a whimsical fair;
  Though a smile may delight,
  Yet a frown will affright, 
  Or drive me to dreadful despair.

7.

  While my blood is thus warm,
  I ne'er shall reform,
  To mix in the Platonists' school;
  Of this I am sure,
  Was my Passion so pure,
  Thy Mistress would think me a fool. 

8 

  And if I should shun,
  Every woman for one,
  Whose image must fill my whole breast;
  Whom I must prefer,
  And sigh but for her,
  What an insult 'twould be to the rest!

9.

  Now Strephon, good-bye;
  I cannot deny,
  Your passion appears most absurd;
  Such love as you plead,
  Is pure love, indeed,
  For it only consists in the word.

THE CORNELIAN. 

1.

  No specious splendour of this stone
  Endears it to my memory ever;
  With lustre only once it shone,
  And blushes modest as the giver. 

2.

  Some, who can sneer at friendship's ties,
  Have, for my weakness, oft reprov'd me;
  Yet still the simple gift I prize,
  For I am sure, the giver lov'd me.

3.

  He offer'd it with downcast look,
  As fearful that I might refuse it;
  I told him, when the gift I took,
  My only fear should be, to lose it.

4.

  This pledge attentively I view'd,
  And sparkling as I held it near,
  Methought one drop the stone bedew'd,
  And, ever since, I've lov'd a tear.

5.

  Still, to adorn his humble youth,
  Nor wealth nor birth their treasures yield;
  But he, who seeks the flowers of truth,
  Must quit the garden, for the field.

6.

  'Tis not the plant uprear'd in sloth,
  Which beauty shews, and sheds perfume;
  The flowers, which yield the most of both,
  In Nature's wild luxuriance bloom.

7.

  Had Fortune aided Nature's care,
  For once forgetting to be blind,
  His would have been an ample share,
  If well proportioned to his mind.

8.

  But had the Goddess clearly seen,
  His form had fix'd her fickle breast;
  Her countless hoards would his have been,
  And none remain'd to give the rest.

TO M----

1.

  Oh! did those eyes, instead of fire,
    With bright, but mild affection shine:
  Though they might kindle less desire,
    Love, more than mortal, would be thine.

2.

  For thou art form'd so heavenly fair,
    Howe'er those orbs may wildly beam,
  We must admire, but still despair;
    That fatal glance forbids esteem.

3.

  When Nature stamp'd thy beauteous birth,
    So much perfection in thee shone,
  She fear'd that, too divine for earth,
    The skies might claim thee for their own.

4.

  Therefore, to guard her dearest work,
    Lest angels might dispute the prize,
  She bade a secret lightning lurk,
    Within those once celestial eyes.

5.

  These might the boldest Sylph appall,
    When gleaming with meridian blaze;
  Thy beauty must enrapture all;
    But who can dare thine ardent gaze?

6.

  'Tis said that Berenice's hair,
    In stars adorns the vault of heaven;
  But they would ne'er permit thee there,
    Thou wouldst so far outshine the seven.

7.

  For did those eyes as planets roll,
    Thy sister-lights would scarce appear:
  E'en suns, which systems now controul,
    Would twinkle dimly through their sphere. 

LINES ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY.

1.

  Doubtless, sweet girl! the hissing lead,
    Wafting destruction o'er thy charms 
  And hurtling o'er  thy lovely head,
    Has fill'd that breast with fond alarms.

2.

  Surely some envious Demon's force,
    Vex'd to behold such beauty here,
  Impell'd the bullet's viewless course,
    Diverted from its first career.

3.

  Yes! in that nearly fatal hour,
    The ball obey'd some hell-born guide;
  But Heaven, with interposing power,
    In pity turn'd the death aside.

4.

  Yet, as perchance one trembling tear
    Upon that thrilling bosom fell;
  Which I, th' unconscious cause of fear,
    Extracted from its glistening cell;--

5.

  Say, what dire penance can atone
    For such an outrage, done to thee?
  Arraign'd before thy beauty's throne,
    What punishment wilt thou decree?

6.

  Might I perform the Judge's part,
    The sentence I should scarce deplore;
  It only would restore a heart,
    Which but belong'd to thee before.

7.

  The least atonement I can make
    Is to become no longer free;
  Henceforth, I breathe but for thy sake,
    Thou shalt be all in all to me.

8.

  But thou, perhaps, may'st now reject
    Such expiation of my guilt;
  Come then--some other mode elect?
    Let it be death--or what thou wilt.

9.

  Choose, then, relentless! and I swear
    Nought shall thy dread decree prevent;
  Yet hold--one little word forbear!
    Let it be aught but banishment.

TRANSLATION FROM CATULLUS.

AD LESBIAM.

  Equal to Jove that youth must be--
  Greater than Jove he seems to me--
  Who, free from Jealousy's alarms,
  Securely views thy matchless charms;
  That cheek, which ever dimpling glows,
  That mouth, from whence such music flows,
  To him, alike, are always known,
  Reserv'd for him, and him alone.
  Ah! Lesbia! though 'tis death to me,
  I cannot choose but look on thee;
  But, at the sight, my senses fly,
  I needs must gaze, but, gazing, die;
  Whilst trembling with a thousand fears,
  Parch'd to the throat my tongue adheres,
  My pulse beats quick, my breath heaves short,
  My limbs deny their slight support;
  Cold dews my pallid face o'erspread,
  With deadly languor droops my head,
  My ears with tingling echoes ring,
  And Life itself is on the wing;
  My eyes refuse the cheering light,
  Their orbs are veil'd in starless night:
  Such pangs my nature sinks beneath,
  And feels a temporary death.

TRANSLATION OF THE EPITAPH ON VIRGIL
AND TIBULLUS, BY DOMITIUS MARSUS.

  He who, sublime, in epic numbers roll'd,
  And he who struck the softer lyre of Love,
  By Death's unequal hand alike controul'd,
  Fit comrades in Elysian regions move!

IMITATION OF TIBULLUS.

SULPICIA AD CERINTHUM (LIB. QUART.).

  Cruel Cerinthus! does the fell disease 
  Which racks my breast your fickle bosom please?
  Alas! I wish'd but to o'ercome the pain,
  That I might live for Love and you again;
  But, now, I scarcely shall bewail my fate:
  By Death alone I can avoid your hate.

TRANSLATION FROM CATULLUS.

LUGETE VENERES CUPIDINESQUE (CARM. III.) 

  Ye Cupids, droop each little head,
  Nor let your wings with joy be spread,
  My Lesbia's favourite bird is dead,
    Whom dearer than her eyes she lov'd: 
  For he was gentle, and so true,
  Obedient to her call he flew,
  No fear, no wild alarm he knew,
    But lightly o'er her bosom mov'd:

  And softly fluttering here and there,
  He never sought to cleave the air,
  He chirrup'd oft, and, free from care, 
    Tun'd to her ear his grateful strain.
  Now having pass'd the gloomy bourn, 
  From whence he never can return,
  His death, and Lesbia's grief I mourn,
    Who sighs, alas! but sighs in vain.

  Oh! curst be thou, devouring grave!
  Whose jaws eternal victims crave,
  From whom no earthly power can save,
    For thou hast ta'en the bird away:
  From thee my Lesbia's eyes o'erflow,
  Her swollen cheeks with weeping glow;
  Thou art the cause of all her woe,
    Receptacle of life's decay.

IMITATED FROM CATULLUS. 

TO ELLEN. 

  Oh! might I kiss those eyes of fire,
  A million scarce would quench desire;
  Still would I steep my lips in bliss,
  And dwell an age on every kiss;
  Nor then my soul should sated be,
  Still would I kiss and cling to thee:
  Nought should my kiss from thine dissever,
  Still would we kiss and kiss for ever;
  E'en though the numbers did exceed 
  The yellow harvest's countless seed;
  To part would be a vain endeavour:
  Could I desist?--ah! never--never.

TO M. S. G.

1.

  Whene'er I view those lips of thine,
    Their hue invites my fervent kiss;
  Yet, I forego that bliss divine,
    Alas! it were--unhallow'd bliss.

2.

  Whene'er I dream of that pure breast,
    How could I dwell upon its snows!
  Yet, is the daring wish represt,
    For that,--would banish its repose.

3.

  A glance from thy soul-searching eye
    Can raise with hope, depress with fear;
  Yet, I conceal my love,--and why?
    I would not force a painful tear.

4.

  I ne'er have told my love, yet thou
    Hast seen my ardent flame too well;
  And shall I plead my passion now,
    To make thy bosom's heaven a hell?

5.

  No! for thou never canst be mine,
    United by the priest's decree:
  By any ties but those divine,
    Mine, my belov'd, thou ne'er shalt be.

6.

  Then let the secret fire consume,
    Let it consume, thou shalt not know:
  With joy I court a certain doom,
    Rather than spread its guilty glow.

7.

  I will not ease my tortur'd heart,
    By driving dove-ey'd peace from thine;
  Rather than such a sting impart,
    Each thought presumptuous I resign.

8.

  Yes! yield those lips, for which I'd brave
    More than I here shall dare to tell;
  Thy innocence and mine to save,--
    I bid thee now a last farewell.

9.

  Yes! yield that breast, to seek despair
    And hope no more thy soft embrace;
  Which to obtain, my soul would dare,
    All, all reproach, but thy disgrace.

10.

  At least from guilt shall thou be free,
    No matron shall thy shame reprove;
  Though cureless pangs may prey on me,
    No martyr shall thou be to love.

STANZAS TO A LADY, WITH THE POEMS OF CAMOENS. 

1.

  This votive pledge of fond esteem,
    Perhaps, dear girl! for me thou'lt prize;
  It sings of Love's enchanting dream,
    A theme we never can despise.

2.

  Who blames it but the envious fool,
    The old and disappointed maid?
  Or pupil of the prudish school,
    In single sorrow doom'd to fade?

3.

  Then read, dear Girl! with feeling read,
    For thou wilt ne'er be one of those;
  To thee, in vain, I shall not plead
    In pity for the Poet's woes.

4.

  He was, in sooth, a genuine Bard;
    His was no faint, fictitious flame:
  Like his, may Love be thy reward,
    But not thy hapless fate the same.

TO M. S. G. 

1.

  When I dream that you love me, you'll surely forgive;
    Extend not your anger to sleep;
  For in visions alone your affection can live,--
    I rise, and it leaves me to weep.

2.

  Then, Morpheus! envelop my faculties fast,
    Shed o'er me your languor benign;
  Should the dream of to-night but resemble the last,
    What rapture celestial is mine!

3.

  They tell us that slumber, the sister of death,
    Mortality's emblem is given;
  To fate how I long to resign my frail breath,
    If this be a foretaste of Heaven!

4.

  Ah! frown not, sweet Lady, unbend your soft brow,
    Nor deem me too happy in this;
  If I sin in my dream, I atone for it now,
    Thus doom'd, but to gaze upon bliss.

5.

  Though in visions, sweet Lady, perhaps you may smile,
    Oh! think not my penance deficient!
  When dreams of your presence my slumbers beguile,
    To awake, will be torture sufficient.

TRANSLATION FROM HORACE.

        Justum et tenacem propositi virum.

        HOR. 'Odes', iii. 3. I.

1.

    The man of firm and noble soul
    No factious clamours can controul;
    No threat'ning tyrant's darkling brow
      Can swerve him from his just intent:
    Gales the warring waves which plough,
      By Auster on the billows spent,
    To curb the Adriatic main,
Would awe his fix'd determined mind in vain.

2.

    Aye, and the red right arm of Jove,
    Hurtling his lightnings from above,
    With all his terrors there unfurl'd,
      He would, unmov'd, unaw'd, behold;
    The flames of an expiring world,
      Again in crashing chaos roll'd,
    In vast promiscuous ruin hurl'd,
    Might light his glorious funeral pile:
Still dauntless 'midst the wreck of earth he'd smile.

THE FIRST KISS OF LOVE.

ANACREON .

1.

  Away with your fictions of flimsy romance,
    Those tissues of falsehood which Folly has wove; 
  Give me the mild beam of the soul-breathing glance,
    Or the rapture which dwells on the first kiss of love.

2.

  Ye rhymers, whose bosoms with fantasy glow, 
    Whose pastoral passions are made for the grove;
  From what blest inspiration your sonnets would flow, 
    Could you ever have tasted the first kiss of love.

3.

  If Apollo should e'er his assistance refuse,
    Or the Nine be dispos'd from your service to rove,
  Invoke them no more, bid adieu to the Muse,
    And try the effect, of the first kiss of love.

4.

  I hate you, ye cold compositions of art,
    Though prudes may condemn me, and bigots reprove;
  I court the effusions that spring from the heart,
    Which throbs, with delight, to the first kiss of love. 

5.

  Your shepherds, your flocks, those fantastical themes, 
    Perhaps may amuse, yet they never can move:
  Arcadia displays but a region of dreams; 
    What are visions like these, to the first kiss of love?

6.

  Oh! cease to affirm that man, since his birth, 
    From Adam, till now, has with wretchedness strove;
  Some portion of Paradise still is on earth,
    And Eden revives, in the first kiss of love.

7.

  When age chills the blood, when our pleasures are past--
  For years fleet away with the wings of the dove--
  The dearest remembrance will still be the last,
  Our sweetest memorial, the first kiss of love.

CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. 

    "I cannot but remember such things were,
    And were most dear to me."

    'Macbeth' 

  When slow Disease, with all her host of Pains, 
  Chills the warm tide, which flows along the veins;
  When Health, affrighted, spreads her rosy wing,
  And flies with every changing gale of spring;
  Not to the aching frame alone confin'd,
  Unyielding pangs assail the drooping mind:
  What grisly forms, the spectre-train of woe,
  Bid shuddering Nature shrink beneath the blow,
  With Resignation wage relentless strife,
  While Hope retires appall'd, and clings to life.
  Yet less the pang when, through the tedious hour,
  Remembrance sheds around her genial power,
  Calls back the vanish'd days to rapture given,
  When Love was bliss, and Beauty form'd our heaven;
  Or, dear to youth, pourtrays each childish scene,
  Those fairy bowers, where all in turn have been.
  As when, through clouds that pour the summer storm,
  The orb of day unveils his distant form,
  Gilds with faint beams the crystal dews of rain
  And dimly twinkles o'er the watery plain;
  Thus, while the future dark and cheerless gleams,
  The Sun of Memory, glowing through my dreams,
  Though sunk the radiance of his former blaze,
  To scenes far distant points his paler rays,
  Still rules my senses with unbounded sway,
  The past confounding with the present day.

  Oft does my heart indulge the rising thought,
  Which still recurs, unlook'd for and unsought;
  My soul to Fancy's fond suggestion yields,
  And roams romantic o'er her airy fields.
  Scenes of my youth, develop'd, crowd to view,
  To which I long have bade a last adieu!
  Seats of delight, inspiring youthful themes;
  Friends lost to me, for aye, except in dreams;
  Some, who in marble prematurely sleep,
  Whose forms I now remember, but to weep;
  Some, who yet urge the same scholastic course
  Of early science, future fame the source;
  Who, still contending in the studious race,
  In quick rotation, fill the senior place!
  These, with a thousand visions, now unite,
  To dazzle, though they please, my aching sight. 

  IDA! blest spot, where Science holds her reign,
  How joyous, once, I join'd thy youthful train!
  Bright, in idea, gleams thy lofty spire,
  Again, I mingle with thy playful quire;
  Our tricks of mischief,  every childish game,
  Unchang'd by time or distance, seem the same;
  Through winding paths, along the glade I trace
  The social smile of every welcome face;
  My wonted haunts, my scenes of joy or woe,
  Each early boyish friend, or youthful foe,
  Our feuds dissolv'd, but not my friendship past,--
  I bless the former, and forgive the last.
  Hours of my youth! when, nurtur'd in my breast,
  To Love a stranger, Friendship made me blest,--
  Friendship, the dear peculiar bond of youth,
  When every artless bosom throbs with truth;
  Untaught by worldly wisdom how to feign,
  And check each impulse with prudential rein;
  When, all we feel, our honest souls disclose,
  In love to friends, in open hate to foes;
  No varnish'd tales the lips of youth repeat,
  No dear-bought knowledge purchased by deceit;
  Hypocrisy, the gift of lengthen'd years,
  Matured by age, the garb of Prudence wears: 
  When, now, the Boy is ripen'd into Man,
  His careful Sire chalks forth some wary plan;
  Instructs his Son from Candour's path to shrink,
  Smoothly to speak, and cautiously to think;
  Still to assent, and never to deny--
  A patron's praise can well reward the lie:
  And who, when Fortune's warning voice is heard,
  Would lose his opening prospects for a word?
  Although, against that word, his heart rebel,
  And Truth, indignant, all his bosom swell.

    Away with themes like this! not mine the task,
  From flattering friends to tear the hateful mask;
  Let keener bards delight in Satire's sting,
  My Fancy soars not on Detraction's wing:
  Once, and but once, she aim'd a deadly blow,
  To hurl Defiance on a secret Foe;
  But when that foe, from feeling or from shame,
  The cause unknown, yet still to me the same,
  Warn'd by some friendly hint, perchance, retir'd,
  With this submission all her rage expired.
  From dreaded pangs that feeble Foe to save,
  She hush'd her young resentment, and forgave.
  Or, if my Muse a Pedant's portrait drew,
  POMPOSUS'  virtues are but known to few:
  I never fear'd the young usurper's nod,
  And he who wields must, sometimes, feel the rod.
  If since on Granta's failings, known to all
  Who share the converse of a college hall,
  She sometimes trifled in a lighter strain,
  'Tis past, and thus she will not sin again:
  Soon must her early song for ever cease,
  And, all may rail, when I shall rest in peace.

    Here, first remember'd be the joyous band,
  Who hail'd me chief,  obedient to command;
  Who join'd with me, in every boyish sport,
  Their first adviser, and their last resort;
  Nor shrunk beneath the upstart pedant's frown, 
  Or all the sable glories of his gown; 
  Who, thus, transplanted from his father's school,
  Unfit to govern, ignorant of rule--
  Succeeded him, whom all unite to praise,
  The dear preceptor of my early days,
  PROBUS,  the pride of science, and the boast--
  To IDA now, alas! for ever lost!
  With him, for years, we search'd the classic page, 
  And fear'd the Master, though we lov'd the Sage:
  Retir'd at last, his small yet peaceful seat
  From learning's labour is the blest retreat.
  POMPOSUS fills his magisterial chair;
  POMPOSUS governs,--but, my Muse, forbear:
  Contempt, in silence, be the pedant's lot, 
  His name and precepts be alike forgot;
  No more his mention shall my verse degrade,--
  To him my tribute is already paid.

    High, through those elms with hoary branches crown'd 
  Fair IDA'S bower adorns the landscape round;
  There Science, from her favour'd seat, surveys
  The vale where rural Nature claims her praise;
  To her awhile resigns her youthful train,
  Who move in joy, and dance along the plain;
  In scatter'd groups, each favour'd haunt pursue,
  Repeat old pastimes, and discover new;
  Flush'd with his rays, beneath the noontide Sun,
  In rival bands, between the wickets run,
  Drive o'er the sward the ball with active force,
  Or chase with nimble feet its rapid course.
  But these with slower steps direct their way,
  Where Brent's cool waves in limpid currents stray,
  While yonder few search out some green retreat,
  And arbours shade them from the summer heat:
  Others, again, a pert and lively crew,
  Some rough and thoughtless stranger plac'd in view,
  With frolic quaint their antic jests expose,
  And tease the grumbling rustic as he goes;
  Nor rest with this, but many a passing fray
  Tradition treasures for a future day:
  "'Twas here the gather'd swains for vengeance fought,
  And here we earn'd the conquest dearly bought:
  Here have we fled before superior might,
  And here renew'd the wild tumultuous fight."
  While thus our souls with early passions swell,
  In lingering tones resounds the distant bell;
  Th' allotted hour of daily sport is o'er,
  And Learning beckons from her temple's door.
  No splendid tablets grace her simple hall,
  But ruder records fill the dusky wall:
  There, deeply carv'd, behold! each Tyro's name
  Secures its owner's academic fame;
  Here mingling view the names of Sire and Son,
  The one long grav'd, the other just begun:
  These shall survive alike when Son and Sire,
  Beneath one common stroke of fate expire; 
  Perhaps, their last memorial these alone,
  Denied, in death, a monumental stone,
  Whilst to the gale in mournful cadence wave
  The sighing weeds, that hide their nameless grave.
  And, here, my name, and many an early friend's,
  Along the wall in lengthen'd line extends.
  Though, still, our deeds amuse the youthful race,
  Who tread our steps, and fill our former place,
  Who young obeyed their lords in silent awe,
  Whose nod commanded, and whose voice was law;
  And now, in turn, possess the reins of power,
  To rule, the little Tyrants of an hour;
  Though sometimes, with the Tales of ancient day,
  They pass the dreary Winter's eve away;
  "And, thus, our former rulers stemm'd the tide,
  And, thus, they dealt the combat, side by side;
  Just in this place, the mouldering walls they scaled,
  Nor bolts, nor bars, against their strength avail'd;
  Here PROBUS came, the rising fray to quell,
  And, here, he falter'd forth his last farewell;
  And, here, one night abroad they dared to roam,
  While bold POMPOSUS bravely staid at home;"
  While thus they speak, the hour must soon arrive,
  When names of these, like ours, alone survive:
  Yet a few years, one general wreck will whelm
  The faint remembrance of our fairy realm.

    Dear honest race! though now we meet no more,
  One last long look on what we were before--
  Our first kind greetings, and our last adieu--
  Drew tears from eyes unus'd to weep with you.
  Through splendid circles, Fashion's gaudy world,
  Where Folly's glaring standard waves unfurl'd,
  I plung'd to drown in noise my fond regret,
  And all I sought or hop'd was to forget:
  Vain wish! if, chance, some well-remember'd face,
  Some old companion of my early race,
  Advanc'd to claim his friend with honest joy,
  My eyes, my heart, proclaim'd me still a boy;
  The glittering scene, the fluttering groups around,
  Were quite forgotten when my friend was found;
  The smiles of Beauty, (for, alas! I've known
  What 'tis to bend before Love's mighty throne;)
  The smiles of Beauty, though those smiles were dear,
  Could hardly charm me, when that friend was near:
  My thoughts bewilder'd in the fond surprise,
  The woods of IDA danc'd before my eyes;
  I saw the sprightly wand'rers pour along,
  I saw, and join'd again the joyous throng;
  Panting, again I trac'd her lofty grove,
  And Friendship's feelings triumph'd over Love.

    Yet, why should I alone with such delight
  Retrace the circuit of my former flight?
  Is there no cause beyond the common claim,
  Endear'd to all in childhood's very name?
  Ah! sure some stronger impulse vibrates here,
  Which whispers friendship will be doubly dear
  To one, who thus for kindred hearts must roam,
  And seek abroad, the love denied at home.
  Those hearts, dear IDA, have I found in thee,
  A home, a world, a paradise to me.
  Stern Death forbade my orphan youth to share
  The tender guidance of a Father's care;
  Can Rank, or e'en a Guardian's name supply
  The love, which glistens in a Father's eye?
  For this, can Wealth, or Title's sound atone,
  Made, by a Parent's early loss, my own?
  What Brother springs a Brother's love to seek?
  What Sister's gentle kiss has prest my cheek?
  For me, how dull the vacant moments rise,
  To no fond bosom link'd by kindred ties!
  Oft, in the progress of some fleeting dream,
  Fraternal smiles, collected round me seem;
  While still the visions to my heart are prest,
  The voice of Love will murmur in my rest:
  I hear--I wake--and in the sound rejoice!
  I hear again,--but, ah! no Brother's voice.
  A Hermit, 'midst of crowds, I fain must stray
  Alone, though thousand pilgrims fill the way;
  While these a thousand kindred wreaths entwine,
  I cannot call one single blossom mine:
  What then remains? in solitude to groan,
  To mix in friendship, or to sigh alone?
  Thus, must I cling to some endearing hand,
  And none more dear, than IDA'S social band.

    Alonzo!  best and dearest of my friends, 
  Thy name ennobles him, who thus commends:
  From this fond tribute thou canst gain no praise;
  The praise is his, who now that tribute pays.
  Oh! in the promise of thy early youth,
  If Hope anticipate the words of Truth!
  Some loftier bard shall sing thy glorious name,
  To build his own, upon thy deathless fame:
  Friend of my heart, and foremost of the list
  Of those with whom I lived supremely blest;
  Oft have we drain'd the font of ancient lore,
  Though drinking deeply, thirsting still the more;
  Yet, when Confinement's lingering hour was done,
  Our sports, our studies, and our souls were one:
  Together we impell'd the flying ball,
  Together waited in our tutor's hall;
  Together join'd in cricket's manly toil,
  Or shar'd the produce of the river's spoil;
  Or plunging from the green declining shore,
  Our pliant limbs the buoyant billows bore: 
  In every element, unchang'd, the same,
  All, all that brothers should be, but the name.

    Nor, yet, are you forgot, my jocund Boy!
  DAVUS,  the harbinger of childish joy;
  For ever foremost in the ranks of fun,
  The laughing herald of the harmless pun;
  Yet, with a breast of such materials made,
  Anxious to please, of pleasing half afraid;
  Candid and liberal, with a heart of steel
  In Danger's path, though not untaught to feel.
  Still, I remember, in the factious strife,
  The rustic's musket aim'd against my life: 
  High pois'd in air the massy weapon hung,
  A cry of horror burst from every tongue:
  Whilst I, in combat with another foe,
  Fought on, unconscious of th' impending blow;
  Your arm, brave Boy, arrested his career--
  Forward you sprung, insensible to fear;
  Disarm'd, and baffled by your conquering hand,
  The grovelling Savage roll'd upon the sand:
  An act like this, can simple thanks repay? 
  Or all the labours of a grateful lay?
  Oh no! whene'er my breast forgets the deed,
  That instant, DAVUS, it deserves to bleed.

    LYCUS!  on me thy claims are justly great:
  Thy milder virtues could my Muse relate,
  To thee, alone, unrivall'd, would belong
  The feeble efforts of my lengthen'd song.
  Well canst thou boast, to lead in senates fit,
  A Spartan firmness, with Athenian wit:
  Though yet, in embryo, these perfections shine,
  LYCUS! thy father's fame  will soon be thine.
  Where Learning nurtures the superior mind,
  What may we hope, from genius thus refin'd;
  When Time, at length, matures thy growing years,
  How wilt thou tower, above thy fellow peers!
  Prudence and sense, a spirit bold and free,
  With Honour's soul, united beam in thee.

  Shall fair EURYALUS, pass by unsung?
  From ancient lineage, not unworthy, sprung:
  What, though one sad dissension bade us part,
  That name is yet embalm'd within my heart,
  Yet, at the mention, does that heart rebound,
  And palpitate, responsive to the sound;
  Envy dissolved our ties, and not our will:
  We once were friends,--I'll think, we are so still.
  A form unmatch'd in Nature's partial mould,
  A heart untainted, we, in thee, behold:
  Yet, not the Senate's thunder thou shall wield,
  Nor seek for glory, in the tented field:
  To minds of ruder texture, these be given--
  Thy soul shall nearer soar its native heaven.
  Haply, in polish'd courts might be thy seat,
  But, that thy tongue could never forge deceit:
  The courtier's supple bow, and sneering smile,
  The flow of compliment, the slippery wile,
  Would make that breast, with indignation, burn,
  And, all the glittering snares, to tempt thee, spurn.
  Domestic happiness will stamp thy fate;
  Sacred to love, unclouded e'er by hate;
  The world admire thee, and thy friends adore;--
  Ambition's slave, alone, would toil for more. 

    Now last, but nearest, of the social band,
  See honest, open, generous CLEON  stand;
  With scarce one speck, to cloud the pleasing scene,
  No vice degrades that purest soul serene.
  On the same day, our studious race begun,
  On the same day, our studious race was run;
  Thus, side by side, we pass'd our first career,
  Thus, side by side, we strove for many a year:
  At last, concluded our scholastic life,
  We neither conquer'd in the classic strife:
  As Speakers,  each supports an equal name, 
  And crowds allow to both a partial fame:
  To soothe a youthful Rival's early pride,
  Though Cleon's candour would the palm divide,
  Yet Candour's self compels me now to own,
  Justice awards it to my Friend alone.

    Oh! Friends regretted, Scenes for ever dear,
  Remembrance hails you with her warmest tear!
  Drooping, she bends o'er pensive Fancy's urn,
  To trace the hours, which never can return;
  Yet, with the retrospection loves to dwell, 
  And soothe the sorrows of her last farewell!
  Yet greets the triumph of my boyish mind,
  As infant laurels round my head were twin'd;
  When PROBUS' praise repaid my lyric song,
  Or plac'd me higher in the studious throng;
  Or when my first harangue receiv'd applause, 
  His sage instruction the primeval cause,
  What gratitude, to him, my soul possest,
  While hope of dawning honours fill'd my breast! 
  For all my humble fame, to him alone,
  The praise is due, who made that fame my own.
  Oh! could I soar above these feeble lays,
  These young effusions of my early days,
  To him my Muse her noblest strain would give,
  The song might perish, but the theme might live.
  Yet, why for him the needless verse essay?
  His honour'd name requires no vain display:
  By every son of grateful IDA blest,
  It finds an echo in each youthful breast;
  A fame beyond the glories of the proud,
  Or all the plaudits of the venal crowd.

  IDA! not yet exhausted is the theme,
  Nor clos'd the progress of my youthful dream.
  How many a friend deserves the grateful strain!
  What scenes of childhood still unsung remain!
  Yet let me hush this echo of the past,
  This parting song, the dearest and the last;
  And brood in secret o'er those hours of joy,
  To me a silent and a sweet employ,
  While, future hope and fear alike unknown,
  I think with pleasure on the past alone;
  Yes, to the past alone, my heart confine,
  And chase the phantom of what once was mine.

  IDA! still o'er thy hills in joy preside,
  And proudly steer through Time's eventful tide:
  Still may thy blooming Sons thy name revere,
  Smile in thy bower, but quit thee with a tear;--
  That tear, perhaps, the fondest which will flow,
  O'er their last scene of happiness below:
  Tell me, ye hoary few, who glide along,
  The feeble Veterans of some former throng,
  Whose friends, like Autumn leaves by tempests whirl'd,
  Are swept for ever from this busy world;
  Revolve the fleeting moments of your youth,
  While Care has yet withheld her venom'd tooth;
  Say, if Remembrance days like these endears,
  Beyond the rapture of succeeding years?
  Say, can Ambition's fever'd dream bestow
  So sweet a balm to soothe your hours of woe?
  Can Treasures hoarded for some thankless Son,
  Can Royal Smiles, or Wreaths by slaughter won,
  Can Stars or Ermine, Man's maturer Toys,
  (For glittering baubles are not left to Boys,)
  Recall one scene so much belov'd to view,
  As those where Youth her garland twin'd for you?
  Ah, no! amid the gloomy calm of age
  You turn with faltering hand life's varied page,
  Peruse the record of your days on earth,
  Unsullied only where it marks your birth;
  Still, lingering, pause above each chequer'd leaf,
  And blot with Tears the sable lines of Grief;
  Where Passion o'er the theme her mantle threw,
  Or weeping Virtue sigh'd a faint adieu;
  But bless the scroll which fairer words adorn,
  Trac'd by the rosy finger of the Morn;
  When Friendship bow'd before the shrine of truth,
  And Love, without his pinion,  smil'd on Youth.

ANSWER TO A BEAUTIFUL POEM, WRITTEN BY MONTGOMERY,
  AUTHOR OF "THE WANDERER OF SWITZERLAND," ETC.,
    ENTITLED "THE COMMON LOT." 

1.

  Montgomery! true, the common lot
    Of mortals lies in Lethe's wave;
  Yet some shall never be forgot,
    Some shall exist beyond the grave.

2.

  "Unknown the region of his birth,"
    The hero  rolls the tide of war;
  Yet not unknown his martial worth,
    Which glares a meteor from afar.

3.

  His joy or grief, his weal or woe,
    Perchance may 'scape the page of fame;
  Yet nations, now unborn, will know
    The record of his deathless name.

4.

  The Patriot's and the Poet's frame
    Must share the common tomb of all:
  Their glory will not sleep the same;
    'That' will arise, though Empires fall.

5.

  The lustre of a Beauty's eye
    Assumes the ghastly stare of death;
  The fair, the brave, the good must die,
    And sink the yawning grave beneath.

6.

  Once more, the speaking eye revives,
    Still beaming through the lover's strain;
  For Petrarch's Laura still survives:
    She died, but ne'er will die again.

7.

  The rolling seasons pass away,
    And Time, untiring, waves his wing;
  Whilst honour's laurels ne'er decay,
    But bloom in fresh, unfading spring.

8.

  All, all must sleep in grim repose,
    Collected in the silent tomb;
  The old, the young, with friends and foes,
    Fest'ring alike in shrouds, consume.

9.

  The mouldering marble lasts its day,
    Yet falls at length an useless fane;
  To Ruin's ruthless fangs a prey,
    The wrecks of pillar'd Pride remain.

10.

  What, though the sculpture be destroy'd,
    From dark Oblivion meant to guard;
  A bright renown shall be enjoy'd,
    By those, whose virtues claim reward.

11.

  Then do not say the common lot
    Of all lies deep in Lethe's wave;
  Some few who ne'er will be forgot
    Shall burst the bondage of the grave.

LOVE'S LAST ADIEU.

1.

  The roses of Love glad the garden of life,
    Though nurtur'd 'mid weeds dropping pestilent dew,
  Till Time crops the leaves with unmerciful knife,
    Or prunes them for ever, in Love's last adieu!

2.

  In vain, with endearments, we soothe the sad heart,
    In vain do we vow for an age to be true;
  The chance of an hour may command us to part,
    Or Death disunite us, in Love's last adieu!

3.

  Still Hope, breathing peace, through the grief-swollen breast, 
    Will whisper, "Our meeting we yet may renew:"
  With this dream of deceit, half our sorrow's represt,
    Nor taste we the poison, of Love's last adieu!

4.

  Oh! mark you yon pair, in the sunshine of youth,
    Love twin'd round their childhood his flow'rs as they grew;
  They flourish awhile, in the season of truth,
    Till chill'd by the winter of Love's last adieu!

5.

  Sweet lady! why thus doth a tear steal its way,
    Down a cheek which outrivals thy bosom in hue?
  Yet why do I ask?--to distraction a prey,
    Thy reason has perish'd, with Love's last adieu!

6.

  Oh! who is yon Misanthrope, shunning mankind?
    From cities to caves of the forest he flew:
  There, raving, he howls his complaint to the wind;
    The mountains reverberate Love's last adieu!

7.

  Now Hate rules a heart which in Love's easy chains,
    Once Passion's tumultuous blandishments knew;
  Despair now inflames the dark tide of his veins,
    He ponders, in frenzy, on Love's last adieu!

8.

  How he envies the wretch, with a soul wrapt in steel!
    His pleasures are scarce, yet his troubles are few,
  Who laughs at the pang that he never can feel,
    And dreads not the anguish of Love's last adieu!

9.

  Youth flies, life decays, even hope is o'ercast;
    No more, with Love's former devotion, we sue:
  He spreads his young wing, he retires with the blast;
    The shroud of affection is Love's last adieu!

10.

  In this life of probation, for rapture divine,
    Astrea declares that some penance is due;
  From him, who has worshipp'd at Love's gentle shrine,
    The atonement is ample, in Love's last adieu!

11.

  Who kneels to the God, on his altar of light
    Must myrtle and cypress alternately strew:
  His myrtle, an emblem of purest delight,
    His cypress, the garland of Love's last adieu!

LINES. 
  ADDRESSED TO THE REV. J. T. BECHER, 
    ON HIS ADVISING THE AUTHOR TO MIX MORE WITH SOCIETY.

1.

  Dear BECHER, you tell me to mix with mankind;
    I cannot deny such a precept is wise;
  But retirement accords with the tone of my mind:
    I will not descend to a world I despise.

2.

  Did the Senate or Camp my exertions require,
    Ambition might prompt me, at once, to go forth;
  When Infancy's years of probation expire,
    Perchance, I may strive to distinguish my birth.

3.

  The fire, in the cavern of Etna, conceal'd,
    Still mantles unseen in its secret recess;
  At length, in a volume terrific, reveal'd,
    No torrent can quench it, no bounds can repress.

4.

  Oh! thus, the desire, in my bosom, for fame 
    Bids me live, but to hope for Posterity's praise.
  Could I soar with the Phoenix on pinions of flame,
    With him I would wish to expire in the blaze.

5.

  For the life of a Fox, of a Chatham the death,
    What censure, what danger, what woe would I brave!
  Their lives did not end, when they yielded their breath,
    Their glory illumines the gloom of their grave.

6.

  Yet why should I mingle in Fashion's full herd?
    Why crouch to her leaders, or cringe to her rules?
  Why bend to the proud, or applaud the absurd?
    Why search for delight, in the friendship of fools?

7.

  I have tasted the sweets, and the bitters, of love,
    In friendship I early was taught to believe;
  My passion the matrons of prudence reprove,
    I have found that a friend may profess, yet deceive.

8.

  To me what is wealth?--it may pass in an hour,
    If Tyrants prevail, or if Fortune should frown:
  To me what is title?--the phantom of power;
    To me what is fashion?--I seek but renown.

9.

  Deceit is a stranger, as yet, to my soul;
    I, still, am unpractised to varnish the truth:
  Then, why should I live in a hateful controul?
    Why waste, upon folly, the days of my youth?

ANSWER TO SOME ELEGANT VERSES SENT BY A FRIEND TO THE AUTHOR,
  COMPLAINING THAT ONE OF HIS DESCRIPTIONS
    WAS RATHER TOO WARMLY DRAWN.

    "But if any old Lady, Knight, Priest, or Physician,
     Should condemn me for printing a second edition;
     If good Madam Squintum my work should abuse,
     May I venture to give her a smack of my muse?"

     Anstey's 'New Bath Guide', p. 169.

  Candour compels me, BECHER! to commend
  The verse, which blends the censor with the friend;
  Your strong yet just reproof extorts applause
  From me, the heedless and imprudent cause; 
  For this wild error, which pervades my strain, 
  I sue for pardon,--must I sue in vain?
  The wise sometimes from Wisdom's ways depart;
  Can youth then hush the dictates of the heart?
  Precepts of prudence curb, but can't controul,
  The fierce emotions of the flowing soul.
  When Love's delirium haunts the glowing mind,
  Limping Decorum lingers far behind;
  Vainly the dotard mends her prudish pace,
  Outstript and vanquish'd in the mental chase.
  The young, the old, have worn the chains of love;
  Let those, they ne'er confined, my lay reprove;
  Let those, whose souls contemn the pleasing power,
  Their censures on the hapless victim shower.
  Oh! how I hate the nerveless, frigid song,
  The ceaseless echo of the rhyming throng,
  Whose labour'd lines, in chilling numbers flow,
  To paint a pang the author ne'er can know!
  The artless Helicon, I boast, is youth;--
  My Lyre, the Heart--my Muse, the simple Truth.
  Far be't from me the "virgin's mind" to "taint:"
  Seduction's dread is here no slight restraint:
  The maid whose virgin breast is void of guile,
  Whose wishes dimple in a modest smile,
  Whose downcast eye disdains the wanton leer,
  Firm in her virtue's strength, yet not severe;
  She, whom a conscious grace shall thus refine,
  Will ne'er be "tainted" by a strain of mine.
  But, for the nymph whose premature desires
  Torment her bosom with unholy fires,
  No net to snare her willing heart is spread;
  She would have fallen, though she ne'er had read.
  For me, I fain would please the chosen few,
  Whose souls, to feeling and to nature true,
  Will spare the childish verse, and not destroy
  The light effusions of a heedless boy. 
  I seek not glory from the senseless crowd;
  Of fancied laurels, I shall ne'er be proud;
  Their warmest plaudits I would scarcely prize,
  Their sneers or censures, I alike despise.

ELEGY ON NEWSTEAD ABBEY. 

    "It is the voice of years, that are gone! they roll before me, with
    all their deeds."

    Ossian. 

1.

  NEWSTEAD! fast-falling, once-resplendent dome!
  Religion's shrine! repentant HENRY'S  pride!
  Of Warriors, Monks, and Dames the cloister'd tomb,
   Whose pensive shades around thy ruins glide,

2.

  Hail to thy pile! more honour'd in thy fall,
    Than modern mansions, in their pillar'd state;
  Proudly majestic frowns thy vaulted hall,
    Scowling defiance on the blasts of fate.

3.

  No mail-clad Serfs,  obedient to their Lord,
    In grim array, the crimson cross  demand;
  Or gay assemble round the festive board,
    Their chief's retainers, an immortal band.

4.

  Else might inspiring Fancy's magic eye
    Retrace their progress, through the lapse of time;
  Marking each ardent youth, ordain'd to die,
    A votive pilgrim, in Judea's clime.

5.

  But not from thee, dark pile! departs the Chief;
    His feudal realm in other regions lay:
  In thee the wounded conscience courts relief,
    Retiring from the garish blaze of day.

6.

  Yes! in thy gloomy cells and shades profound,
    The monk abjur'd a world, he ne'er could view;
  Or blood-stain'd Guilt repenting, solace found,
    Or Innocence, from stern Oppression, flew.

7.

  A Monarch bade thee from that wild arise,
    Where Sherwood's outlaws, once, were wont to prowl;
  And Superstition's crimes, of various dyes,
    Sought shelter in the Priest's protecting cowl.

8.

  Where, now, the grass exhales a murky dew,
    The humid pall of life-extinguish'd clay,
  In sainted fame, the sacred Fathers grew,
    Nor raised their pious voices, but to pray.

9.

  Where, now, the bats their wavering wings extend,
    Soon as the gloaming  spreads her waning shade;
  The choir did, oft, their mingling vespers blend,
    Or matin orisons to Mary  paid.

10.

  Years roll on years; to ages, ages yield;
    Abbots to Abbots, in a line, succeed:
  Religion's charter, their protecting shield,
    Till royal sacrilege their doom decreed.

11.

  One holy HENRY rear'd the Gothic walls,
    And bade the pious inmates rest in peace;
  Another HENRY  the kind gift recalls,
    And bids devotion's hallow'd echoes cease.

12.

  Vain is each threat, or supplicating prayer;
    He drives them exiles from their blest abode,
  To roam a dreary world, in deep despair--
    No friend, no home, no refuge, but their God. 

13.

  Hark! how the hall, resounding to the strain,
    Shakes with the martial music's novel din!
  The heralds of a warrior's haughty reign,
    High crested banners wave thy walls within.

14.

  Of changing sentinels the distant hum,
    The mirth of feasts, the clang of burnish'd arms,
  The braying trumpet, and the hoarser drum,
    Unite in concert with increas'd alarms.

15.

  An abbey once, a regal fortress  now,
    Encircled by insulting rebel powers;
  War's dread machines o'erhang thy threat'ning brow,
    And dart destruction, in sulphureous showers.

16.

  Ah! vain defence! the hostile traitor's siege,
    Though oft repuls'd, by guile o'ercomes the brave;
  His thronging foes oppress the faithful Liege,
    Rebellion's reeking standards o'er him wave.

17.

  Not unaveng'd the raging Baron yields;
    The blood of traitors smears the purple plain;
  Unconquer'd still, his falchion there he wields,
    And days of glory, yet, for him remain.

18.

  Still, in that hour, the warrior wish'd to strew
    Self-gather'd laurels on a self-sought grave;
  But Charles' protecting genius hither flew,
    The monarch's friend, the monarch's hope, to save.

19.

  Trembling, she snatch'd him  from th' unequal strife,
    In other fields the torrent to repel;
  For nobler combats, here, reserv'd his life,
    To lead the band, where godlike FALKLAND  fell.

20.

  From thee, poor pile! to lawless plunder given,
    While dying groans their painful requiem sound,
  Far different incense, now, ascends to Heaven,
    Such victims wallow on the gory ground.

21.

  There many a pale and ruthless Robber's corse,
    Noisome and ghast, defiles thy sacred sod;
  O'er mingling man, and horse commix'd with horse,
    Corruption's heap, the savage spoilers trod.

22.

  Graves, long with rank and sighing weeds o'erspread,
    Ransack'd resign, perforce, their mortal mould:
  From ruffian fangs, escape not e'en the dead,
    Racked from repose, in search for buried gold.

23.

  Hush'd is the harp, unstrung the warlike lyre,
    The minstrel's palsied hand reclines in death;
  No more he strikes the quivering chords with fire,
    Or sings the glories of the martial wreath. 

24.

  At length the sated murderers, gorged with prey,
    Retire: the clamour of the fight is o'er;
  Silence again resumes her awful sway,
    And sable Horror guards the massy door.

25.

  Here, Desolation holds her dreary court:
    What satellites declare her dismal reign!
  Shrieking their dirge, ill-omen'd birds resort,
    To flit their vigils, in the hoary fane.

26.

  Soon a new Morn's restoring beams dispel
    The clouds of Anarchy from Britain's skies;
  The fierce Usurper seeks his native hell,
    And Nature triumphs, as the Tyrant dies.

27.

  With storms she welcomes his expiring groans;
    Whirlwinds, responsive, greet his labouring breath;
  Earth shudders, as her caves receive his bones,
    Loathing  the offering of so dark a death.

28.

  The legal Ruler  now resumes the helm,
    He guides through gentle seas, the prow of state;
  Hope cheers, with wonted smiles, the peaceful realm,
    And heals the bleeding wounds of wearied Hate.

29.

  The gloomy tenants, Newstead! of thy cells,
    Howling, resign their violated nest; 
  Again, the Master on his tenure dwells,
    Enjoy'd, from absence, with enraptured zest.

30.

  Vassals, within thy hospitable pale,
    Loudly carousing, bless their Lord's return;
  Culture, again, adorns the gladdening vale,
    And matrons, once lamenting, cease to mourn.

31.

  A thousand songs, on tuneful echo, float,
    Unwonted foliage mantles o'er the trees;
  And, hark! the horns proclaim a mellow note,
    The hunters' cry hangs lengthening on the breeze.

32.

  Beneath their coursers' hoofs the valleys shake;
    What fears! what anxious hopes! attend the chase!
  The dying stag seeks refuge in the lake;
    Exulting shouts announce the finish'd race.

33.

  Ah happy days! too happy to endure!
    Such simple sports our plain forefathers knew:
  No splendid vices glitter'd to allure;
    Their joys were many, as their cares were few.

34.

  From these descending, Sons to Sires succeed;
    Time steals along, and Death uprears his dart;
  Another Chief impels the foaming steed,
    Another Crowd pursue the panting hart.

35.

  Newstead! what saddening change of scene is thine!
    Thy yawning arch betokens slow decay;
  The last and youngest of a noble line,
    Now holds thy mouldering turrets in his sway.

36.

  Deserted now, he scans thy gray worn towers;
    Thy vaults, where dead of feudal ages sleep;
  Thy cloisters, pervious to the wintry showers;
    These, these he views, and views them but to weep.

37.

  Yet are his tears no emblem of regret:
    Cherish'd Affection only bids them flow;
  Pride, Hope, and Love, forbid him to forget,
    But warm his bosom, with impassion'd glow.

38.

  Yet he prefers thee, to the gilded domes, 
    Or gewgaw grottos, of the vainly great;
  Yet lingers 'mid thy damp and mossy tombs,
    Nor breathes a murmur 'gainst the will of Fate.

39.

  Haply thy sun, emerging, yet, may shine,
    Thee to irradiate with meridian ray;
  Hours, splendid as the past, may still be thine,
    And bless thy future, as thy former day. 

HOURS OF IDLENESS

TO GEORGE, EARL DELAWARR. 

1.

  Oh! yes, I will own we were dear to each other;
    The friendships of childhood, though fleeting, are true;
  The love which you felt was the love of a brother,
    Nor less the affection I cherish'd for you.

2.

  But Friendship can vary her gentle dominion;
    The attachment of years, in a moment expires:
  Like Love, too, she moves on a swift-waving pinion,
    But glows not, like Love, with unquenchable fires.

3.

  Full oft have we wander'd through Ida together,
    And blest were the scenes of our youth, I allow:
  In the spring of our life, how serene is the weather!
    But Winter's rude tempests are gathering now.

4.

  No more with Affection shall Memory blending,
    The wonted delights of our childhood retrace:
  When Pride steels the bosom, the heart is unbending,
    And what would be Justice appears a disgrace.

5.

  However, dear George, for I still must esteem you--
    The few, whom I love, I can never upbraid;
  The chance, which has lost, may in future redeem you,
    Repentance will cancel the vow you have made.

6.

  I will not complain, and though chill'd is affection,
    With me no corroding resentment shall live:
  My bosom is calm'd by the simple reflection,
    That both may be wrong, and that both should forgive.

7.

  You knew, that my soul, that my heart, my existence,
    If danger demanded, were wholly your own;
  You knew me unalter'd, by years or by distance,
    Devoted to love and to friendship alone.

8.

  You knew,--but away with the vain retrospection!
    The bond of affection no longer endures;
  Too late you may droop o'er the fond recollection,
    And sigh for the friend, who was formerly yours.

9.

  For the present, we part,--I will hope not for ever; 
    For time and regret will restore you at last:
  To forget our dissension we both should endeavour,
    I ask no atonement, but days like the past.

DAMAETAS. 

  In law an infant,  and in years a boy,
  In mind a slave to every vicious joy;
  From every sense of shame and virtue wean'd,
  In lies an adept, in deceit a fiend;
  Vers'd in hypocrisy, while yet a child;
  Fickle as wind, of inclinations wild;
  Woman his dupe, his heedless friend a tool;
  Old in the world, though scarcely broke from school;
  Damaetas ran through all the maze of sin,
  And found the goal, when others just begin:
  Ev'n still conflicting passions shake his soul,
  And bid him drain the dregs of Pleasure's bowl;
  But, pall'd with vice, he breaks his former chain,
  And what was once his bliss appears his bane.

TO MARION. 

  MARION! why that pensive brow? 
  What disgust to life hast thou?
  Change that discontented air;
  Frowns become not one so fair.
  'Tis not Love disturbs thy rest,
  Love's a stranger to thy breast:
  He, in dimpling smiles, appears,
  Or mourns in sweetly timid tears;
  Or bends the languid eyelid down,
  But shuns the cold forbidding 'frown'.
  Then resume thy former fire,
  Some will love, and all admire!
  While that icy aspect chills us,
  Nought but cool Indiff'rence thrills us.
  Would'st thou wand'ring hearts beguile,
  Smile, at least, or seem to smile;
  Eyes like thine were never meant
  To hide their orbs in dark restraint;
  Spite of all thou fain wouldst say,
  Still in truant beams they play.
  Thy lips--but here my modest Muse
  Her impulse chaste must needs refuse:
  She blushes, curtsies, frowns,--in short She
  Dreads lest the Subject should transport me;
  And flying off, in search of Reason,
  Brings Prudence back in proper season.
  All I shall, therefore, say (whate'er 
  I think, is neither here nor there,)
  Is, that such lips, of looks endearing,
  Were form'd for better things than sneering.
  Of soothing compliments divested,
  Advice at least's disinterested;
  Such is my artless song to thee,
  From all the flow of Flatt'ry free;
  Counsel like mine is as a brother's,
  My heart is given to some others;
  That is to say, unskill'd to cozen,
  It shares itself among a dozen.

    Marion, adieu! oh, pr'ythee slight not
  This warning, though it may delight not;
  And, lest my precepts be displeasing, 
  To those who think remonstrance teazing,
  At once I'll tell thee our opinion,
  Concerning Woman's soft Dominion:
  Howe'er we gaze, with admiration,
  On eyes of blue or lips carnation;
  Howe'er the flowing locks attract us,
  Howe'er those beauties may distract us;
  Still fickle, we are prone to rove,
  These cannot fix our souls to love;
  It is not too severe a stricture,
  To say they form a pretty picture;
  But would'st thou see the secret chain,
  Which binds us in your humble train,
  To hail you Queens of all Creation,
  Know, in a word, 'tis Animation.

OSCAR OF ALVA. 

1.

  How sweetly shines, through azure skies,
    The lamp of Heaven on Lora's shore;
  Where Alva's hoary turrets rise,
    And hear the din of arms no more!

2.

  But often has yon rolling moon,
    On Alva's casques of silver play'd;
  And view'd, at midnight's silent noon,
    Her chiefs in gleaming mail array'd:

3.

  And, on the crimson'd rocks beneath,
    Which scowl o'er ocean's sullen flow,
  Pale in the scatter'd ranks of death,
    She saw the gasping warrior low; 

4.

  While many an eye, which ne'er again 
    Could mark the rising orb of day,
  Turn'd feebly from the gory plain,
    Beheld in death her fading ray.

5.

  Once, to those eyes the lamp of Love,
    They blest her dear propitious light;
  But, now, she glimmer'd from above,
    A sad, funereal torch of night.

6.

  Faded is Alva's noble race,
    And grey her towers are seen afar;
  No more her heroes urge the chase,
    Or roll the crimson tide of war.

7.

  But, who was last of Alva's clan?
    Why grows the moss on Alva's stone?
  Her towers resound no steps of man,
    They echo to the gale alone.

8.

  And, when that gale is fierce and high,
    A sound is heard in yonder hall;
  It rises hoarsely through the sky,
    And vibrates o'er the mould'ring wall.

9.

  Yes, when the eddying tempest sighs,
    It shakes the shield of Oscar brave;
  But, there, no more his banners rise,
    No more his plumes of sable wave.

10.

  Fair shone the sun on Oscar's birth,
    When Angus hail'd his eldest born;
  The vassals round their chieftain's hearth
    Crowd to applaud the happy morn.

11.

  They feast upon the mountain deer,
    The Pibroch rais'd its piercing note, 
  To gladden more their Highland cheer,
    The strains in martial numbers float.

12.

  And they who heard the war-notes wild,
    Hop'd that, one day, the Pibroch's strain
  Should play before the Hero's child,
    While he should lead the Tartan train.

13.

  Another year is quickly past,
    And Angus hails another son;
  His natal day is like the last,
    Nor soon the jocund feast was done.

14.

  Taught by their sire to bend the bow,
    On Alva's dusky hills of wind,
  The boys in childhood chas'd the roe,
    And left their hounds in speed behind.

15.

  But ere their years of youth are o'er,
    They mingle in the ranks of war;
  They lightly wheel the bright claymore,
    And send the whistling arrow far.

16.

  Dark was the flow of Oscar's hair,
    Wildly it stream'd along the gale;
  But Allan's locks were bright and fair,
    And pensive seem'd his cheek, and pale.

17.

  But Oscar own'd a hero's soul,
    His dark eye shone through beams of truth;
  Allan had early learn'd controul,
    And smooth his words had been from youth.

18.

  Both, both were brave; the Saxon spear
    Was shiver'd oft beneath their steel;
  And Oscar's bosom scorn'd to fear,
    But Oscar's bosom knew to feel;

19.

  While Allan's soul belied his form,
    Unworthy with such charms to dwell:
  Keen as the lightning of the storm,
    On foes his deadly vengeance fell.

20.

  From high Southannon's distant tower
    Arrived a young and noble dame;
  With Kenneth's lands to form her dower,
    Glenalvon's blue-eyed daughter came;

21.

  And Oscar claim'd the beauteous bride,
    And Angus on his Oscar smil'd:
  It soothed the father's feudal pride
    Thus to obtain Glenalvon's child.

22.

  Hark! to the Pibroch's pleasing note,
    Hark! to the swelling nuptial song,
  In joyous strains the voices float,
    And, still, the choral peal prolong.

23.

  See how the Heroes' blood-red plumes
    Assembled wave in Alva's hall;
  Each youth his varied plaid assumes,
    Attending on their chieftain's call.

24.

  It is not war their aid demands,
    The Pibroch plays the song of peace;
  To Oscar's nuptials throng the bands
    Nor yet the sounds of pleasure cease.

25.

  But where is Oscar? sure 'tis late:
    Is this a bridegroom's ardent flame?
  While thronging guests and ladies wait,
    Nor Oscar nor his brother came.

26.

  At length young Allan join'd the bride;
    "Why comes not Oscar?" Angus said:
  "Is he not here?" the Youth replied;
    "With me he rov'd not o'er the glade:

27.

  "Perchance, forgetful of the day,
    'Tis his to chase the bounding roe;
  Or Ocean's waves prolong his stay:
    Yet, Oscar's bark is seldom slow."

28.

  "Oh, no!" the anguish'd Sire rejoin'd,
    "Nor chase, nor wave, my Boy delay;
  Would he to Mora seem unkind?
    Would aught to her impede his way?

29.

  "Oh, search, ye Chiefs! oh, search around!
    Allan, with these, through Alva fly;
  Till Oscar, till my son is found,
    Haste, haste, nor dare attempt reply."

30.

  All is confusion--through the vale,
    The name of Oscar hoarsely rings,
  It rises on the murm'ring gale,
    Till night expands her dusky wings.

31.

  It breaks the stillness of the night,
    But echoes through her shades in vain;
  It sounds through morning's misty light,
    But Oscar comes not o'er the plain.

32.

  Three days, three sleepless nights, the Chief
    For Oscar search'd each mountain cave;
  Then hope is lost; in boundless grief,
    His locks in grey-torn ringlets wave.

33.

  "Oscar! my son!--thou God of Heav'n,
    Restore the prop of sinking age!
  Or, if that hope no more is given,
    Yield his assassin to my rage.

34.

  "Yes, on some desert rocky shore
    My Oscar's whiten'd bones must lie;
  Then grant, thou God! I ask no more,
    With him his frantic Sire may die!

35.

  "Yet, he may live,--away, despair!
    Be calm, my soul! he yet may live;
  T' arraign my fate, my voice forbear!
    O God! my impious prayer forgive.

36.

  "What, if he live for me no more,
    I sink forgotten in the dust,
  The hope of Alva's age is o'er:
    Alas! can pangs like these be just?"

37.

  Thus did the hapless Parent mourn,
    Till Time, who soothes severest woe,
  Had bade serenity return,
    And made the tear-drop cease to flow.

38.

  For, still, some latent hope surviv'd
    That Oscar might once more appear;
  His hope now droop'd and now revived,
    Till Time had told a tedious year.

39.

  Days roll'd along, the orb of light
    Again had run his destined race;
  No Oscar bless'd his father's sight,
    And sorrow left a fainter trace.

40.

  For youthful Allan still remain'd,
    And, now, his father's only joy:
  And Mora's heart was quickly gain'd,
    For beauty crown'd the fair-hair'd boy.

41.

  She thought that Oscar low was laid,
    And Allan's face was wondrous fair;
  If Oscar liv'd, some other maid
    Had claim'd his faithless bosom's care.

42.

  And Angus said, if one year more
    In fruitless hope was pass'd away,
  His fondest scruples should be o'er,
    And he would name their nuptial day.

43.

  Slow roll'd the moons, but blest at last
    Arriv'd the dearly destin'd morn:
  The year of anxious trembling past,
    What smiles the lovers' cheeks adorn!

44.

  Hark to the Pibroch's pleasing note!
    Hark to the swelling nuptial song!
  In joyous strains the voices float,
    And, still, the choral peal prolong.

45.

  Again the clan, in festive crowd,
    Throng through the gate of Alva's hall;
  The sounds of mirth re-echo loud,
    And all their former joy recall.

46.

  But who is he, whose darken'd brow
    Glooms in the midst of general mirth?
  Before his eyes' far fiercer glow
    The blue flames curdle o'er the hearth.

47.

  Dark is the robe which wraps his form,
    And tall his plume of gory red;
  His voice is like the rising storm,
    But light and trackless is his tread.

48.

  'Tis noon of night, the pledge goes round,
    The bridegroom's health is deeply quaff'd;
  With shouts the vaulted roofs resound,
    And all combine to hail the draught.

49.

  Sudden the stranger-chief arose,
    And all the clamorous crowd are hush'd;
  And Angus' cheek with wonder glows,
    And Mora's tender bosom blush'd.

50.

  "Old man!" he cried, "this pledge is done,
    Thou saw'st 'twas truly drunk by me;
  It hail'd the nuptials of thy son:
    Now will I claim a pledge from thee.

51.

  "While all around is mirth and joy,
    To bless thy Allan's happy lot,
  Say, hadst thou ne'er another boy?
    Say, why should Oscar be forgot?"

52.

  "Alas!" the hapless Sire replied,
    The big tear starting as he spoke,
  "When Oscar left my hall, or died,
    This aged heart was almost broke.

53.

  "Thrice has the earth revolv'd her course
    Since Oscar's form has bless'd my sight;
  And Allan is my last resource,
    Since martial Oscar's death, or flight."

54.

  "'Tis well," replied the stranger stern,
    And fiercely flash'd his rolling eye;
  "Thy Oscar's fate, I fain would learn;
    Perhaps the Hero did not die.

55.

  "Perchance, if those, whom most he lov'd,
    Would call, thy Oscar might return;
  Perchance, the chief has only rov'd;
    For him thy Beltane, yet, may burn. 

56.

  "Fill high the bowl the table round,
    We will not claim the pledge by stealth;
  With wine let every cup be crown'd;
    Pledge me departed Oscar's health."

57.

  "With all my soul," old Angus said,
    And fill'd his goblet to the brim:
  "Here's to my boy! alive or dead,
    I ne'er shall find a son like him."

58.

  "Bravely, old man, this health has sped;
    But why does Allan trembling stand?
  Come, drink remembrance of the dead,
    And raise thy cup with firmer hand."

59.

  The crimson glow of Allan's face
    Was turn'd at once to ghastly hue;
  The drops of death each other chace,
    Adown in agonizing dew.

60.

  Thrice did he raise the goblet high,
    And thrice his lips refused to taste;
  For thrice he caught the stranger's eye
    On his with deadly fury plac'd.

61.

  "And is it thus a brother hails
    A brother's fond remembrance here?
  If thus affection's strength prevails,
    What might we not expect from fear?"

62.

  Roused by the sneer, he rais'd the bowl,
    "Would Oscar now could share our mirth!"
  Internal fear appall'd his soul; 
    He said, and dash'd the cup to earth.

63.

  "'Tis he! I hear my murderer's voice!"
    Loud shrieks a darkly gleaming Form.
  "A murderer's voice!" the roof replies,
    And deeply swells the bursting storm.

64.

  The tapers wink, the chieftains shrink,
    The stranger's gone,--amidst the crew,
  A Form was seen, in tartan green,
    And tall the shade terrific grew.

65.

  His waist was bound with a broad belt round,
    His plume of sable stream'd on high;
  But his breast was bare, with the red wounds there,
    And fix'd was the glare of his glassy eye.

66.

  And thrice he smil'd, with his eye so wild
    On Angus bending low the knee;
  And thrice he frown'd, on a Chief on the ground,
    Whom shivering crowds with horror see.

67.

  The bolts loud roll from pole to pole,
    And thunders through the welkin ring,
  And the gleaming form, through the mist of the storm,
    Was borne on high by the whirlwind's wing.

68.

  Cold was the feast, the revel ceas'd.
    Who lies upon the stony floor?
  Oblivion press'd old Angus' breast, 
    At length his life-pulse throbs once more.

69.

  "Away, away! let the leech essay
    To pour the light on Allan's eyes:"
  His sand is done,--his race is run;
    Oh! never more shall Allan rise!

70.

  But Oscar's breast is cold as clay,
    His locks are lifted by the gale;
  And Allan's barbed arrow lay
    With him in dark Glentanar's vale.

71.

  And whence the dreadful stranger came,
    Or who, no mortal wight can tell;
  But no one doubts the form of flame,
    For Alva's sons knew Oscar well.

72.

  Ambition nerv'd young Allan's hand,
    Exulting demons wing'd his dart;
  While Envy wav'd her burning brand,
    And pour'd her venom round his heart.

73.

  Swift is the shaft from Allan's bow;
    Whose streaming life-blood stains his side?
  Dark Oscar's sable crest is low,
    The dart has drunk his vital tide.

74.

  And Mora's eye could Allan move,
    She bade his wounded pride rebel:
  Alas! that eyes, which beam'd with love,
    Should urge the soul to deeds of Hell.

75.

  Lo! see'st thou not a lonely tomb,
    Which rises o'er a warrior dead?
  It glimmers through the twilight gloom;
    Oh! that is Allan's nuptial bed.

76.

  Far, distant far, the noble grave
    Which held his clan's great ashes stood;
  And o'er his corse no banners wave,
    For they were stain'd with kindred blood.

77.

  What minstrel grey, what hoary bard,
    Shall Allan's deeds on harp-strings raise?
  The song is glory's chief reward,
    But who can strike a murd'rer's praise?

78.

  Unstrung, untouch'd, the harp must stand,
    No minstrel dare the theme awake;
  Guilt would benumb his palsied hand,
    His harp in shuddering chords would break.

79.

  No lyre of fame, no hallow'd verse,
    Shall sound his glories high in air:
  A dying father's bitter curse,
    A brother's death-groan echoes there.

TRANSLATION FROM ANACREON.

ODE 1.

TO HIS LYRE.

  I wish to tune my quivering lyre, 
  To deeds of fame, and notes of fire;
  To echo, from its rising swell,
  How heroes fought and nations fell,
  When Atreus' sons advanc'd to war,
  Or Tyrian Cadmus rov'd afar;
  But still, to martial strains unknown,
  My lyre recurs to Love alone.
  Fir'd with the hope of future fame, 
  I seek some nobler Hero's name;
  The dying chords are strung anew,
  To war, to war, my harp is due:
  With glowing strings, the Epic strain
  To Jove's great son I raise again;
  Alcides and his glorious deeds,
  Beneath whose arm the Hydra bleeds;
  All, all in vain; my wayward lyre
  Wakes silver notes of soft Desire.
  Adieu, ye Chiefs renown'd in arms!
  Adieu the clang of War's alarms! 
  To other deeds my soul is strung,
  And sweeter notes shall now be sung;
  My harp shall all its powers reveal,
  To tell the tale my heart must feel;
  Love, Love alone, my lyre shall claim,
  In songs of bliss and sighs of flame.

FROM ANACREON.

ODE 3.

  'Twas now the hour when Night had driven
  Her car half round yon sable heaven;
  Boates, only, seem'd to roll 
  His Arctic charge around the Pole;
  While mortals, lost in gentle sleep,
  Forgot to smile, or ceas'd to weep:
  At this lone hour the Paphian boy,
  Descending from the realms of joy,
  Quick to my gate directs his course,
  And knocks with all his little force;
  My visions fled, alarm'd I rose,--
  "What stranger breaks my blest repose?"
  "Alas!" replies the wily child
  In faltering accents sweetly mild;
  "A hapless Infant here I roam,
  Far from my dear maternal home.
  Oh! shield me from the wintry blast!
  The nightly storm is pouring fast.
  No prowling robber lingers here;
  A wandering baby who can fear?"
  I heard his seeming artless tale, 
  I heard his sighs upon the gale:
  My breast was never pity's foe,
  But felt for all the baby's woe.
  I drew the bar, and by the light
  Young Love, the infant, met my sight;
  His bow across his shoulders flung,
  And thence his fatal quiver hung
  (Ah! little did I think the dart
  Would rankle soon within my heart).
  With care I tend my weary guest,
  His little fingers chill my breast;
  His glossy curls, his azure wing,
  Which droop with nightly showers, I wring;
  His shivering limbs the embers warm;
  And now reviving from the storm,
  Scarce had he felt his wonted glow,
  Than swift he seized his slender bow:--
  "I fain would know, my gentle host,"
  He cried, "if this its strength has lost;
  I fear, relax'd with midnight dews,
  The strings their former aid refuse."
  With poison tipt, his arrow flies,
  Deep in my tortur'd heart it lies:
  Then loud the joyous Urchin laugh'd:--
  "My bow can still impel the shaft:
  'Tis firmly fix'd, thy sighs reveal it;
  Say, courteous host, canst thou not feel it?"

THE EPISODE OF NISUS AND EURYALUS. 

A PARAPHRASE FROM THE "AENEID," LIB. 9.

  Nisus, the guardian of the portal, stood,
  Eager to gild his arms with hostile blood;
  Well skill'd, in fight, the quivering lance to wield,
  Or pour his arrows thro' th' embattled field:
  From Ida torn, he left his sylvan cave, 
  And sought a foreign home, a distant grave.
  To watch the movements of the Daunian host,
  With him Euryalus sustains the post;
  No lovelier mien adorn'd the ranks of Troy,
  And beardless bloom yet grac'd the gallant boy;
  Though few the seasons of his youthful life,
  As yet a novice in the martial strife,
  'Twas his, with beauty, Valour's gifts to share--
  A soul heroic, as his form was fair:
  These burn with one pure flame of generous love;
  In peace, in war, united still they move;
  Friendship and Glory form their joint reward;
  And, now, combin'd they hold their nightly guard. 

  "What God," exclaim'd the first, "instils this fire?
  Or, in itself a God, what great desire?
  My lab'ring soul, with anxious thought oppress'd,
  Abhors this station of inglorious rest;
  The love of fame with this can ill accord,
  Be't mine to seek for glory with my sword.
  See'st thou yon camp, with torches twinkling dim,
  Where drunken slumbers wrap each lazy limb?
  Where confidence and ease the watch disdain,
  And drowsy Silence holds her sable reign?
  Then hear my thought:--In deep and sullen grief
  Our troops and leaders mourn their absent chief:
  Now could the gifts and promised prize be thine,
  (The deed, the danger, and the fame be mine,)
  Were this decreed, beneath yon rising mound,
  Methinks, an easy path, perchance, were found;
  Which past, I speed my way to Pallas' walls,
  And lead Aeneas from Evander's halls."

    With equal ardour fir'd, and warlike joy,
  His glowing friend address'd the Dardan boy:--
  "These deeds, my Nisus, shalt thou dare alone?
  Must all the fame, the peril, be thine own?
  Am I by thee despis'd, and left afar,
  As one unfit to share the toils of war?
  Not thus his son the great Opheltes taught:
  Not thus my sire in Argive combats fought;
  Not thus, when Ilion fell by heavenly hate,
  I track'd Aeneas through the walks of fate:
  Thou know'st my deeds, my breast devoid of fear,
  And hostile life-drops dim my gory spear.
  Here is a soul with hope immortal burns,
  And life, ignoble life, for Glory spurns.
  Fame, fame is cheaply earn'd by fleeting breath:
  The price of honour, is the sleep of death."

    Then Nisus:--"Calm thy bosom's fond alarms: 
  Thy heart beats fiercely to the din of arms.
  More dear thy worth, and valour than my own,
  I swear by him, who fills Olympus' throne!
  So may I triumph, as I speak the truth,
  And clasp again the comrade of my youth!
  But should I fall,--and he, who dares advance
  Through hostile legions, must abide by chance,--
  If some Rutulian arm, with adverse blow,
  Should lay the friend, who ever lov'd thee, low,
  Live thou--such beauties I would fain preserve--
  Thy budding years a lengthen'd term deserve;
  When humbled in the dust, let some one be,
  Whose gentle eyes will shed one tear for me;
  Whose manly arm may snatch me back by force,
  Or wealth redeem, from foes, my captive corse;
  Or, if my destiny these last deny,
  If, in the spoiler's power, my ashes lie;
  Thy pious care may raise a simple tomb,
  To mark thy love, and signalise my doom.
  Why should thy doating wretched mother weep
  Her only boy, reclin'd in endless sleep?
  Who, for thy sake, the tempest's fury dar'd,
  Who, for thy sake, war's deadly peril shar'd;
  Who brav'd what woman never brav'd before,
  And left her native, for the Latian shore."

  "In vain you damp the ardour of my soul,"
  Replied Euryalus; "it scorns controul;
  Hence, let us haste!"--their brother guards arose,
  Rous'd by their call, nor court again repose;
  The pair, buoy'd up on Hope's exulting wing,
  Their stations leave, and speed to seek the king.

    Now, o'er the earth a solemn stillness ran,
  And lull'd alike the cares of brute and man;
  Save where the Dardan leaders, nightly, hold
  Alternate converse, and their plans unfold.
  On one great point the council are agreed,
  An instant message to their prince decreed;
  Each lean'd upon the lance he well could wield,
  And pois'd with easy arm his ancient shield;
  When Nisus and his friend their leave request,
  To offer something to their high behest.
  With anxious tremors, yet unaw'd by fear, 
  The faithful pair before the throne appear;
  Iulus greets them; at his kind command,
  The elder, first, address'd the hoary band.

  "With patience" (thus Hyrtacides began)
  "Attend, nor judge, from youth, our humble plan.
  Where yonder beacons half-expiring beam,
  Our slumbering foes of future conquest dream, 
  Nor heed that we a secret path have trac'd,
  Between the ocean and the portal plac'd;
  Beneath the covert of the blackening smoke,
  Whose shade, securely, our design will cloak!
  If you, ye Chiefs, and Fortune will allow,
  We'll bend our course to yonder mountain's brow,
  Where Pallas' walls, at distance, meet the sight,
  Seen o'er the glade, when not obscur'd by night:
  Then shall Aeneas in his pride return,
  While hostile matrons raise their offspring's urn;
  And Latian spoils, and purpled heaps of dead
  Shall mark the havoc of our Hero's tread;
  Such is our purpose, not unknown the way,
  Where yonder torrent's devious waters stray;
  Oft have we seen, when hunting by the stream,
  The distant spires above the valleys gleam."

    Mature in years, for sober wisdom fam'd,
  Mov'd by the speech, Alethes here exclaim'd,--
  "Ye parent gods! who rule the fate of Troy,
  Still dwells the Dardan spirit in the boy;
  When minds, like these, in striplings thus ye raise,
  Yours is the godlike act, be yours the praise;
  In gallant youth, my fainting hopes revive,
  And Ilion's wonted glories still survive."
  Then in his warm embrace the boys he press'd,
  And, quivering, strain'd them to his aged breast;
  With tears the burning cheek of each bedew'd,
  And, sobbing, thus his first discourse renew'd:--
  "What gift, my countrymen, what martial prize,
  Can we bestow, which you may not despise?
  Our Deities the first best boon have given--
  Internal virtues are the gift of Heaven.
  What poor rewards can bless your deeds on earth,
  Doubtless await such young, exalted worth;
  Aeneas and Ascanius shall combine
  To yield applause far, far surpassing mine."

    Iulus then:--"By all the powers above!
  By those Penates, who my country love!
  By hoary Vesta's sacred Fane, I swear,
  My hopes are all in you, ye generous pair!
  Restore my father, to my grateful sight,
  And all my sorrows, yield to one delight.
  Nisus! two silver goblets are thine own,
  Sav'd from Arisba's stately domes o'erthrown;
  My sire secured them on that fatal day,
  Nor left such bowls an Argive robber's prey.
  Two massy tripods, also, shall be thine,
  Two talents polish'd from the glittering mine;
  An ancient cup, which Tyrian Dido gave,
  While yet our vessels press'd the Punic wave:
  But when the hostile chiefs at length bow down,
  When great Aeneas wears Hesperia's crown,
  The casque, the buckler, and the fiery steed
  Which Turnus guides with more than mortal speed,
  Are thine; no envious lot shall then be cast,
  I pledge my word, irrevocably past:
  Nay more, twelve slaves, and twice six captive dames,
  To soothe thy softer hours with amorous flames,
  And all the realms, which now the Latins sway,
  The labours of to-night shall well repay.
  But thou, my generous youth, whose tender years
  Are near my own, whose worth my heart reveres,
  Henceforth, affection, sweetly thus begun,
  Shall join our bosoms and our souls in one;
  Without thy aid, no glory shall be mine,
  Without thy dear advice, no great design;
  Alike, through life, esteem'd, thou godlike boy,
  In war my bulwark, and in peace my joy."

    To him Euryalus:--"No day shall shame
  The rising glories which from this I claim.
  Fortune may favour, or the skies may frown,
  But valour, spite of fate, obtains renown.
  Yet, ere from hence our eager steps depart,
  One boon I beg, the nearest to my heart:
  My mother, sprung from Priam's royal line,
  Like thine ennobled, hardly less divine,
  Nor Troy nor king Acestes' realms restrain
  Her feeble age from dangers of the main;
  Alone she came, all selfish fears above, 
  A bright example of maternal love.
  Unknown, the secret enterprise I brave,
  Lest grief should bend my parent to the grave;
  From this alone no fond adieus I seek,
  No fainting mother's lips have press'd my cheek;
  By gloomy Night and thy right hand I vow,
  Her parting tears would shake my purpose now: 
  Do thou, my prince, her failing age sustain,
  In thee her much-lov'd child may live again;
  Her dying hours with pious conduct bless,
  Assist her wants, relieve her fond distress:
  So dear a hope must all my soul enflame, 
  To rise in glory, or to fall in fame."
  Struck with a filial care so deeply felt,
  In tears at once the Trojan warriors melt;
  Faster than all, Iulus' eyes o'erflow!
  Such love was his, and such had been his woe.
  "All thou hast ask'd, receive," the Prince replied;
  "Nor this alone, but many a gift beside.
  To cheer thy mother's years shall be my aim,
  Creusa's  style but wanting to the dame;
  Fortune an adverse wayward course may run,
  But bless'd thy mother in so dear a son.
  Now, by my life!--my Sire's most sacred oath--
  To thee I pledge my full, my firmest troth,
  All the rewards which once to thee were vow'd, 
  If thou should'st fall, on her shall be bestow'd."
  Thus spoke the weeping Prince, then forth to view
  A gleaming falchion from the sheath he drew;
  Lycaon's utmost skill had grac'd the steel,
  For friends to envy and for foes to feel:
  A tawny hide, the Moorish lion's spoil, 
  Slain 'midst the forest in the hunter's toil,
  Mnestheus to guard the elder youth bestows, 
  And old Alethes' casque defends his brows;
  Arm'd, thence they go, while all th' assembl'd train,
  To aid their cause, implore the gods in vain. 
  More than a boy, in wisdom and in grace,
  Iulus holds amidst the chiefs his place:
  His prayer he sends; but what can prayers avail,
  Lost in the murmurs of the sighing gale? 

    The trench is pass'd, and favour'd by the night,
  Through sleeping foes, they wheel their wary flight.
  When shall the sleep of many a foe be o'er?
  Alas! some slumber, who shall wake no more!
  Chariots and bridles, mix'd with arms, are seen,
  And flowing flasks, and scatter'd troops between:
  Bacchus and Mars, to rule the camp, combine;
  A mingled Chaos this of war and wine.
  "Now," cries the first, "for deeds of blood prepare,
  With me the conquest and the labour share:
  Here lies our path; lest any hand arise,
  Watch thou, while many a dreaming chieftain dies;
  I'll carve our passage, through the heedless foe,
  And clear thy road, with many a deadly blow."
  His whispering accents then the youth repress'd,
  And pierced proud Rhamnes through his panting breast:
  Stretch'd at his ease, th' incautious king repos'd;
  Debauch, and not fatigue, his eyes had clos'd;
  To Turnus dear, a prophet and a prince,
  His omens more than augur's skill evince;
  But he, who thus foretold the fate of all,
  Could not avert his own untimely fall.
  Next Remus' armour-bearer, hapless, fell,
  And three unhappy slaves the carnage swell;
  The charioteer along his courser's sides
  Expires, the steel his sever'd neck divides;
  And, last, his Lord is number'd with the dead:
  Bounding convulsive, flies the gasping head;
  From the swol'n veins the blackening torrents pour;
  Stain'd is the couch and earth with clotting gore.
  Young Lamyrus and Lamus next expire,
  And gay Serranus, fill'd with youthful fire;
  Half the long night in childish games was pass'd; 
  Lull'd by the potent grape, he slept at last:
  Ah! happier far, had he the morn survey'd,
  And, till Aurora's dawn, his skill display'd. 
  In slaughter'd folds, the keepers lost in sleep, 
  His hungry fangs a lion thus may steep;
  'Mid the sad flock, at dead of night he prowls,
  With murder glutted, and in carnage rolls
  Insatiate still, through teeming herds he roams; 
  In seas of gore, the lordly tyrant foams.

    Nor less the other's deadly vengeance came,
  But falls on feeble crowds without a name;
  His wound unconscious Fadus scarce can feel,
  Yet wakeful Rhaesus sees the threatening steel;
  His coward breast behind a jar he hides,
  And, vainly, in the weak defence confides;
  Full in his heart, the falchion search'd his veins,
  The reeking weapon bears alternate stains;
  Through wine and blood, commingling as they flow,
  One feeble spirit seeks the shades below.
  Now where Messapus dwelt they bend their way,
  Whose fires emit a faint and trembling ray;
  There, unconfin'd, behold each grazing steed,
  Unwatch'd, unheeded, on the herbage feed: 
  Brave Nisus here arrests his comrade's arm,
  Too flush'd with carnage, and with conquest warm:
  "Hence let us haste, the dangerous path is pass'd;
  Full foes enough, to-night, have breath'd their last:
  Soon will the Day those Eastern clouds adorn;
  Now let us speed, nor tempt the rising morn."

    What silver arms, with various art emboss'd,
  What bowls and mantles, in confusion toss'd,
  They leave regardless! yet one glittering prize
  Attracts the younger Hero's wandering eyes;
  The gilded harness Rhamnes' coursers felt,
  The gems which stud the monarch's golden belt:
  This from the pallid corse was quickly torn,
  Once by a line of former chieftains worn.
  Th' exulting boy the studded girdle wears,
  Messapus' helm his head, in triumph, bears;
  Then from the tents their cautious steps they bend,
  To seek the vale, where safer paths extend.

    Just at this hour, a band of Latian horse
  To Turnus' camp pursue their destin'd course:
  While the slow foot their tardy march delay,
  The knights, impatient, spur along the way:
  Three hundred mail-clad men, by Volscens led,
  To Turnus with their master's promise sped:
  Now they approach the trench, and view the walls,
  When, on the left, a light reflection falls;
  The plunder'd helmet, through the waning night,
  Sheds forth a silver radiance, glancing bright;
  Volscens, with question loud, the pair alarms:--
  "Stand, Stragglers! stand! why early thus in arms?
  From whence? to whom?"--He meets with no reply;
  Trusting the covert of the night, they fly:
  The thicket's depth, with hurried pace, they tread,
  While round the wood the hostile squadron spread.

    With brakes entangled, scarce a path between,
  Dreary and dark appears the sylvan scene:
  Euryalus his heavy spoils impede,
  The boughs and winding turns his steps mislead;
  But Nisus scours along the forest's maze,
  To where Latinus' steeds in safety graze,
  Then backward o'er the plain his eyes extend,
  On every side they seek his absent friend.
  "O God! my boy," he cries, "of me bereft, 
  In what impending perils art thou left!"
  Listening he runs--above the waving trees,
  Tumultuous voices swell the passing breeze;
  The war-cry rises, thundering hoofs around
  Wake the dark echoes of the trembling ground.
  Again he turns--of footsteps hears the noise--
  The sound elates--the sight his hope destroys:
  The hapless boy a ruffian train surround, 
  While lengthening shades his weary way confound;
  Him, with loud shouts, the furious knights pursue,
  Struggling in vain, a captive to the crew. 
  What can his friend 'gainst thronging numbers dare?
  Ah! must he rush, his comrade's fate to share?
  What force, what aid, what stratagem essay,
  Back to redeem the Latian spoiler's prey?
  His life a votive ransom nobly give,
  Or die with him, for whom he wish'd to live?
  Poising with strength his lifted lance on high,
  On Luna's orb he cast his frenzied eye:--

  "Goddess serene, transcending every star! 
  Queen of the sky, whose beams are seen afar!
  By night Heaven owns thy sway, by day the grove,
  When, as chaste Dian, here thou deign'st to rove;
  If e'er myself, or Sire, have sought to grace
  Thine altars, with the produce of the chase,
  Speed, speed my dart to pierce yon vaunting crowd,
  To free my friend, and scatter far the proud."
  Thus having said, the hissing dart he flung;
  Through parted shades the hurtling weapon sung;
  The thirsty point in Sulmo's entrails lay,
  Transfix'd his heart, and stretch'd him on the clay:
  He sobs, he dies,--the troop in wild amaze,
  Unconscious whence the death, with horror gaze;
  While pale they stare, thro' Tagus' temples riven,
  A second shaft, with equal force is driven:
  Fierce Volscens rolls around his lowering eyes;
  Veil'd by the night, secure the Trojan lies. 
  Burning with wrath, he view'd his soldiers fall.
  "Thou youth accurst, thy life shall pay for all!"
  Quick from the sheath his flaming glaive he drew,
  And, raging, on the boy defenceless flew.
  Nisus, no more the blackening shade conceals,
  Forth, forth he starts, and all his love reveals;
  Aghast, confus'd, his fears to madness rise,
  And pour these accents, shrieking as he flies;
  "Me, me,--your vengeance hurl on me alone;
  Here sheathe the steel, my blood is all your own;
  Ye starry Spheres! thou conscious Heaven! attest!
  He could not--durst not--lo! the guile confest!
  All, all was mine,--his early fate suspend;
  He only lov'd, too well, his hapless friend:
  Spare, spare, ye Chiefs! from him your rage remove;
  His fault was friendship, all his crime was love."
  He pray'd in vain; the dark assassin's sword
  Pierced the fair side, the snowy bosom gor'd;
  Lowly to earth inclines his plume-clad crest,
  And sanguine torrents mantle o'er his breast:
  As some young rose whose blossom scents the air,
  Languid in death, expires beneath the share;
  Or crimson poppy, sinking with the shower,
  Declining gently, falls a fading flower;
  Thus, sweetly drooping, bends his lovely head,
  And lingering Beauty hovers round the dead.

  But fiery Nisus stems the battle's tide,
  Revenge his leader, and Despair his guide; 
  Volscens he seeks amidst the gathering host,
  Volscens must soon appease his comrade's ghost;
  Steel, flashing, pours on steel, foe crowds on foe;
  Rage nerves his arm, Fate gleams in every blow;
  In vain beneath unnumber'd wounds he bleeds,
  Nor wounds, nor death, distracted Nisus heeds;
  In viewless circles wheel'd his falchion flies,
  Nor quits the hero's grasp till Volscens dies;
  Deep in his throat its end the weapon found,
  The tyrant's soul fled groaning through the wound. 
  Thus Nisus all his fond affection prov'd--
  Dying, revenged the fate of him he lov'd;
  Then on his bosom sought his wonted place, 
  And death was heavenly, in his friend's embrace!

  Celestial pair! if aught my verse can claim,
  Wafted on Time's broad pinion, yours is fame! 
  Ages on ages shall your fate admire,
  No future day shall see your names expire,
  While stands the Capitol, immortal dome!
  And vanquished millions hail their Empress, Rome!

TRANSLATION FROM THE "MEDEA" OF EURIPIDES 

1.

  When fierce conflicting passions urge
  The breast, where love is wont to glow,
  What mind can stem the stormy surge
  Which rolls the tide of human woe?
  The hope of praise, the dread of shame,
  Can rouse the tortur'd breast no more;
  The wild desire, the guilty flame,
  Absorbs each wish it felt before.

2.

  But if affection gently thrills
  The soul, by purer dreams possest,
  The pleasing balm of mortal ills
  In love can soothe the aching breast:
  If thus thou comest in disguise, 
  Fair Venus! from thy native heaven,
  What heart, unfeeling, would despise
  The sweetest boon the Gods have given?

3.

  But, never from thy golden bow,
  May I beneath the shaft expire!
  Whose creeping venom, sure and slow,
  Awakes an all-consuming fire:
  Ye racking doubts! ye jealous fears!
  With others wage internal war;
  Repentance! source of future tears,
  From me be ever distant far!

4.

  May no distracting thoughts destroy
  The holy calm of sacred love!
  May all the hours be winged with joy,
  Which hover faithful hearts above!
  Fair Venus! on thy myrtle shrine
  May I with some fond lover sigh!
  Whose heart may mingle pure with mine,
  With me to live, with me to die!

5.

  My native soil! belov'd before,
  Now dearer, as my peaceful home,
  Ne'er may I quit thy rocky shore,
  A hapless banish'd wretch to roam!
  This very day, this very hour,
  May I resign this fleeting breath!
  Nor quit my silent humble bower;
  A doom, to me, far worse than death.

6.

  Have I not heard the exile's sigh,
  And seen the exile's silent tear,
  Through distant climes condemn'd to fly,
  A pensive, weary wanderer here?
  Ah! hapless dame!  no sire bewails,
  No friend thy wretched fate deplores,
  No kindred voice with rapture hails
  Thy steps within a stranger's doors.

7.

  Perish the fiend! whose iron heart
  To fair affection's truth unknown,
  Bids her he fondly lov'd depart,
  Unpitied, helpless, and alone;
  Who ne'er unlocks with silver key, 
  The milder treasures of his soul;
  May such a friend be far from me,
  And Ocean's storms between us roll!

LACHIN Y GAIR. 

1.

  Away, ye gay landscapes, ye gardens of roses!
  In you let the minions of luxury rove:
  Restore me the rocks, where the snow-flake reposes,
  Though still they are sacred to freedom and love:
  Yet, Caledonia, belov'd are thy mountains,
  Round their white summits though elements war:
  Though cataracts foam 'stead of smooth-flowing fountains,
    I sigh for the valley of dark Loch na Garr.

2.

  Ah! there my young footsteps in infancy, wander'd:
    My cap was the bonnet, my cloak was the plaid; 
  On chieftains, long perish'd, my memory ponder'd,
    As daily I strode through the pine-cover'd glade;
  I sought not my home, till the day's dying glory
    Gave place to the rays of the bright polar star;
  For fancy was cheer'd, by traditional story,
    Disclos'd by the natives of dark Loch na Garr.

3.

  "Shades of the dead! have I not heard your voices
    Rise on the night-rolling breath of the gale?"
  Surely, the soul of the hero rejoices,
    And rides on the wind, o'er his own Highland vale!
  Round Loch na Garr, while the stormy mist gathers,
    Winter presides in his cold icy car:
  Clouds, there, encircle the forms of my Fathers;
    They dwell in the tempests of dark Loch na Garr.

4.

  "Ill starr'd,  though brave, did no visions foreboding
    Tell you that fate had forsaken your cause?"
  Ah! were you destined to die at Culloden, 
    Victory crown'd not your fall with applause:
  Still were you happy, in death's earthy slumber,
    You rest with your clan, in the caves of Braemar; 
  The Pibroch  resounds, to the piper's loud number,
    Your deeds, on the echoes of dark Loch na Garr.

5.

  Years have roll'd on, Loch na Garr, since I left you,
    Years must elapse, ere I tread you again:
  Nature of verdure and flowers has bereft you,
    Yet still are you dearer than Albion's plain:
  England! thy beauties are tame and domestic,
    To one who has rov'd on the mountains afar:
  Oh! for the crags that are wild and majestic,
    The steep, frowning glories of dark Loch na Garr. 

TO ROMANCE.

1.

  Parent of golden dreams, Romance!
    Auspicious Queen of childish joys,
  Who lead'st along, in airy dance,
    Thy votive train of girls and boys;
  At length, in spells no longer bound,
    I break the fetters of my youth;
  No more I tread thy mystic round,
    But leave thy realms for those of Truth.

2.

  And yet 'tis hard to quit the dreams
    Which haunt the unsuspicious soul,
  Where every nymph a goddess seems, 
    Whose eyes through rays immortal roll;
  While Fancy holds her boundless reign,
    And all assume a varied hue;
  When Virgins seem no longer vain,
    And even Woman's smiles are true.

3.

  And must we own thee, but a name,
    And from thy hall of clouds descend?
  Nor find a Sylph in every dame,
    A Pylades  in every friend?
  But leave, at once, thy realms of air 
    To mingling bands of fairy elves;
  Confess that woman's false as fair,
    And friends have feeling for--themselves?

4.

  With shame, I own, I've felt thy sway;
    Repentant, now thy reign is o'er;
  No more thy precepts I obey,
    No more on fancied pinions soar;
  Fond fool! to love a sparkling eye,
    And think that eye to truth was dear;
  To trust a passing wanton's sigh,
  And melt beneath a wanton's tear!

5.

  Romance! disgusted with deceit,
    Far from thy motley court I fly,
  Where Affectation holds her seat,
    And sickly Sensibility;
  Whose silly tears can never flow
    For any pangs excepting thine;
  Who turns aside from real woe,
    To steep in dew thy gaudy shrine.

6.

  Now join with sable Sympathy,
    With cypress crown'd, array'd in weeds,
  Who heaves with thee her simple sigh,
    Whose breast for every bosom bleeds;
  And call thy sylvan female choir,
    To mourn a Swain for ever gone,
  Who once could glow with equal fire,
    But bends not now before thy throne.

7.

  Ye genial Nymphs, whose ready tears 
    On all occasions swiftly flow;
  Whose bosoms heave with fancied fears,
    With fancied flames and phrenzy glow
  Say, will you mourn my absent name,
    Apostate from your gentle train?
  An infant Bard, at least, may claim
    From you a sympathetic strain.

8.

  Adieu, fond race! a long adieu!
    The hour of fate is hovering nigh;
  E'en now the gulf appears in view,
    Where unlamented you must lie: 
  Oblivion's blackening lake is seen,
    Convuls'd by gales you cannot weather,
  Where you, and eke your gentle queen,
    Alas! must perish altogether.

TO EDWARD NOEL LONG, ESQ.  

    "Nil ego contulerim jucundo sanus amico."--HORACE.

  Dear LONG, in this sequester'd scene, 
    While all around in slumber lie,
  The joyous days, which ours have been
    Come rolling fresh on Fancy's eye;
  Thus, if, amidst the gathering storm,
  While clouds the darken'd noon deform,
  Yon heaven assumes a varied glow,
  I hail the sky's celestial bow,
  Which spreads the sign of future peace,
  And bids the war of tempests cease.
  Ah! though the present brings but pain,
  I think those days may come again;
  Or if, in melancholy mood,
  Some lurking envious fear intrude, 
  To check my bosom's fondest thought,
    And interrupt the golden dream,
  I crush the fiend with malice fraught,
    And, still, indulge my wonted theme.
  Although we ne'er again can trace,
    In Granta's vale, the pedant's lore,
  Nor through the groves of Ida chase
    Our raptured visions, as before;
  Though Youth has flown on rosy pinion,
  And Manhood claims his stern dominion,
  Age will not every hope destroy,
  But yield some hours of sober joy.

    Yes, I will hope that Time's broad wing
  Will shed around some dews of spring:
  But, if his scythe must sweep the flowers
  Which bloom among the fairy bowers,
  Where smiling Youth delights to dwell,
  And hearts with early rapture swell;
  If frowning Age, with cold controul,
  Confines the current of the soul,
  Congeals the tear of Pity's eye,
  Or checks the sympathetic sigh,
  Or hears, unmov'd, Misfortune's groan
  And bids me feel for self alone;
  Oh! may my bosom never learn
    To soothe its wonted heedless flow; 
  Still, still, despise the censor stern,
    But ne'er forget another's woe.
  Yes, as you knew me in the days,
    O'er which Remembrance yet delays, 
  Still may I rove untutor'd, wild,
    And even in age, at heart a child. 

  Though, now, on airy visions borne,
    To you my soul is still the same.
  Oft has it been my fate to mourn, 
    And all my former joys are tame:
  But, hence! ye hours of sable hue!
    Your frowns are gone, my sorrows o'er:
  By every bliss my childhood knew,
    I'll think upon your shade no more.
  Thus, when the whirlwind's rage is past,
    And caves their sullen roar enclose 
  We heed no more the wintry blast,
    When lull'd by zephyr to repose.
  Full often has my infant Muse,
    Attun'd to love her languid lyre;
  But, now, without a theme to choose,
    The strains in stolen sighs expire.
  My youthful nymphs, alas! are flown; 
    E----is a wife, and C----a mother,
  And Carolina sighs alone,
    And Mary's given to another;
  And Cora's eye, which roll'd on me,
    Can now no more my love recall--
  In truth, dear LONG, 'twas time to flee--
    For Cora's eye will shine on all.
  And though the Sun, with genial rays,
  His beams alike to all displays,
  And every lady's eye's a sun,
  These last should be confin'd to one.
  The soul's meridian don't become her, 
  Whose Sun displays a general summer!
  Thus faint is every former flame,
  And Passion's self is now a name;  
  As, when the ebbing flames are low,
    The aid which once improv'd their light,
  And bade them burn with fiercer glow,
    Now quenches all their sparks in night;
  Thus has it been with Passion's fires,
    As many a boy and girl remembers,
  While all the force of love expires,
    Extinguish'd with the dying embers.

    But now, dear LONG, 'tis midnight's noon,
  And clouds obscure the watery moon,
  Whose beauties I shall not rehearse,
  Describ'd in every stripling's verse;
  For why should I the path go o'er
  Which every bard has trod before? 
  Yet ere yon silver lamp of night
    Has thrice perform'd her stated round,
  Has thrice retrac'd her path of light,
    And chas'd away the gloom profound,
  I trust, that we, my gentle Friend,
  Shall see her rolling orbit wend,
  Above the dear-lov'd peaceful seat,
  Which once contain'd our youth's retreat;
  And, then, with those our childhood knew,
  We'll mingle in the festive crew;
  While many a tale of former day
  Shall wing the laughing hours away;
  And all the flow of souls shall pour
  The sacred intellectual shower,
  Nor cease, till Luna's waning horn,
  Scarce glimmers through the mist of Morn.

TO A LADY. 

1.

  Oh! had my Fate been join'd with thine, 
    As once this pledge appear'd a token,
  These follies had not, then, been mine,
    For, then, my peace had not been broken.

2.

  To thee, these early faults I owe,
    To thee, the wise and old reproving:
  They know my sins, but do not know
    'Twas thine to break the bonds of loving.

3.

  For once my soul, like thine, was pure,
    And all its rising fires could smother;
  But, now, thy vows no more endure,
    Bestow'd by thee upon another. 

4.

  Perhaps, his peace I could destroy,
    And spoil the blisses that await him;
  Yet let my Rival smile in joy,
    For thy dear sake, I cannot hate him.

5.

  Ah! since thy angel form is gone,
    My heart no more can rest with any;
  But what it sought in thee alone,
    Attempts, alas! to find in many.

6.

  Then, fare thee well, deceitful Maid!
    'Twere vain and fruitless to regret thee;
  Nor Hope, nor Memory yield their aid,
    But Pride may teach me to forget thee.

7.

  Yet all this giddy waste of years,
    This tiresome round of palling pleasures;
  These varied loves, these matrons' fears,
    These thoughtless strains to Passion's measures--

8.

  If thou wert mine, had all been hush'd:--
    This cheek, now pale from early riot,
  With Passion's hectic ne'er had flush'd,
    But bloom'd in calm domestic quiet.

9.

  Yes, once the rural Scene was sweet,
    For Nature seem'd to smile before thee;
  And once my Breast abhorr'd deceit,--
    For then it beat but to adore thee.

10.

  But, now, I seek for other joys--
    To think, would drive my soul to madness;
  In thoughtless throngs, and empty noise,
    I conquer half my Bosom's sadness.

11.

  Yet, even in these, a thought will steal,
    In spite of every vain endeavour;
  And fiends might pity what I feel--
    To know that thou art lost for ever.

WHEN I ROVED A YOUNG HIGHLANDER. 

1.

  When I rov'd a young Highlander o'er the dark heath,
    And climb'd thy steep summit, oh Morven of snow! 
  To gaze on the torrent that thunder'd beneath,
    Or the mist of the tempest that gather'd below; 
  Untutor'd by science, a stranger to fear,
    And rude as the rocks, where my infancy grew,
  No feeling, save one, to my bosom was dear;
    Need I say, my sweet Mary,  'twas centred in you?

2.

  Yet it could not be Love, for I knew not the name,--
    What passion can dwell in the heart of a child?
  But, still, I perceive an emotion the same
    As I felt, when a boy, on the crag-cover'd wild:
  One image, alone, on my bosom impress'd,
    I lov'd my bleak regions, nor panted for new;
  And few were my wants, for my wishes were bless'd,
    And pure were my thoughts, for my soul was with you.

3.

  I arose with the dawn, with my dog as my guide,
    From mountain to mountain I bounded along;
  I breasted  the billows of Dee's  rushing tide,
    And heard at a distance the Highlander's song:
  At eve, on my heath-cover'd couch of repose.
    No dreams, save of Mary, were spread to my view;
  And warm to the skies my devotions arose,
    For the first of my prayers was a blessing on you.

4.

  I left my bleak home, and my visions are gone;
    The mountains are vanish'd, my youth is no more;
  As the last of my race, I must wither alone,
    And delight but in days, I have witness'd before:
  Ah! splendour has rais'd, but embitter'd my lot;
    More dear were the scenes which my infancy knew:
  Though my hopes may have fail'd, yet they are not
    forgot,
  Though cold is my heart, still it lingers with you.

5.

  When I see some dark hill point its crest to the sky,
    I think of the rocks that o'ershadow Colbleen; 
  When I see the soft blue of a love-speaking eye,
    I think of those eyes that endear'd the rude scene;
  When, haply, some light-waving locks I behold,
    That faintly resemble my Mary's in hue,
  I think on the long flowing ringlets of gold,
    The locks that were sacred to beauty, and you.

6.

  Yet the day may arrive, when the mountains once more
    Shall rise to my sight, in their mantles of snow;
  But while these soar above me, unchang'd as before,
    Will Mary be there to receive me?--ah, no!
  Adieu, then, ye hills, where my childhood was bred!
    Thou sweet flowing Dee, to thy waters adieu!
  No home in the forest shall shelter my head,--
    Ah! Mary, what home could be mine, but with you?

TO THE DUKE OF DORSET.  

  Dorset! whose early steps with mine have stray'd, 
  Exploring every path of Ida's glade;
  Whom, still, affection taught me to defend,
  And made me less a tyrant than a friend,
  Though the harsh custom of our youthful band
  Bade thee obey, and gave me to command; 
  Thee, on whose head a few short years will shower
  The gift of riches, and the pride of power;
  E'en now a name illustrious is thine own,
  Renown'd in rank, not far beneath the throne.
  Yet, Dorset, let not this seduce thy soul 
  To shun fair science, or evade controul;
  Though passive tutors,  fearful to dispraise
  The titled child, whose future breath may raise,
  View ducal errors with indulgent eyes,
  And wink at faults they tremble to chastise.
  When youthful parasites, who bend the knee
  To wealth, their golden idol, not to thee,--
  And even in simple boyhood's opening dawn
  Some slaves are found to flatter and to fawn,--
  When these declare, "that pomp alone should wait
  On one by birth predestin'd to be great;
  That books were only meant for drudging fools,
  That gallant spirits scorn the common rules;"
  Believe them not,--they point the path to shame,
  And seek to blast the honours of thy name:
  Turn to the few in Ida's early throng,
  Whose souls disdain not to condemn the wrong;
  Or if, amidst the comrades of thy youth,
  None dare to raise the sterner voice of truth,
  Ask thine own heart--'twill bid thee, boy, forbear!
  For well I know that virtue lingers there.

  Yes! I have mark'd thee many a passing day,
  But now new scenes invite me far away;
  Yes! I have mark'd within that generous mind
  A soul, if well matur'd, to bless mankind;
  Ah! though myself, by nature haughty, wild,
  Whom Indiscretion hail'd her favourite child;
  Though every error stamps me for her own,
  And dooms my fall, I fain would fall alone;
  Though my proud heart no precept, now, can tame,
  I love the virtues which I cannot claim.

  'Tis not enough, with other sons of power,
  To gleam the lambent meteor of an hour;
  To swell some peerage page in feeble pride,
  With long-drawn names that grace no page beside;
  Then share with titled crowds the common lot--
  In life just gaz'd at, in the grave forgot;
  While nought divides thee from the vulgar dead,
  Except the dull cold stone that hides thy head,
  The mouldering 'scutcheon, or the Herald's roll,
  That well-emblazon'd but neglected scroll,
  Where Lords, unhonour'd, in the tomb may find
  One spot, to leave a worthless name behind.
  There sleep, unnotic'd as the gloomy vaults
  That veil their dust, their follies, and their faults,
  A race, with old armorial lists o'erspread,
  In records destin'd never to be read.
  Fain would I view thee, with prophetic eyes,
  Exalted more among the good and wise;
  A glorious and a long career pursue,
  As first in Rank, the first in Talent too:
  Spurn every vice, each little meanness shun;
  Not Fortune's minion, but her noblest son.
    Turn to the annals of a former day;
  Bright are the deeds thine earlier Sires display;
  One, though a courtier, lived a man of worth,
  And call'd, proud boast! the British drama forth. 
  Another view! not less renown'd for Wit;
  Alike for courts, and camps, or senates fit;
  Bold in the field, and favour'd by the Nine;
  In every splendid part ordain'd to shine;
  Far, far distinguished from the glittering throng,
  The pride of Princes, and the boast of Song. 
  Such were thy Fathers; thus preserve their name,
  Not heir to titles only, but to Fame.
  The hour draws nigh, a few brief days will close,
  To me, this little scene of joys and woes;
  Each knell of Time now warns me to resign
  Shades where Hope, Peace, and Friendship all were mine:
  Hope, that could vary like the rainbow's hue,
  And gild their pinions, as the moments flew;
  Peace, that reflection never frown'd away,
  By dreams of ill to cloud some future day;
  Friendship, whose truth let Childhood only tell;
  Alas! they love not long, who love so well.

  To these adieu! nor let me linger o'er
  Scenes hail'd, as exiles hail their native shore,
  Receding slowly, through the dark-blue deep,
  Beheld by eyes that mourn, yet cannot weep.

    Dorset, farewell! I will not ask one part 
  Of sad remembrance in so young a heart;
  The coming morrow from thy youthful mind
  Will sweep my name, nor leave a trace behind.
  And, yet, perhaps, in some maturer year,
  Since chance has thrown us in the self-same sphere,
  Since the same senate, nay, the same debate,
  May one day claim our suffrage for the state,
  We hence may meet, and pass each other by
  With faint regard, or cold and distant eye.
  For me, in future, neither friend nor foe,
  A stranger to thyself, thy weal or woe--
  With thee no more again I hope to trace
  The recollection of our early race;
  No more, as once, in social hours rejoice,
  Or hear, unless in crowds, thy well-known voice;
  Still, if the wishes of a heart untaught
  To veil those feelings, which, perchance, it ought,
  If these,--but let me cease the lengthen'd strain,--
  Oh! if these wishes are not breath'd in vain,
  The Guardian Seraph who directs thy fate
  Will leave thee glorious, as he found thee great.

TO THE EARL OF CLARE. 

    Tu semper amoris
    Sis memor, et cari comitis ne abscedat imago.

    VAL. FLAC. 'Argonaut', iv. 36.

1.

  Friend of my youth! when young we rov'd,
  Like striplings, mutually belov'd,
    With Friendship's purest glow;
  The bliss, which wing'd those rosy hours,
  Was such as Pleasure seldom showers
    On mortals here below.

2.

  The recollection seems, alone,
  Dearer than all the joys I've known,
    When distant far from you:
  Though pain, 'tis still a pleasing pain,
  To trace those days and hours again,
    And sigh again, adieu!

3.

  My pensive mem'ry lingers o'er,
  Those scenes to be enjoy'd no more,
    Those scenes regretted ever;
  The measure of our youth is full,
  Life's evening dream is dark and dull,
    And we may meet--ah! never!

4.

  As when one parent spring supplies
  Two streams, which from one fountain rise,
    Together join'd in vain;
  How soon, diverging from their source,
  Each, murmuring, seeks another course,
    Till mingled in the Main!

5.

  Our vital streams of weal or woe,
  Though near, alas! distinctly flow,
    Nor mingle as before:
  Now swift or slow, now black or clear,
  Till Death's unfathom'd gulph appear,
    And both shall quit the shore.

6.

  Our souls, my Friend! which once supplied
  One wish, nor breathed a thought beside,
    Now flow in different channels:
  Disdaining humbler rural sports,
  'Tis yours to mix in polish'd courts,
    And shine in Fashion's annals;

7.

  'Tis mine to waste on love my time,
  Or vent my reveries in rhyme,
    Without the aid of Reason;
  For Sense and Reason (critics know it)
  Have quitted every amorous Poet,
    Nor left a thought to seize on.

8.

  Poor LITTLE! sweet, melodious bard!
  Of late esteem'd it monstrous hard
    That he, who sang before all;
  He who the lore of love expanded,
  By dire Reviewers should be branded,
    As void of wit and moral. 

9.

  And yet, while Beauty's praise is thine,
  Harmonious favourite of the Nine!
    Repine not at thy lot.
  Thy soothing lays may still be read,
  When Persecution's arm is dead,
    And critics are forgot.

10.

  Still I must yield those worthies merit
  Who chasten, with unsparing spirit,
    Bad rhymes, and those who write them:
  And though myself may be the next
  By critic sarcasm to be vext,
    I really will not fight them. 

11.

  Perhaps they would do quite as well
  To break the rudely sounding shell
    Of such a young beginner:
  He who offends at pert nineteen,
  Ere thirty may become, I ween,
    A very harden'd sinner.

12.

  Now, Clare, I must return to you; 
  And, sure, apologies are due:
    Accept, then, my concession.
  In truth, dear Clare, in Fancy's flight 
  I soar along from left to right;
    My Muse admires digression.

13.

  I think I said 'twould be your fate
  To add one star to royal state;--
    May regal smiles attend you!
  And should a noble Monarch reign,
  You will not seek his smiles in vain,
    If worth can recommend you.

14.

  Yet since in danger courts abound,
  Where specious rivals glitter round,
    From snares may Saints preserve you;
  And grant your love or friendship ne'er
  From any claim a kindred care,
    But those who best deserve you!

15.

  Not for a moment may you stray
  From Truth's secure, unerring way!
    May no delights decoy!
  O'er roses may your footsteps move,
  Your smiles be ever smiles of love,
    Your tears be tears of joy!

16.

  Oh! if you wish that happiness
  Your coming days and years may bless,
    And virtues crown your brow;
  Be still as you were wont to be,
  Spotless as you've been known to me,--
    Be still as you are now. 

17.

  And though some trifling share of praise,
  To cheer my last declining days,
    To me were doubly dear;
  Whilst blessing your beloved name,
  I'd waive at once a Poet's fame,
    To prove a Prophet here.

I WOULD I WERE A CARELESS CHILD. 



  I would I were a careless child,
    Still dwelling in my Highland cave,
  Or roaming through the dusky wild,
    Or bounding o'er the dark blue wave;
  The cumbrous pomp of Saxon  pride,
    Accords not with the freeborn soul,
  Which loves the mountain's craggy side,
    And seeks the rocks where billows roll.

2.

  Fortune! take back these cultur'd lands,
    Take back this name of splendid sound!
  I hate the touch of servile hands,
    I hate the slaves that cringe around:
  Place me among the rocks I love,
    Which sound to Ocean's wildest roar;
  I ask but this--again to rove
    Through scenes my youth hath known before.

3.

  Few are my years, and yet I feel
    The World was ne'er design'd for me:
  Ah! why do dark'ning shades conceal
    The hour when man must cease to be?
  Once I beheld a splendid dream,
    A visionary scene of bliss:
  Truth!--wherefore did thy hated beam
    Awake me to a world like this?

4.

  I lov'd--but those I lov'd are gone;
    Had friends--my early friends are fled:
  How cheerless feels the heart alone,
    When all its former hopes are dead!
  Though gay companions, o'er the bowl
    Dispel awhile the sense of ill;
  Though Pleasure stirs the maddening soul,
    The heart--the heart--is lonely still.

5.

  How dull! to hear the voice of those
    Whom Rank or Chance, whom Wealth or Power,
  Have made, though neither friends nor foes,
    Associates of the festive hour.
  Give me again a faithful few,
    In years and feelings still the same,
  And I will fly the midnight crew,
    Where boist'rous Joy is but a name.

6.

  And Woman, lovely Woman! thou,
    My hope, my comforter, my all!
  How cold must be my bosom now,
    When e'en thy smiles begin to pall!
  Without a sigh would I resign,
    This busy scene of splendid Woe,
  To make that calm contentment mine,
    Which Virtue knows, or seems to know.

7.

  Fain would I fly the haunts of men --
    I seek to shun, not hate mankind;
  My breast requires the sullen glen,
    Whose gloom may suit a darken'd mind.
  Oh! that to me the wings were given,
    Which bear the turtle to her nest!
  Then would I cleave the vault of Heaven,
    To flee away, and be at rest. 

LINES WRITTEN BENEATH AN ELM IN THE
CHURCHYARD OF HARROW.  

  Spot of my youth! whose hoary branches sigh,
  Swept by the breeze that fans thy cloudless sky;
  Where now alone I muse, who oft have trod,
  With those I loved, thy soft and verdant sod;
  With those who, scatter'd far, perchance deplore,
  Like me, the happy scenes they knew before:
  Oh! as I trace again thy winding hill,
  Mine eyes admire, my heart adores thee still,
  Thou drooping Elm! beneath whose boughs I lay,
  And frequent mus'd the twilight hours away;
  Where, as they once were wont, my limbs recline,
  But, ah! without the thoughts which then were mine:
  How do thy branches, moaning to the blast,
  Invite the bosom to recall the past,
  And seem to whisper, as they gently swell,
  "Take, while thou canst, a lingering, last farewell!"

    When Fate shall chill, at length, this fever'd breast,
  And calm its cares and passions into rest,
  Oft have I thought, 'twould soothe my dying hour,--
  If aught may soothe, when Life resigns her power,--
  To know some humbler grave, some narrow cell,
  Would hide my bosom where it lov'd to dwell;
  With this fond dream, methinks 'twere sweet to die--
  And here it linger'd, here my heart might lie;
  Here might I sleep where all my hopes arose,
  Scene of my youth, and couch of my repose;
  For ever stretch'd beneath this mantling shade,
  Press'd by the turf where once my childhood play'd;
  Wrapt by the soil that veils the spot I lov'd,
  Mix'd with the earth o'er which my footsteps mov'd;
  Blest by the tongues that charm'd my youthful ear,
  Mourn'd by the few my soul acknowledged here;
  Deplor'd by those in early days allied,
  And unremember'd by the world beside.

FRAGMENT.

WRITTEN SHORTLY AFTER THE MARRIAGE OF MISS CHAWORTH. 

1.

  Hills of Annesley, Bleak and Barren,
    Where my thoughtless Childhood stray'd,
  How the northern Tempests, warring,
    Howl above thy tufted Shade!

2.

  Now no more, the Hours beguiling,
   Former favourite Haunts I see;
  Now no more my Mary smiling,
   Makes ye seem a Heaven to Me.

REMEMBRANCE.

  'Tis done!--I saw it in my dreams:
  No more with Hope the future beams;
    My days of happiness are few:
  Chill'd by Misfortune's wintry blast,
  My dawn of Life is overcast;
    Love, Hope, and Joy, alike adieu!
    Would I could add Remembrance too!

TO A LADY

WHO PRESENTED THE AUTHOR WITH THE VELVET BAND WHICH BOUND HER TRESSES.

1.

  This Band, which bound thy yellow hair
    Is mine, sweet girl! thy pledge of love;
  It claims my warmest, dearest care,
    Like relics left of saints above.

2.

  Oh! I will wear it next my heart;
    'Twill bind my soul in bonds to thee:
  From me again 'twill ne'er depart,
    But mingle in the grave with me.

3.

  The dew I gather from thy lip
    Is not so dear to me as this;
  That I but for a moment sip,
    And banquet on a transient bliss: 

4.

  This will recall each youthful scene,
    E'en when our lives are on the wane;
  The leaves of Love will still be green
    When Memory bids them bud again.

TO A KNOT OF UNGENEROUS CRITICS. 

  Rail on, Rail on, ye heartless crew!
  My strains were never meant for you;
  Remorseless Rancour still reveal,
  And damn the verse you cannot feel.
  Invoke those kindred passions' aid,
  Whose baleful stings your breasts pervade;
  Crush, if you can, the hopes of youth,
  Trampling regardless on the Truth:
  Truth's Records you consult in vain,
  She will not blast her native strain;
  She will assist her votary's cause,
  His will at least be her applause,
  Your prayer the gentle Power will spurn;
  To Fiction's motley altar turn,
  Who joyful in the fond address
  Her favoured worshippers will bless:
  And lo! she holds a magic glass,
  Where Images reflected pass,
  Bent on your knees the Boon receive--
  This will assist you to deceive--
  The glittering gift was made for you,
  Now hold it up to public view;
  Lest evil unforeseen betide,
  A Mask each canker'd brow shall hide,
  (Whilst Truth my sole desire is nigh,
  Prepared the danger to defy,)
  "There is the Maid's perverted name,
  And there the Poet's guilty Flame,
  Gloaming a deep phosphoric fire,
  Threatening--but ere it spreads, retire.
  Says Truth Up Virgins, do not fear!
  The Comet rolls its Influence here;
  'Tis Scandal's Mirror you perceive,
  These dazzling Meteors but deceive--
  Approach and touch--Nay do not turn
  It blazes there, but will not burn."--
  At once the shivering Mirror flies,
  Teeming no more with varnished Lies;
  The baffled friends of Fiction start,
  Too late desiring to depart--
  Truth poising high Ithuriel's spear
  Bids every Fiend unmask'd appear,
  The vizard tears from every face,
  And dooms them to a dire disgrace.
  For e'er they compass their escape,
  Each takes perforce a native shape--
  The Leader of the wrathful Band,
  Behold a portly Female stand!
  She raves, impelled by private pique,
  This mean unjust revenge to seek;
  From vice to save this virtuous Age,
  Thus does she vent indecent rage!
  What child has she of promise fair,
  Who claims a fostering Mother's care?
  Whose Innocence requires defence,
  Or forms at least a smooth pretence,
  Thus to disturb a harmless Boy,
  His humble hope, and peace annoy?
  She need not fear the amorous rhyme,
  Love will not tempt her future time,
  For her his wings have ceased to spread,
  No more he flutters round her head;
  Her day's Meridian now is past,
  The clouds of Age her Sun o'ercast;
  To her the strain was never sent,
  For feeling Souls alone 'twas meant--
  The verse she seized, unask'd, unbade,
  And damn'd, ere yet the whole was read!
  Yes! for one single erring verse,
  Pronounced an unrelenting Curse;
  Yes! at a first and transient view,
  Condemned a heart she never knew.--
  Can such a verdict then decide,
  Which springs from disappointed pride?
  Without a wondrous share of Wit,
  To judge is such a Matron fit?
  The rest of the censorious throng
  Who to this zealous Band belong,
  To her a general homage pay,
  And right or wrong her wish obey:
  Why should I point my pen of steel
  To break "such flies upon the wheel?"
  With minds to Truth and Sense unknown,
  Who dare not call their words their own.
  Rail on, Rail on, ye heartless Crew!
  Your Leader's grand design pursue:
  Secure behind her ample shield,
  Yours is the harvest of the field.--
  My path with thorns you cannot strew,
  Nay more, my warmest thanks are due;
  When such as you revile my Name,
  Bright beams the rising Sun of Fame,
  Chasing the shades of envious night,
  Outshining every critic Light.--
  Such, such as you will serve to show
  Each radiant tint with higher glow.
  Vain is the feeble cheerless toil,
  Your efforts on yourselves recoil;
  Then Glory still for me you raise,
  Yours is the Censure, mine the Praise.

SOLILOQUY OF A BARD IN THE COUNTRY. 

  'Twas now the noon of night, and all was still,
  Except a hapless Rhymer and his quill.
  In vain he calls each Muse in order down,
  Like other females, these will sometimes frown;
  He frets, be fumes, and ceasing to invoke
  The Nine, in anguish'd accents thus he spoke:
  Ah what avails it thus to waste my time,
  To roll in Epic, or to rave in Rhyme?
  What worth is some few partial readers' praise.
  If ancient Virgins croaking 'censures' raise?
  Where few attend, 'tis useless to indite;
  Where few can read, 'tis folly sure to write;
  Where none but girls and striplings dare admire,
  And Critics rise in every country Squire--
  But yet this last my candid Muse admits,
  When Peers are Poets, Squires may well be Wits;
  When schoolboys vent their amorous flames in verse,
  Matrons may sure their characters asperse;
  And if a little parson joins the train,
  And echos back his Patron's voice again--
  Though not delighted, yet I must forgive,
  Parsons as well as other folks must live:--
  From rage he rails not, rather say from dread,
  He does not speak for Virtue, but for bread;
  And this we know is in his Patron's giving,
  For Parsons cannot eat without a 'Living'.
  The Matron knows I love the Sex too well,
  Even unprovoked aggression to repel.
  What though from private pique her anger grew,
  And bade her blast a heart she never knew?
  What though, she said, for one light heedless line,
  That Wilmot's  verse was far more pure than mine!
  In wars like these, I neither fight nor fly,
  When 'dames' accuse 'tis bootless to deny;
  Her's be the harvest of the martial field,
  I can't attack, where Beauty forms the shield.
  But when a pert Physician loudly cries,
  Who hunts for scandal, and who lives by lies,
  A walking register of daily news,
  Train'd to invent, and skilful to abuse--
  For arts like these at bounteous tables fed,
  When S----condemns a book he never read.
  Declaring with a coxcomb's native air,
  The 'moral's' shocking, though the 'rhymes' are fair.
  Ah! must he rise unpunish'd from the feast,
  Nor lash'd by vengeance into truth at least?
  Such lenity were more than Man's indeed!
  Those who condemn, should surely deign to read.
  Yet must I spare--nor thus my pen degrade,
  I quite forgot that scandal was his trade.
  For food and raiment thus the coxcomb rails,
  For those who fear his physic, like his tales.
  Why should his harmless censure seem offence?
  Still let him eat, although at my expense,
  And join the herd to Sense and Truth unknown,
  Who dare not call their very thoughts their own,
  And share with these applause, a godlike bribe,
  In short, do anything, except prescribe:--
  For though in garb of Galen he appears,
  His practice is not equal to his years.
  Without improvement since he first began,
  A young Physician, though an ancient Man--
  Now let me cease--Physician, Parson, Dame,
  Still urge your task, and if you can, defame.
  The humble offerings of my Muse destroy,
  And crush, oh! noble conquest! crush a Boy.
  What though some silly girls have lov'd the strain,
  And kindly bade me tune my Lyre again;
  What though some feeling, or some partial few,
  Nay, Men of Taste and Reputation too,
  Have deign'd to praise the firstlings of my Muse--
  If you your sanction to the theme refuse,
  If you your great protection still withdraw,
  Whose Praise is Glory, and whose Voice is law!
  Soon must I fall an unresisting foe,
  A hapless victim yielding to the blow.--
  Thus Pope by Curl and Dennis was destroyed,
  Thus Gray and Mason yield to furious Lloyd; 
  From Dryden, Milbourne  tears the palm away,
  And thus I fall, though meaner far than they.
  As in the field of combat, side by side,
  A Fabius and some noble Roman died.

L'AMITIE, EST L'AMOUR SANS AILES. 

1.

  Why should my anxious breast repine,
    Because my youth is fled?
  Days of delight may still be mine;
    Affection is not dead.
  In tracing back the years of youth,
  One firm record, one lasting truth
    Celestial consolation brings;
  Bear it, ye breezes, to the seat,
  Where first my heart responsive beat,--
    "Friendship is Love without his wings!"

  Through few, but deeply chequer'd years,
    What moments have been mine!
  Now half obscured by clouds of tears,
    Now bright in rays divine;
  Howe'er my future doom be cast,
  My soul, enraptured with the past,
    To one idea fondly clings;
  Friendship! that thought is all thine own,
  Worth worlds of bliss, that thought alone--
    "Friendship is Love without his wings!"

  Where yonder yew-trees lightly wave
    Their branches on the gale,
  Unheeded heaves a simple grave,
    Which tells the common tale;
  Round this unconscious schoolboys stray,
  Till the dull knell of childish play
    From yonder studious mansion rings;
  But here, whene'er my footsteps move,
  My silent tears too plainly prove,
     "Friendship is Love without his wings!"

  Oh, Love! before thy glowing shrine,
    My early vows were paid;
  My hopes, my dreams, my heart was thine,
    But these are now decay'd;
  For thine are pinions like the wind,
  No trace of thee remains behind,
    Except, alas! thy jealous stings.
  Away, away! delusive power,
  Thou shall not haunt my coming hour;
    Unless, indeed, without thy wings.

  Seat of my youth!  thy distant spire
    Recalls each scene of joy;
  My bosom glows with former fire,--
    In mind again a boy.
  Thy grove of elms, thy verdant hill,
  Thy every path delights me still,
    Each flower a double fragrance flings;
  Again, as once, in converse gay,
  Each dear associate seems to say,
    "Friendship is Love without his wings!'

6.

  My Lycus!  wherefore dost thou weep?
    Thy falling tears restrain;
  Affection for a time may sleep,
    But, oh, 'twill wake again.
  Think, think, my friend, when next we meet,
  Our long-wished interview, how sweet!
    From this my hope of rapture springs;
  While youthful hearts thus fondly swell,
  Absence my friend, can only tell,
    "Friendship is Love without his wings!"

7.

  In one, and one alone deceiv'd,
    Did I my error mourn?
  No--from oppressive bonds reliev'd,
    I left the wretch to scorn.
  I turn'd to those my childhood knew,
  With feelings warm, with bosoms true,
    Twin'd with my heart's according strings;
  And till those vital chords shall break,
  For none but these my breast shall wake
    Friendship, the power deprived of wings!

  Ye few! my soul, my life is yours,
    My memory and my hope;
  Your worth a lasting love insures,
    Unfetter'd in its scope;
  From smooth deceit and terror sprung,
  With aspect fair and honey'd tongue,
    Let Adulation wait on kings;
  With joy elate, by snares beset,
  We, we, my friends, can ne'er forget,
    "Friendship is Love without his wings!"

  Fictions and dreams inspire the bard,
    Who rolls the epic song;
  Friendship and truth be my reward--
    To me no bays belong;
  If laurell'd Fame but dwells with lies,
  Me the enchantress ever flies,
    Whose heart and not whose fancy sings;
  Simple and young, I dare not feign;
  Mine be the rude yet heartfelt strain,
    "Friendship is Love without his wings!"

THE PRAYER OF NATURE. 

  Father of Light! great God of Heaven!
    Hear'st thou the accents of despair?
  Can guilt like man's be e'er forgiven?
    Can vice atone for crimes by prayer?

  Father of Light, on thee I call!
    Thou see'st my soul is dark within;
  Thou, who canst mark the sparrow's fall,
    Avert from me the death of sin.

  No shrine I seek, to sects unknown;
    Oh, point to me the path of truth!
  Thy dread Omnipotence I own;
    Spare, yet amend, the faults of youth.

  Let bigots rear a gloomy fane,
    Let Superstition hail the pile,
  Let priests, to spread their sable reign,
    With tales of mystic rites beguile.

  Shall man confine his Maker's sway
    To Gothic domes of mouldering stone?
  Thy temple is the face of day;
    Earth, Ocean, Heaven thy boundless throne.

  Shall man condemn his race to Hell,
    Unless they bend in pompous form?
  Tell us that all, for one who fell,
    Must perish in the mingling storm?

  Shall each pretend to reach the skies,
    Yet doom his brother to expire,
  Whose soul a different hope supplies,
    Or doctrines less severe inspire?

  Shall these, by creeds they can't expound,
    Prepare a fancied bliss or woe?
  Shall reptiles, groveling on the ground,
    Their great Creator's purpose know?

  Shall those, who live for self alone, 
    Whose years float on in daily crime--
  Shall they, by Faith, for guilt atone,
    And live beyond the bounds of Time?

  Father! no prophet's laws I seek,--
    Thy laws in Nature's works appear;--
  I own myself corrupt and weak,
    Yet will I pray, for thou wilt hear!

  Thou, who canst guide the wandering star,
    Through trackless realms of aether's space;
  Who calm'st the elemental war,
    Whose hand from pole to pole I trace:

  Thou, who in wisdom plac'd me here,
    Who, when thou wilt, canst take me hence,
  Ah! whilst I tread this earthly sphere,
    Extend to me thy wide defence.

  To Thee, my God, to thee I call!
    Whatever weal or woe betide,
  By thy command I rise or fall,
    In thy protection I confide.

14.

  If, when this dust to dust's restor'd,
    My soul shall float on airy wing,
  How shall thy glorious Name ador'd
    Inspire her feeble voice to sing!

  But, if this fleeting spirit share
    With clay the Grave's eternal bed,
  While Life yet throbs I raise my prayer,
    Though doom'd no more to quit the dead.

  To Thee I breathe my humble strain,
    Grateful for all thy mercies past,
  And hope, my God, to thee again 
    This erring life may fly at last.

TRANSLATION FROM ANACREON. 

ODE

  Mingle with the genial bowl
  The Rose, the 'flow'ret' of the Soul,
  The Rose and Grape together quaff'd,
  How doubly sweet will be the draught!
  With Roses crown our jovial brows,
  While every cheek with Laughter glows;
  While Smiles and Songs, with Wine incite,
  To wing our moments with Delight.
  Rose by far the fairest birth,
  Which Spring and Nature cull from Earth--
  Rose whose sweetest perfume given,
  Breathes our thoughts from Earth to Heaven.
  Rose whom the Deities above,
  From Jove to Hebe, dearly love,
  When Cytherea's blooming Boy,
  Flies lightly through the dance of Joy,
  With him the Graces then combine,
  And rosy wreaths their locks entwine.
  Then will I sing divinely crown'd,
  With dusky leaves my temples bound--
  Lyaeus! in thy bowers of pleasure,
  I'll wake a wildly thrilling measure.
  There will my gentle Girl and I,
  Along the mazes sportive fly,
  Will bend before thy potent throne--
  Rose, Wine, and Beauty, all my own.

OSSIAN'S ADDRESS TO THE SUN IN "CARTHON." 

  Oh! thou that roll'st above thy glorious Fire,
  Round as the shield which grac'd my godlike Sire,
  Whence are the beams, O Sun! thy endless blaze,
  Which far eclipse each minor Glory's rays?
  Forth in thy Beauty here thou deign'st to shine!
  Night quits her car, the twinkling stars decline;
  Pallid and cold the Moon descends to cave
  Her sinking beams beneath the Western wave;
  But thou still mov'st alone, of light the Source--
  Who can o'ertake thee in thy fiery course?
  Oaks of the mountains fall, the rocks decay,
  Weighed down with years the hills dissolve away.
  A certain space to yonder Moon is given,
  She rises, smiles, and then is lost in Heaven.
  Ocean in sullen murmurs ebbs and flows,
  But thy bright beam unchanged for ever glows!
  When Earth is darkened with tempestuous skies,
  When Thunder shakes the sphere and Lightning flies,
  Thy face, O Sun, no rolling blasts deform,
  Thou look'st from clouds and laughest at the Storm.
  To Ossian, Orb of Light! thou look'st in vain,
  Nor cans't thou glad his aged eyes again,
  Whether thy locks in Orient Beauty stream,
  Or glimmer through the West with fainter gleam--
  But thou, perhaps, like me with age must bend;
  Thy season o'er, thy days will find their end,
  No more yon azure vault with rays adorn,
  Lull'd in the clouds, nor hear the voice of Morn.
  Exult, O Sun, in all thy youthful strength!
  Age, dark unlovely Age, appears at length,
  As gleams the moonbeam through the broken cloud
  While mountain vapours spread their misty shroud--
  The Northern tempest howls along at last,
  And wayworn strangers shrink amid the blast.
  Thou rolling Sun who gild'st those rising towers,
  Fair didst thou shine upon my earlier hours!
  I hail'd with smiles the cheering rays of Morn,
  My breast by no tumultuous Passion torn--
  Now hateful are thy beams which wake no more
  The sense of joy which thrill'd my breast before;
  Welcome thou cloudy veil of nightly skies,
  To thy bright canopy the mourner flies:
  Once bright, thy Silence lull'd my frame to rest,
  And Sleep my soul with gentle visions blest;
  Now wakeful Grief disdains her mild controul,
  Dark is the night, but darker is my Soul.
  Ye warring Winds of Heav'n your fury urge,
  To me congenial sounds your wintry Dirge:
  Swift as your wings my happier days have past,
  Keen as your storms is Sorrow's chilling blast;
  To Tempests thus expos'd my Fate has been,
  Piercing like yours, like yours, alas! unseen.

PIGNUS AMORIS. 

  As by the fix'd decrees of Heaven,
  'Tis vain to hope that Joy can last;
  The dearest boon that Life has given,
  To me is--visions of the past.

2.

  For these this toy of blushing hue
    I prize with zeal before unknown,
  It tells me of a Friend I knew,
    Who loved me for myself alone.

3.

  It tells me what how few can say
    Though all the social tie commend;
  Recorded in my heart 'twill lay, 
    It tells me mine was once a Friend.

4.

  Through many a weary day gone by,
    With time the gift is dearer grown;
  And still I view in Memory's eye
    That teardrop sparkle through my own.

5.

  And heartless Age perhaps will smile,
    Or wonder whence those feelings sprung;
  Yet let not sterner souls revile,
    For Both were open, Both were young.

6.

  And Youth is sure the only time,
    When Pleasure blends no base alloy;
  When Life is blest without a crime,
    And Innocence resides with Joy.

  Let those reprove my feeble Soul,
    Who laugh to scorn Affection's name;
  While these impose a harsh controul,
    All will forgive who feel the same.

  Then still I wear my simple toy,
    With pious care from wreck I'll save it;
  And this will form a dear employ
    For dear I was to him who gave it.

A WOMAN'S HAIR. 

  Oh! little lock of golden hue
    In gently waving ringlet curl'd,
  By the dear head on which you grew,
    I would not lose you for a world.

  Not though a thousand more adorn
    The polished brow where once you shone,
  Like rays which guild a cloudless sky 
    Beneath Columbia's fervid zone.

STANZAS TO JESSY. 

  There is a mystic thread of life
    So dearly wreath'd with mine alone,
  That Destiny's relentless knife
    At once must sever both, or none.

  There is a Form on which these eyes
    Have fondly gazed with such delight--
  By day, that Form their joy supplies,
    And Dreams restore it, through the night.

  There is a Voice whose tones inspire
    Such softened feelings in my breast, --
  I would not hear a Seraph Choir,
    Unless that voice could join the rest.

  There is a Face whose Blushes tell
    Affection's tale upon the cheek,
  But pallid at our fond farewell,
    Proclaims more love than words can speak.

  There is a Lip, which mine has prest,
    But none had ever prest before;
  It vowed to make me sweetly blest,
    That mine alone should press it more. 

  There is a Bosom all my own,
    Has pillow'd oft this aching head,
  A Mouth which smiles on me alone,
    An Eye, whose tears with mine are shed.

  There are two Hearts whose movements thrill,
    In unison so closely sweet,
  That Pulse to Pulse responsive still
    They Both must heave, or cease to beat.

  There are two Souls, whose equal flow
    In gentle stream so calmly run,
  That when they part--they part?--ah no!
    They cannot part--those Souls are One.

THE ADIEU.

WRITTEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD SOON DIE.

1.

  Adieu, thou Hill!  where early joy
    Spread roses o'er my brow;
  Where Science seeks each loitering boy
    With knowledge to endow.
  Adieu, my youthful friends or foes,
  Partners of former bliss or woes;
    No more through Ida's paths we stray;
  Soon must I share the gloomy cell,
  Whose ever-slumbering inmates dwell
    Unconscious of the day.

2.

  Adieu, ye hoary Regal Fanes, 
    Ye spires of Granta's vale,
  Where Learning robed in sable reigns.
    And Melancholy pale.
  Ye comrades of the jovial hour,
  Ye tenants of the classic bower,
  On Cama's verdant margin plac'd,
  Adieu! while memory still is mine,
  For offerings on Oblivion's shrine,
  These scenes must be effac'd.

  Adieu, ye mountains of the clime
  Where grew my youthful years;
  Where Loch na Garr in snows sublime
  His giant summit rears.
  Why did my childhood wander forth
  From you, ye regions of the North,
  With sons of Pride to roam?
  Why did I quit my Highland cave,
  Marr's dusky heath, and Dee's clear wave,
  To seek a Sotheron home?

  Hall of my Sires! a long farewell--
  Yet why to thee adieu?
  Thy vaults will echo back my knell,
  Thy towers my tomb will view:
  The faltering tongue which sung thy fall,
  And former glories of thy Hall,
  Forgets its wonted simple note--
  But yet the Lyre retains the strings,
  And sometimes, on Aeolian wings,
  In dying strains may float.

5.

  Fields, which surround yon rustic cot, 
    While yet I linger here,
  Adieu! you are not now forgot,
    To retrospection dear.
  Streamlet!  along whose rippling surge
  My youthful limbs were wont to urge,
    At noontide heat, their pliant course;
  Plunging with ardour from the shore,
  Thy springs will lave these limbs no more,
    Deprived of active force.

6.

  And shall I here forget the scene,
    Still nearest to my breast?
  Rocks rise and rivers roll between
    The spot which passion blest;
  Yet Mary,  all thy beauties seem
  Fresh as in Love's bewitching dream,
    To me in smiles display'd;
  Till slow disease resigns his prey
  To Death, the parent of decay,
    Thine image cannot fade.

7.

  And thou, my Friend! whose gentle love
    Yet thrills my bosom's chords,
  How much thy friendship was above
    Description's power of words!
  Still near my breast thy gift  I wear 
  Which sparkled once with Feeling's tear,
    Of Love the pure, the sacred gem:
  Our souls were equal, and our lot
  In that dear moment quite forgot;
    Let Pride alone condemn!

8.

  All, all is dark and cheerless now!
    No smile of Love's deceit
  Can warm my veins with wonted glow,
    Can bid Life's pulses beat:
  Not e'en the hope of future fame
  Can wake my faint, exhausted frame,
    Or crown with fancied wreaths my head.
  Mine is a short inglorious race,--
  To humble in the dust my face,
    And mingle with the dead.

9.

  Oh Fame! thou goddess of my heart;
    On him who gains thy praise,
  Pointless must fall the Spectre's dart,
    Consumed in Glory's blaze;
  But me she beckons from the earth,
  My name obscure, unmark'd my birth,
    My life a short and vulgar dream:
  Lost in the dull, ignoble crowd,
  My hopes recline within a shroud,
    My fate is Lethe's stream.

10.

  When I repose beneath the sod,
    Unheeded in the clay,
  Where once my playful footsteps trod,
    Where now my head must lay, 
  The meed of Pity will be shed
  In dew-drops o'er my narrow bed,
    By nightly skies, and storms alone;
  No mortal eye will deign to steep
  With tears the dark sepulchral deep
    Which hides a name unknown.

11.

  Forget this world, my restless sprite,
    Turn, turn thy thoughts to Heaven:
  There must thou soon direct thy flight,
    If errors are forgiven.
  To bigots and to sects unknown,
  Bow down beneath the Almighty's Throne;
    To Him address thy trembling prayer:
  He, who is merciful and just,
  Will not reject a child of dust,
    Although His meanest care.

12.

  Father of Light! to Thee I call;
    My soul is dark within:
  Thou who canst mark the sparrow's fall,
    Avert the death of sin.
  Thou, who canst guide the wandering star
  Who calm'st the elemental war,
    Whose mantle is yon boundless sky,
  My thoughts, my words, my crimes forgive;
  And, since I soon must cease to live,
    Instruct me how to die. 

TO----

1.

  Oh! well I know your subtle Sex,
    Frail daughters of the wanton Eve,--
  While jealous pangs our Souls perplex,
  No passion prompts you to relieve.

  From Love, or Pity ne'er you fall,
  By you, no mutual Flame is felt,
  "Tis Vanity, which rules you all,
  Desire alone which makes you melt.

  I will not say no souls are yours,
  Aye, ye have Souls, and dark ones too,
  Souls to contrive those smiling lures,
  To snare our simple hearts for you.

  Yet shall you never bind me fast,
  Long to adore such brittle toys,
  I'll rove along, from first to last,
  And change whene'er my fancy cloys.

  Oh! I should be a baby fool,
  To sigh the dupe of female art--
  Woman! perhaps thou hast a Soul,
  But where have Demons hid thy Heart?

ON THE EYES OF MISS A----H----

  Anne's Eye is liken'd to the Sun,
    From it such Beams of Beauty fall;
  And this can be denied by none,
    For like the Sun, it shines on All.

  Then do not admiration smother,
    Or say these glances don't become her;
  To you, or I, or any other
    Her Sun, displays perpetual Summer. 

TO A VAIN LADY. 

  Ah, heedless girl! why thus disclose
    What ne'er was meant for other ears;
  Why thus destroy thine own repose,
    And dig the source of future tears?

  Oh, thou wilt weep, imprudent maid,
  While lurking envious foes will smile,
  For all the follies thou hast said
  Of those who spoke but to beguile.

  Vain girl! thy lingering woes are nigh,
  If thou believ'st what striplings say:
  Oh, from the deep temptation fly,
  Nor fall the specious spoiler's prey.

  Dost thou repeat, in childish boast,
  The words man utters to deceive?
  Thy peace, thy hope, thy all is lost,
  If thou canst venture to believe.

  While now amongst thy female peers
  Thou tell'st again the soothing tale,
  Canst thou not mark the rising sneers
  Duplicity in vain would veil?

  These tales in secret silence hush,
  Nor make thyself the public gaze:
  What modest maid without a blush
  Recounts a flattering coxcomb's praise?

7.

  Will not the laughing boy despise
  Her who relates each fond conceit--
  Who, thinking Heaven is in her eyes,
  Yet cannot see the slight deceit?

8.

  For she who takes a soft delight
  These amorous nothings in revealing,
  Must credit all we say or write,
  While vanity prevents concealing.

9.

  Cease, if you prize your Beauty's reign!
  No jealousy bids me reprove:
  One, who is thus from nature vain,
  I pity, but I cannot love.

TO ANNE. 

1.

  Oh, Anne, your offences to me have been grievous:
  I thought from my wrath no atonement could save you;
  But Woman is made to command and deceive us--
  I look'd in your face, and I almost forgave you.

2.

  I vow'd I could ne'er for a moment respect you,
    Yet thought that a day's separation was long;
  When we met, I determined again to suspect you--
    Your smile soon convinced me suspicion was wrong.

3.

  I swore, in a transport of young indignation,
    With fervent contempt evermore to disdain you:
  I saw you--my anger became admiration;
    And now, all my wish, all my hope's to regain you.

4.

  With beauty like yours, oh, how vain the contention!
    Thus lowly I sue for forgiveness before you;--
  At once to conclude such a fruitless dissension,
    Be false, my sweet Anne, when I cease to adore you!

EGOTISM. A LETTER TO J. T. BECHER. 

1.

  If Fate should seal my Death to-morrow,
    (Though much I hope she will postpone it,)
  I've held a share Joy and Sorrow,
    Enough for Ten; and here I own it.

2.

  I've lived, as many others live,
  And yet, I think, with more enjoyment;
  For could I through my days again live,
  I'd pass them in the 'same' employment.

3.

  That 'is' to say, with 'some exception',
  For though I will not make confession,
  I've seen too much of man's deception
  Ever again to trust profession.

4.

  Some sage 'Mammas' with gesture haughty,
  Pronounce me quite a youthful Sinner--
  But 'Daughters' say, "although he's naughty,
  You must not check a 'Young Beginner'!"

5.

  I've loved, and many damsels know it--
  But whom I don't intend to mention,
  As 'certain stanzas' also show it,
  'Some' say 'deserving Reprehension'.

6.

  Some ancient Dames, of virtue fiery,
  (Unless Report does much belie them,)
  Have lately made a sharp Enquiry,
  And much it 'grieves' me to 'deny' them.

7.

  Two whom I lov'd had 'eyes' of 'Blue',
  To which I hope you've no objection;
  The 'Rest' had eyes of 'darker Hue'--
  Each Nymph, of course, was 'all perfection'.

8.

  But here I'll close my 'chaste' Description,
  Nor say the deeds of animosity;
  For 'silence' is the best prescription,
  To 'physic' idle curiosity.

9.

  Of 'Friends' I've known a 'goodly Hundred'--
  For finding 'one' in each acquaintance,
  By 'some deceived', by others plunder'd,
  'Friendship', to me, was not 'Repentance'.

10.

  At 'School' I thought like other 'Children';
  Instead of 'Brains', a fine Ingredient,
  'Romance', my 'youthful Head bewildering',
  To 'Sense' had made me disobedient.

11.

  A victim, 'nearly' from affection,
  To certain 'very precious scheming',
  The still remaining recollection
  Has 'cured' my 'boyish soul' of 'Dreaming'.

12.

  By Heaven! I rather would forswear
  The Earth, and all the joys reserved me,
  Than dare again the 'specious Snare',
  From which 'my Fate' and 'Heaven preserved' me.

13.

  Still I possess some Friends who love me--
  In each a much esteemed and true one;
  The Wealth of Worlds shall never move me
  To quit their Friendship, for a new one.

14.

  But Becher! you're a 'reverend pastor',
  Now take it in consideration,
  Whether for penance I should fast, or
  Pray for my 'sins' in expiation.

15.

  I own myself the child of 'Folly',
  But not so wicked as they make me--
  I soon must die of melancholy,
  If 'Female' smiles should e'er forsake me.

16.

  'Philosophers' have 'never doubted',
  That 'Ladies' Lips' were made for 'kisses!'
  For 'Love!' I could not live without it,
  For such a 'cursed' place as 'This is'.

17.

  Say, Becher, I shall be forgiven!
  If you don't warrant my salvation,
  I must resign all 'Hopes' of 'Heaven'!
  For, 'Faith', I can't withstand Temptation.

TO ANNE. 

  Oh say not, sweet Anne, that the Fates have decreed
  The heart which adores you should wish to dissever;
  Such Fates were to me most unkind ones indeed,--
  To bear me from Love and from Beauty for ever.

2.

  Your frowns, lovely girl, are the Fates which alone
  Could bid me from fond admiration refrain;
  By these, every hope, every wish were o'erthrown,
  Till smiles should restore me to rapture again.

3.

  As the ivy and oak, in the forest entwin'd,
  The rage of the tempest united must weather;
  My love and my life were by nature design'd
  To flourish alike, or to perish together.

4.

  Then say not, sweet Anne, that the Fates have decreed
    Your lover should bid you a lasting adieu:
  Till Fate can ordain that his bosom shall bleed,
    His Soul, his Existence, are centred in you.

TO THE AUTHOR OF A SONNET
BEGINNING "'SAD IS MY VERSE,' YOU SAY, 'AND YET NO TEAR.'"

1.

  Thy verse is "sad" enough, no doubt:
    A devilish deal more sad than witty!
  Why we should weep I can't find out,
    Unless for thee we weep in pity.

2.

  Yet there is one I pity more;
    And much, alas! I think he needs it:
  For he, I'm sure, will suffer sore,
    Who, to his own misfortune, reads it.

3.

  Thy rhymes, without the aid of magic,
    May once be read--but never after:
  Yet their effect's by no means tragic,
    Although by far too dull for laughter.

4.

  But would you make our bosoms bleed,
  And of no common pang complain--
  If you would make us weep indeed,
  Tell us, you'll read them o'er again.

ON FINDING A FAN. 

1.

  In one who felt as once he felt,
  This might, perhaps, have fann'd the flame;
  But now his heart no more will melt,
  Because that heart is not the same.

2.

  As when the ebbing flames are low,
  The aid which once improved their light,
  And bade them burn with fiercer glow,
  Now quenches all their blaze in night.

3.

  Thus has it been with Passion's fires--
  As many a boy and girl remembers--
  While every hope of love expires,
  Extinguish'd with the dying embers.

4.

  The first, though not a spark survive,
    Some careful hand may teach to burn;
  The last, alas! can ne'er survive;
    No touch can bid its warmth return.

5.

  Or, if it chance to wake again,
    Not always doom'd its heat to smother,
  It sheds (so wayward fates ordain)
    Its former warmth around another.

FAREWELL TO THE MUSE. 

1.

  Thou Power! who hast ruled me through Infancy's days,
    Young offspring of Fancy, 'tis time we should part;
  Then rise on the gale this the last of my lays,
    The coldest effusion which springs from my heart.

2.

  This bosom, responsive to rapture no more,
    Shall hush thy wild notes, nor implore thee to sing;
  The feelings of childhood, which taught thee to soar,
    Are wafted far distant on Apathy's wing.

3.

  Though simple the themes of my rude flowing Lyre,
    Yet even these themes are departed for ever;
  No more beam the eyes which my dream could inspire,
    My visions are flown, to return,--alas, never!

4.

  When drain'd is the nectar which gladdens the bowl,
    How vain is the effort delight to prolong!
  When cold is the beauty which dwelt in my soul, 
    What magic of Fancy can lengthen my song?

5.

  Can the lips sing of Love in the desert alone,
    Of kisses and smiles which they now must resign?
  Or dwell with delight on the hours that are flown?
    Ah, no! for those hours can no longer be mine.

6.

  Can they speak of the friends that I lived but to love? 
    Ah, surely Affection ennobles the strain!
  But how can my numbers in sympathy move,
    When I scarcely can hope to behold them again?

7.

  Can I sing of the deeds which my Fathers have done,
    And raise my loud harp to the fame of my Sires?
  For glories like theirs, oh, how faint is my tone!
    For Heroes' exploits how unequal my fires!

8.

  Untouch'd, then, my Lyre shall reply to the blast--
    'Tis hush'd; and my feeble endeavours are o'er;
  And those who have heard it will pardon the past,
    When they know that its murmurs shall vibrate no more.

9.

  And soon shall its wild erring notes be forgot,
    Since early affection and love is o'ercast:
  Oh! blest had my Fate been, and happy my lot,
    Had the first strain of love been the dearest, the last.

10.

  Farewell, my young Muse! since we now can ne'er meet; 
    If our songs have been languid, they surely are few:
  Let us hope that the present at least will be sweet--
    The present--which seals our eternal Adieu.

TO AN OAK AT NEWSTEAD. 

1.

  Young Oak! when I planted thee deep in the ground,
    I hoped that thy days would be longer than mine;
  That thy dark-waving branches would flourish around,
    And ivy thy trunk with its mantle entwine.

2.

  Such, such was my hope, when in Infancy's years,
    On the land of my Fathers I rear'd thee with pride;
  They are past, and I water thy stem with my tears,--
    Thy decay, not the weeds that surround thee can hide.

3.

  I left thee, my Oak, and, since that fatal hour,
    A stranger has dwelt in the hall of my Sire;
  Till Manhood shall crown me, not mine is the power,
    But his, whose neglect may have bade thee expire.

4.

  Oh! hardy thou wert--even now little care
    Might revive thy young head, and thy wounds gently
      heal:
  But thou wert not fated affection to share--
    For who could suppose that a Stranger would feel?

5.

  Ah, droop not, my Oak! lift thy head for a while;
    Ere twice round yon Glory this planet shall run,
  The hand of thy Master will teach thee to smile,
    When Infancy's years of probation are done.

6.

  Oh, live then, my Oak! tow'r aloft from the weeds,
    That clog thy young growth, and assist thy decay,
  For still in thy bosom are Life's early seeds,
    And still may thy branches their beauty display.

7.

  Oh! yet, if Maturity's years may be thine,
    Though I shall lie low in the cavern of Death,
  On thy leaves yet the day-beam of ages may shine, 
    Uninjured by Time, or the rude Winter's breath.

8.

  For centuries still may thy boughs lightly wave
    O'er the corse of thy Lord in thy canopy laid;
  While the branches thus gratefully shelter his grave,
    The Chief who survives may recline in thy shade.

9.

  And as he, with his boys, shall revisit this spot,
    He will tell them in whispers more softly to tread.
  Oh! surely, by these I shall ne'er be forgot;
    Remembrance still hallows the dust of the dead.

10.

  And here, will they say, when in Life's glowing prime,
    Perhaps he has pour'd forth his young simple lay,
  And here must he sleep, till the moments of Time
    Are lost in the hours of Eternity's day.

ON REVISITING HARROW. 

1.

  Here once engaged the stranger's view
    Young Friendship's record simply trac'd;
  Few were her words,--but yet, though few,
    Resentment's hand the line defac'd.

2.

  Deeply she cut--but not eras'd--
    The characters were still so plain,
  That Friendship once return'd, and gaz'd,--
    Till Memory hail'd the words again.

3.

  Repentance plac'd them as before;
    Forgiveness join'd her gentle name;
  So fair the inscription seem'd once more,
    That Friendship thought it still the same.

4.

  Thus might the Record now have been;
    But, ah, in spite of Hope's endeavour,
  Or Friendship's tears, Pride rush'd between,
    And blotted out the line for ever.

TO MY SON. 

1.

  Those flaxen locks, those eyes of blue
  Bright as thy mother's in their hue;
  Those rosy lips, whose dimples play
  And smile to steal the heart away,
  Recall a scene of former joy,
  And touch thy father's heart, my Boy!

2.

  And thou canst lisp a father's name--
  Ah, William, were thine own the same,--
  No self-reproach--but, let me cease--
  My care for thee shall purchase peace;
  Thy mother's shade shall smile in joy,
  And pardon all the past, my Boy!

3.

  Her lowly grave the turf has prest,
  And thou hast known a stranger's breast;
  Derision sneers upon thy birth,
  And yields thee scarce a name on earth;
  Yet shall not these one hope destroy,--
  A Father's heart is thine, my Boy!

4.

  Why, let the world unfeeling frown,
  Must I fond Nature's claims disown?
  Ah, no--though moralists reprove,
  I hail thee, dearest child of Love,
  Fair cherub, pledge of youth and joy--
  A Father guards thy birth, my Boy!

5.

  Oh,'twill be sweet in thee to trace,
  Ere Age has wrinkled o'er my face,
  Ere half my glass of life is run,
  At once a brother and a son;
  And all my wane of years employ
  In justice done to thee, my Boy!

6.

  Although so young thy heedless sire,
  Youth will not damp parental fire;
  And, wert thou still less dear to me,
  While Helen's form revives in thee,
  The breast, which beat to former joy,
  Will ne'er desert its pledge, my Boy!

QUERIES TO CASUISTS. 

  The Moralists tell us that Loving is Sinning,
    And always are prating about and about it,
  But as Love of Existence itself's the beginning,
    Say, what would Existence itself be without it?

  They argue the point with much furious Invective,
    Though perhaps 'twere no difficult task to confute it;
  But if Venus and Hymen should once prove defective,
    Pray who would there be to defend or dispute it?

SONG.

1.

  Breeze of the night in gentler sighs
    More softly murmur o'er the pillow;
  For Slumber seals my Fanny's eyes,
    And Peace must never shun her pillow.

2.

  Or breathe those sweet Aeolian strains
    Stolen from celestial spheres above,
  To charm her ear while some remains,
    And soothe her soul to dreams of love.

3.

  But Breeze of night again forbear,
    In softest murmurs only sigh:
  Let not a Zephyr's pinion dare
    To lift those auburn locks on high.

4.

  Chill is thy Breath, thou breeze of night!
    Oh! ruffle not those lids of Snow;
  For only Morning's cheering light
    May wake the beam that lurks below.

5.

  Blest be that lip and azure eye!
    Sweet Fanny, hallowed be thy Sleep!
  Those lips shall never vent a sigh,
    Those eyes may never wake to weep.

TO HARRIET. 

1.

  Harriet! to see such Circumspection, 
  In Ladies I have no objection
    Concerning what they read;
  An ancient Maid's a sage adviser,
  Like her, you will be much the wiser,
    In word, as well as Deed.

2.

  But Harriet, I don't wish to flatter,
  And really think 't would make the matter
    More perfect if not quite,
  If other Ladies when they preach,
  Would certain Damsels also teach
    More cautiously to write.

THERE WAS A TIME, I NEED NOT NAME.  

1.

  There was a time, I need not name,
    Since it will ne'er forgotten be,
  When all our feelings were the same
    As still my soul hath been to thee.

2.

  And from that hour when first thy tongue
    Confess'd a love which equall'd mine,
  Though many a grief my heart hath wrung,
    Unknown, and thus unfelt, by thine,

3.

  None, none hath sunk so deep as this--
    To think how all that love hath flown;
  Transient as every faithless kiss,
    But transient in thy breast alone.

4.

  And yet my heart some solace knew,
    When late I heard thy lips declare,
  In accents once imagined true,
    Remembrance of the days that were.

5.

  Yes! my adored, yet most unkind!
    Though thou wilt never love again,
  To me 'tis doubly sweet to find
    Remembrance of that love remain. 

6.

  Yes! 'tis a glorious thought to me,
    Nor longer shall my soul repine,
  Whate'er thou art or e'er shall be,
    Thou hast been dearly, solely mine.

AND WILT THOU WEEP WHEN I AM LOW? 

1.

  And wilt thou weep when I am low?
    Sweet lady! speak those words again:
  Yet if they grieve thee, say not so--
    I would not give that bosom pain.

2.

  My heart is sad, my hopes are gone,
    My blood runs coldly through my breast;
  And when I perish, thou alone
    Wilt sigh above my place of rest.

3.

  And yet, methinks, a gleam of peace
    Doth through my cloud of anguish shine:
  And for a while my sorrows cease,
    To know thy heart hath felt for mine.

4.

  Oh lady! blessed be that tear--
    It falls for one who cannot weep;
  Such precious drops are doubly dear 
    To those whose eyes no tear may steep.

5.

  Sweet lady! once my heart was warm
    With every feeling soft as thine;
  But Beauty's self hath ceased to charm
    A wretch created to repine.

6. 

  Yet wilt thou weep when I am low?
  Sweet lady! speak those words again:
  Yet if they grieve thee, say not so--
  I would not give that bosom pain. 

REMIND ME NOT, REMIND ME NOT. 

1.

  Remind me not, remind me not,
    Of those beloved, those vanish'd hours,
      When all my soul was given to thee;
  Hours that may never be forgot,
    Till Time unnerves our vital powers,
      And thou and I shall cease to be.

2.

  Can I forget--canst thou forget,
    When playing with thy golden hair,
      How quick thy fluttering heart did move?
  Oh! by my soul, I see thee yet,
    With eyes so languid, breast so fair,
      And lips, though silent, breathing love.

3.

  When thus reclining on my breast,
   Those eyes threw back a glance so sweet,
      As half reproach'd yet rais'd desire,
  And still we near and nearer prest,
    And still our glowing lips would meet,
    As if in kisses to expire.

4.

  And then those pensive eyes would close,
    And bid their lids each other seek,
      Veiling the azure orbs below;
  While their long lashes' darken'd gloss
    Seem'd stealing o'er thy brilliant cheek,
      Like raven's plumage smooth'd on snow.

5.

  I dreamt last night our love return'd,
    And, sooth to say, that very dream
      Was sweeter in its phantasy,
  Than if for other hearts I burn'd,
    For eyes that ne'er like thine could beam
      In Rapture's wild reality.

6.

  Then tell me not, remind me not, 
    Of hours which, though for ever gone,
      Can still a pleasing dream restore, 
  Till thou and I shall be forgot,
    And senseless, as the mouldering stone
      Which tells that we shall be no more.

TO A YOUTHFUL FRIEND. 

1.

  Few years have pass'd since thou and I
    Were firmest friends, at least in name,
  And Childhood's gay sincerity
    Preserved our feelings long the same. 

2.

  But now, like me, too well thou know'st 
    What trifles oft the heart recall;
  And those who once have loved the most
    Too soon forget they lov'd at all. 

3.

  And such the change the heart displays,
    So frail is early friendship's reign, 
  A month's brief lapse, perhaps a day's,
    Will view thy mind estrang'd again. 

4.

  If so, it never shall be mine
    To mourn the loss of such a heart;
  The fault was Nature's fault, not thine,
    Which made thee fickle as thou art.

5.

  As rolls the Ocean's changing tide,
    So human feelings ebb and flow;
  And who would in a breast confide
    Where stormy passions ever glow?

6.

  It boots not that, together bred,
    Our childish days were days of joy:
  My spring of life has quickly fled;
    Thou, too, hast ceas'd to be a boy.

7.

  And when we bid adieu to youth,
    Slaves to the specious World's controul,
  We sigh a long farewell to truth;
    That World corrupts the noblest soul.

8.

  Ah, joyous season! when the mind 
    Dares all things boldly but to lie;
  When Thought ere spoke is unconfin'd,
    And sparkles in the placid eye.

9.

  Not so in Man's maturer years,
    When Man himself is but a tool;
  When Interest sways our hopes and fears,
    And all must love and hate by rule.

10.

  With fools in kindred vice the same, 
    We learn at length our faults to blend;
  And those, and those alone, may claim
    The prostituted name of friend.

11.

  Such is the common lot of man:
    Can we then 'scape from folly free?
  Can we reverse the general plan,
    Nor be what all in turn must be?

12.

  No; for myself, so dark my fate
    Through every turn of life hath been;
  Man and the World so much I hate,
    I care not when I quit the scene.

13.

  But thou, with spirit frail and light,
    Wilt shine awhile, and pass away;
  As glow-worms sparkle through the night,
    But dare not stand the test of day.

14.

  Alas! whenever Folly calls
    Where parasites and princes meet,
  (For cherish'd first in royal halls,
    The welcome vices kindly greet,)

15.

  Ev'n now thou'rt nightly seen to add
    One insect to the fluttering crowd;
  And still thy trifling heart is glad
    To join the vain and court the proud.

16.

  There dost thou glide from fair to fair,
    Still simpering on with eager haste,
  As flies along the gay parterre,
    That taint the flowers they scarcely taste.

17.

  But say, what nymph will prize the flame
    Which seems, as marshy vapours move,
  To flit along from dame to dame,
    An ignis-fatuus gleam of love?

18.

  What friend for thee, howe'er inclin'd,
    Will deign to own a kindred care?
  Who will debase his manly mind,
    For friendship every fool may share?

19.

  In time forbear; amidst the throng
    No more so base a thing be seen;
  No more so idly pass along;
    Be something, any thing, but--mean.

LINES INSCRIBED UPON A CUP FORMED FROM A SKULL. 

1.

  Start not--nor deem my spirit fled:
    In me behold the only skull,
  From which, unlike a living head,
    Whatever flows is never dull.

2.

  I lived, I loved, I quaff'd, like thee:
    I died: let earth my bones resign;
  Fill up--thou canst not injure me;
    The worm hath fouler lips than thine.

3.

  Better to hold the sparkling grape,
    Than nurse the earth-worm's slimy brood;
  And circle in the goblet's shape
    The drink of Gods, than reptile's food.

4.

  Where once my wit, perchance, hath shone,
    In aid of others' let me shine;
  And when, alas! our brains are gone,
    What nobler substitute than wine?

5.

  Quaff while thou canst: another race,
    When thou and thine, like me, are sped,
  May rescue thee from earth's embrace,
    And rhyme and revel with the dead.

6.

  Why not? since through life's little day
    Our heads such sad effects produce;
  Redeem'd from worms and wasting clay,
    This chance is theirs, to be of use.

WELL! THOU ART HAPPY.  

1.

  Well! thou art happy, and I feel
    That I should thus be happy too;
  For still my heart regards thy weal
    Warmly, as it was wont to do.

2.

  Thy husband's blest--and 'twill impart
    Some pangs to view his happier lot: 
  But let them pass--Oh! how my heart
    Would hate him if he loved thee not!

3.

  When late I saw thy favourite child,
    I thought my jealous heart would break;
  But when the unconscious infant smil'd,
    I kiss'd it for its mother's sake.

4.

  I kiss'd it,--and repress'd my sighs
    Its father in its face to see;
  But then it had its mother's eyes,
    And they were all to love and me.

5. 

  Mary, adieu! I must away:
    While thou art blest I'll not repine;
  But near thee I can never stay;
    My heart would soon again be thine.

6.

  I deem'd that Time, I deem'd that Pride,
    Had quench'd at length my boyish flame;
  Nor knew, till seated by thy side,
    My heart in all,--save hope,--the same.

7.

  Yet was I calm: I knew the time
    My breast would thrill before thy look;
  But now to tremble were a crime--
    We met,--and not a nerve was shook.

8.

  I saw thee gaze upon my face,
    Yet meet with no confusion there:
  One only feeling couldst thou trace;
    The sullen calmness of despair.

9.

  Away! away! my early dream
    Remembrance never must awake:
  Oh! where is Lethe's fabled stream?
    My foolish heart be still, or break.

INSCRIPTION ON THE MONUMENT OF A NEWFOUNDLAND DOG. 

  When some proud son of man returns to earth,
  Unknown to glory, but upheld by birth,
  The sculptor's art exhausts the pomp of woe
  And storied urns record who rest below:
  When all is done, upon the tomb is seen,
  Not what he was, but what he should have been:
  But the poor dog, in life the firmest friend,
  The first to welcome, foremost to defend,
  Whose honest heart is still his master's own,
  Who labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone,
  Unhonour'd falls, unnoticed all his worth--
  Denied in heaven the soul he held on earth:
  While Man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven,
  And claims himself a sole exclusive Heaven.
  Oh Man! thou feeble tenant of an hour,
  Debased by slavery, or corrupt by power,
  Who knows thee well must quit thee with disgust,
  Degraded mass of animated dust!
  Thy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat,
  Thy smiles hypocrisy, thy words deceit!
  By nature vile, ennobled but by name,
  Each kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame.
  Ye! who perchance behold this simple urn,
  Pass on--it honours none you wish to mourn:
  To mark a Friend's remains these stones arise;
  I never knew but one,--and here he lies. 

TO A LADY, 

ON BEING ASKED MY REASON FOR QUITTING ENGLAND IN THE SPRING. 

1.

  When Man, expell'd from Eden's bowers,
    A moment linger'd near the gate,
  Each scene recall'd the vanish'd hours,
    And bade him curse his future fate.

2.

  But, wandering on through distant climes,
    He learnt to bear his load of grief;
  Just gave a sigh to other times,
    And found in busier scenes relief.

3.

  Thus, Lady! will it be with me, 
    And I must view thy charms no more;
  For, while I linger near to thee,
    I sigh for all I knew before.

4.

  In flight I shall be surely wise,
    Escaping from temptation's snare:
  I cannot view my Paradise
    Without the wish of dwelling there.  

FILL THE GOBLET AGAIN. 

A SONG.

1.

  Fill the goblet again! for I never before
  Felt the glow which now gladdens my heart to its core;
  Let us drink!--who would not?--since, through life's varied round,
  In the goblet alone no deception is found.

2.

  I have tried in its turn all that life can supply;
  I have bask'd in the beam of a dark rolling eye;
  I have lov'd!--who has not?--but what heart can declare
  That Pleasure existed while Passion was there?

3.

  In the days of my youth, when the heart's in its spring,
  And dreams that Affection can never take wing,
  I had friends!--who has not?--but what tongue will avow,
  That friends, rosy wine! are so faithful as thou?

4.

  The heart of a mistress some boy may estrange,
  Friendship shifts with the sunbeam--thou never canst change;
  Thou grow'st old--who does not?--but on earth what appears,
  Whose virtues, like thine, still increase with its years?

5.

  Yet if blest to the utmost that Love can bestow,
  Should a rival bow down to our idol below,
  We are jealous!--who's not?--thou hast no such alloy;
  For the more that enjoy thee, the more we enjoy.

6.

  Then the season of youth and its vanities past,
  For refuge we fly to the goblet at last;
  There we find--do we not?--in the flow of the soul,
  That truth, as of yore, is confined to the bowl.

7.

  When the box of Pandora was open'd on earth,
  And Misery's triumph commenc'd over Mirth,
  Hope was left,--was she not?--but the goblet we kiss,
  And care not for Hope, who are certain of bliss.

8.

  Long life to the grape! for when summer is flown,
  The age of our nectar shall gladden our own:
  We must die--who shall not?--May our sins be forgiven,
  And Hebe shall never be idle in Heaven.

STANZAS TO A LADY, ON LEAVING ENGLAND. 

1.

  Tis done--and shivering in the gale
  The bark unfurls her snowy sail;
  And whistling o'er the bending mast,
  Loud sings on high the fresh'ning blast;
  And I must from this land be gone,
  Because I cannot love but one.

2.

  But could I be what I have been,
  And could I see what I have seen--
  Could I repose upon the breast
  Which once my warmest wishes blest--
  I should not seek another zone,
  Because I cannot love but one.

3.

  'Tis long since I beheld that eye
  Which gave me bliss or misery;
  And I have striven, but in vain,
  Never to think of it again:
  For though I fly from Albion,
  I still can only love but one.

4.

  As some lone bird, without a mate,
  My weary heart is desolate;
  I look around, and cannot trace
  One friendly smile or welcome face,
  And ev'n in crowds am still alone,
  Because I cannot love but one.

5.

  And I will cross the whitening foam,
  And I will seek a foreign home;
  Till I forget a false fair face,
  I ne'er shall find a resting-place;
  My own dark thoughts I cannot shun,
  But ever love, and love but one.

6.

  The poorest, veriest wretch on earth
  Still finds some hospitable hearth,
  Where Friendship's or Love's softer glow
  May smile in joy or soothe in woe;
  But friend or leman I have none, 
  Because I cannot love but one.

7.

  I go--but wheresoe'er I flee
  There's not an eye will weep for me;
  There's not a kind congenial heart,
  Where I can claim the meanest part;
  Nor thou, who hast my hopes undone,
  Wilt sigh, although I love but one.

8.

  To think of every early scene,
  Of what we are, and what we've been,
  Would whelm some softer hearts with woe--
  But mine, alas! has stood the blow;
  Yet still beats on as it begun,
  And never truly loves but one.

9.

  And who that dear lov'd one may be,
  Is not for vulgar eyes to see;
  And why that early love was cross'd,
  Thou know'st the best, I feel the most;
  But few that dwell beneath the sun
  Have loved so long, and loved but one.

10.

  I've tried another's fetters too,
  With charms perchance as fair to view;
  And I would fain have loved as well,
  But some unconquerable spell
  Forbade my bleeding breast to own
  A kindred care for aught but one.

11.

  'Twould soothe to take one lingering view,
  And bless thee in my last adieu;
  Yet wish I not those eyes to weep
  For him that wanders o'er the deep;
  His home, his hope, his youth are gone, 
  Yet still he loves, and loves but one. 

ENGLISH BARDS, AND SCOTCH REVIEWERS;

A SATIRE.

    "I had rather be a kitten, and cry, mew!
    Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers."

    SHAKESPEARE.

    "Such shameless Bards we have; and yet 'tis true,
    There are as mad, abandon'd Critics, too."

    POPE.

  Still  must I hear?--shall hoarse  FITZGERALD bawl
  His creaking couplets in a tavern hall,
  And I not sing, lest, haply, Scotch Reviews
  Should dub me scribbler, and denounce my Muse?
  Prepare for rhyme--I'll publish, right or wrong:
  Fools are my theme, let Satire be my song. 

    Oh! Nature's noblest gift--my grey goose-quill!
  Slave of my thoughts, obedient to my will,
  Torn from thy parent bird to form a pen,
  That mighty instrument of little men!
  The pen! foredoomed to aid the mental throes
  Of brains that labour, big with Verse or Prose;
  Though Nymphs forsake, and Critics may deride,
  The Lover's solace, and the Author's pride.
  What Wits! what Poets dost thou daily raise!
  How frequent is thy use, how small thy praise!
  Condemned at length to be forgotten quite,
  With all the pages which 'twas thine to write.
  But thou, at least, mine own especial pen! 
  Once laid aside, but now assumed again,
  Our task complete, like Hamet's  shall be free;
  Though spurned by others, yet beloved by me:
  Then let us soar to-day; no common theme,
  No Eastern vision, no distempered dream 
  Inspires--our path, though full of thorns, is plain;
  Smooth be the verse, and easy be the strain.

    When Vice triumphant holds her sov'reign sway,
  Obey'd by all who nought beside obey; 
  When Folly, frequent harbinger of crime,
  Bedecks her cap with bells of every Clime;
  When knaves and fools combined o'er all prevail,
  And weigh their Justice in a Golden Scale; 
  E'en then the boldest start from public sneers,
  Afraid of Shame, unknown to other fears,
  More darkly sin, by Satire kept in awe,
  And shrink from Ridicule, though not from Law.

    Such is the force of Wit! I but not belong
  To me the arrows of satiric song;
  The royal vices of our age demand
  A keener weapon, and a mightier hand.
  Still there are follies, e'en for me to chase,
  And yield at least amusement in the race:
  Laugh when I laugh, I seek no other fame,
  The cry is up, and scribblers are my game:
  Speed, Pegasus!--ye strains of great and small,
  Ode! Epic! Elegy!--have at you all!
  I, too, can scrawl, and once upon a time
  I poured along the town a flood of rhyme,
  A schoolboy freak, unworthy praise or blame;
  I printed--older children do the same.
  'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print;
  A Book's a Book, altho' there's nothing in't.
  Not that a Title's sounding charm can save 
  Or scrawl or scribbler from an equal grave:
  This LAMB  must own, since his patrician name
  Failed to preserve the spurious Farce from shame. 
  No matter, GEORGE continues still to write, 
  Tho' now the name is veiled from public sight.
  Moved by the great example, I pursue
  The self-same road, but make my own review:
  Not seek great JEFFREY'S, yet like him will be
  Self-constituted Judge of Poesy.

    A man must serve his time to every trade
  Save Censure--Critics all are ready made.
  Take hackneyed jokes from MILLER,  got by rote,
  With just enough of learning to misquote;
  A man well skilled to find, or forge a fault;
  A turn for punning--call it Attic salt;
  To JEFFREY go, be silent and discreet,
  His pay is just ten sterling pounds per sheet:
  Fear not to lie,'twill seem a sharper hit; 
  Shrink not from blasphemy, 'twill pass for wit;
  Care not for feeling--pass your proper jest,
  And stand a Critic, hated yet caress'd.

  And shall we own such judgment? no--as soon
  Seek roses in December--ice in June;
  Hope constancy in wind, or corn in chaff,
  Believe a woman or an epitaph,
  Or any other thing that's false, before
  You trust in Critics, who themselves are sore;
  Or yield one single thought to be misled
  By JEFFREY'S heart, or LAMB'S Boeotian head. 
  To these young tyrants, by themselves misplaced,
  Combined usurpers on the Throne of Taste;
  To these, when Authors bend in humble awe,
  And hail their voice as Truth, their word as Law;
  While these are Censors, 'twould be sin to spare; 
  While such are Critics, why should I forbear?
  But yet, so near all modern worthies run,
  'Tis doubtful whom to seek, or whom to shun;
  Nor know we when to spare, or where to strike,
  Our Bards and Censors are so much alike.
  Then should you ask me,  why I venture o'er
  The path which POPE and GIFFORD  trod before;
  If not yet sickened, you can still proceed;
  Go on; my rhyme will tell you as you read.
  "But hold!" exclaims a friend,--"here's some neglect:
  This--that--and t'other line seem incorrect."
  What then? the self-same blunder Pope has got,
  And careless Dryden--"Aye, but Pye has not:"--
  Indeed!--'tis granted, faith!--but what care I?
  Better to err with POPE, than shine with PYE. 

    Time was, ere yet in these degenerate days 
  Ignoble themes obtained mistaken praise,
  When Sense and Wit with Poesy allied,
  No fabled Graces, flourished side by side,
  From the same fount their inspiration drew,
  And, reared by Taste, bloomed fairer as they grew.
  Then, in this happy Isle, a POPE'S pure strain
  Sought the rapt soul to charm, nor sought in vain;
  A polished nation's praise aspired to claim,
  And raised the people's, as the poet's fame.
  Like him great DRYDEN poured the tide of song,
  In stream less smooth, indeed, yet doubly strong.
  Then CONGREVE'S scenes could cheer, or OTWAY'S melt; 
  For Nature then an English audience felt--
  But why these names, or greater still, retrace,
  When all to feebler Bards resign their place?
  Yet to such times our lingering looks are cast,
  When taste and reason with those times are past.
  Now look around, and turn each trifling page,
  Survey the precious works that please the age;
  This truth at least let Satire's self allow,
  No dearth of Bards can be complained of now. 
  The loaded Press beneath her labour groans, 
  And Printers' devils shake their weary bones;
  While SOUTHEY'S Epics cram the creaking shelves, 
  And LITTLE'S Lyrics shine in hot-pressed twelves. 
  Thus saith the Preacher: "Nought beneath the sun
  Is new,"  yet still from change to change we run.
  What varied wonders tempt us as they pass!
  The Cow-pox, Tractors, Galvanism, and Gas, 
  In turns appear, to make the vulgar stare,
  Till the swoln bubble bursts--and all is air!
  Nor less new schools of Poetry arise,
  Where dull pretenders grapple for the prize:
  O'er Taste awhile these Pseudo-bards prevail; 
  Each country Book-club bows the knee to Baal,
  And, hurling lawful Genius from the throne,
  Erects a shrine and idol of its own;
  Some leaden calf--but whom it matters not,
  From soaring SOUTHEY, down to groveling STOTT. 

    Behold! in various throngs the scribbling crew,
  For notice eager, pass in long review:
  Each spurs his jaded Pegasus apace,
  And Rhyme and Blank maintain an equal race;
  Sonnets on sonnets crowd, and ode on ode;
  And Tales of Terror  jostle on the road;
  Immeasurable measures move along;
  For simpering Folly loves a varied song,
  To strange, mysterious Dulness still the friend,
  Admires the strain she cannot comprehend.
  Thus Lays of Minstrels --may they be the last!--
  On half-strung harps whine mournful to the blast.
  While mountain spirits prate to river sprites,
  That dames may listen to the sound at nights;
  And goblin brats, of Gilpin Horner's  brood
  Decoy young Border-nobles through the wood,
  And skip at every step, Lord knows how high,
  And frighten foolish babes, the Lord knows why;
  While high-born ladies in their magic cell,
  Forbidding Knights to read who cannot spell,
  Despatch a courier to a wizard's grave,
  And fight with honest men to shield a knave.

    Next view in state, proud prancing on his roan,
  The golden-crested haughty Marmion,
  Now forging scrolls, now foremost in the fight,
  Not quite a Felon, yet but half a Knight. 
  The gibbet or the field prepared to grace;
  A mighty mixture of the great and base.
  And think'st thou, SCOTT! by vain conceit perchance,
  On public taste to foist thy stale romance,
  Though MURRAY with his MILLER may combine
  To yield thy muse just half-a-crown per line? 
  No! when the sons of song descend to trade,
  Their bays are sear, their former laurels fade,
  Let such forego the poet's sacred name,
  Who rack their brains for lucre, not for fame:
  Still for stern Mammon may they toil in vain! 
  And sadly gaze on Gold they cannot gain!
  Such be their meed, such still the just reward 
  Of prostituted Muse and hireling bard!
  For this we spurn Apollo's venal son,
  And bid a long "good night to Marmion." 

    These are the themes that claim our plaudits now;
  These are the Bards to whom the Muse must bow;
  While MILTON, DRYDEN, POPE, alike forgot,
  Resign their hallowed Bays to WALTER SCOTT.

    The time has been, when yet the Muse was young,
  When HOMER swept the lyre, and MARO sung,
  An Epic scarce ten centuries could claim,
  While awe-struck nations hailed the magic name:
  The work of each immortal Bard appears
  The single wonder of a thousand years. 
  Empires have mouldered from the face of earth,
  Tongues have expired with those who gave them birth,
  Without the glory such a strain can give,
  As even in ruin bids the language live.
  Not so with us, though minor Bards, content, 
  On one great work a life of labour spent:
  With eagle pinion soaring to the skies,
  Behold the Ballad-monger SOUTHEY rise!
  To him let CAMOENS, MILTON, TASSO yield,
  Whose annual strains, like armies, take the field.
  First in the ranks see Joan of Arc advance,
  The scourge of England and the boast of France!
  Though burnt by wicked BEDFORD for a witch,
  Behold her statue placed in Glory's niche;
  Her fetters burst, and just released from prison,
  A virgin Phoenix from her ashes risen.
  Next see tremendous Thalaba come on, 
  Arabia's monstrous, wild, and wond'rous son;
  Domdaniel's dread destroyer, who o'erthrew
  More mad magicians than the world e'er knew.
  Immortal Hero! all thy foes o'ercome,
  For ever reign--the rival of Tom Thumb! 
  Since startled Metre fled before thy face,
  Well wert thou doomed the last of all thy race!
  Well might triumphant Genii bear thee hence,
  Illustrious conqueror of common sense!
  Now, last and greatest, Madoc spreads his sails,
  Cacique in Mexico,  and Prince in Wales;
  Tells us strange tales, as other travellers do,
  More old than Mandeville's, and not so true.
  Oh, SOUTHEY! SOUTHEY!  cease thy varied song!
  A bard may chaunt too often and too long:
  As thou art strong in verse, in mercy, spare!
  A fourth, alas! were more than we could bear.
  But if, in spite of all the world can say,
  Thou still wilt verseward plod thy weary way;
  If still in Berkeley-Ballads most uncivil,
  Thou wilt devote old women to the devil, 
  The babe unborn thy dread intent may rue:
  "God help thee," SOUTHEY,  and thy readers too.

    Next comes the dull disciple of thy school, 
  That mild apostate from poetic rule,
  The simple WORDSWORTH, framer of a lay
  As soft as evening in his favourite May,
  Who warns his friend "to shake off toil and trouble,
  And quit his books, for fear of growing double;"
  Who, both by precept and example, shows
  That prose is verse, and verse is merely prose;
  Convincing all, by demonstration plain,
  Poetic souls delight in prose insane;
  And Christmas stories tortured into rhyme
  Contain the essence of the true sublime.
  Thus, when he tells the tale of Betty Foy,
  The idiot mother of "an idiot Boy;"
  A moon-struck, silly lad, who lost his way,
  And, like his bard, confounded night with day
  So close on each pathetic part he dwells,
  And each adventure so sublimely tells,
  That all who view the "idiot in his glory"
  Conceive the Bard the hero of the story.

    Shall gentle COLERIDGE pass unnoticed here, 
  To turgid ode and tumid stanza dear?
  Though themes of innocence amuse him best,
  Yet still Obscurity's a welcome guest.
  If Inspiration should her aid refuse
  To him who takes a Pixy for a muse,
  Yet none in lofty numbers can surpass
  The bard who soars to elegize an ass:
  So well the subject suits his noble mind, 
  He brays, the Laureate of the long-eared kind. 

  Oh! wonder-working LEWIS!  Monk, or Bard,
  Who fain would make Parnassus a church-yard! 
  Lo! wreaths of yew, not laurel, bind thy brow,
  Thy Muse a Sprite, Apollo's sexton thou!
  Whether on ancient tombs thou tak'st thy stand,
  By gibb'ring spectres hailed, thy kindred band;
  Or tracest chaste descriptions on thy page,
  To please the females of our modest age;
  All hail, M.P.!  from whose infernal brain
  Thin-sheeted phantoms glide, a grisly train;
  At whose command "grim women" throng in crowds,
  And kings of fire, of water, and of clouds,
  With "small grey men,"--"wild yagers," and what not,
  To crown with honour thee and WALTER SCOTT:
  Again, all hail! if tales like thine may please,
  St. Luke alone can vanquish the disease:
  Even Satan's self with thee might dread to dwell,
  And in thy skull discern a deeper Hell.

  Who in soft guise, surrounded by a choir
  Of virgins melting, not to Vesta's fire,
  With sparkling eyes, and cheek by passion flushed
  Strikes his wild lyre, whilst listening dames are hushed?
  'Tis LITTLE! young Catullus of his day,
  As sweet, but as immoral, in his Lay!
  Grieved to condemn, the Muse must still be just,
  Nor spare melodious advocates of lust.
  Pure is the flame which o'er her altar burns;
  From grosser incense with disgust she turns
  Yet kind to youth, this expiation o'er,
  She bids thee "mend thy line, and sin no more." 

  For thee, translator of the tinsel song,
  To whom such glittering ornaments belong,
  Hibernian STRANGFORD! with thine eyes of blue, 
  And boasted locks of red or auburn hue,
  Whose plaintive strain each love-sick Miss admires,
  And o'er harmonious fustian half expires,
  Learn, if thou canst, to yield thine author's sense,
  Nor vend thy sonnets on a false pretence.
  Think'st thou to gain thy verse a higher place,
  By dressing Camoens  in a suit of lace?
  Mend, STRANGFORD! mend thy morals and thy taste;
  Be warm, but pure; be amorous, but be chaste:
  Cease to deceive; thy pilfered harp restore,
  Nor teach the Lusian Bard to copy MOORE.

  Behold--Ye Tarts!--one moment spare the text! --
  HAYLEY'S last work, and worst--until his next;
  Whether he spin poor couplets into plays,
  Or damn the dead with purgatorial praise, 
  His style in youth or age is still the same,
  For ever feeble and for ever tame.
  Triumphant first see "Temper's Triumphs" shine!
  At least I'm sure they triumphed over mine.
  Of "Music's Triumphs," all who read may swear
  That luckless Music never triumph'd there. 

  Moravians, rise! bestow some meet reward 
  On dull devotion--Lo! the Sabbath Bard,
  Sepulchral GRAHAME,  pours his notes sublime
  In mangled prose, nor e'en aspires to rhyme;
  Breaks into blank the Gospel of St. Luke, 
  And boldly pilfers from the Pentateuch;
  And, undisturbed by conscientious qualms,
  Perverts the Prophets, and purloins the Psalms.

    Hail, Sympathy! thy soft idea brings" 
  A thousand visions of a thousand things,
  And shows, still whimpering thro' threescore of years, 
  The maudlin prince of mournful sonneteers.
  And art thou not their prince, harmonious Bowles! 
  Thou first, great oracle of tender souls?
  Whether them sing'st with equal ease, and grief, 
  The fall of empires, or a yellow leaf;
  Whether thy muse most lamentably tells
  What merry sounds proceed from Oxford bells, 
  Or, still in bells delighting, finds a friend
  In every chime that jingled from Ostend;
  Ah! how much juster were thy Muse's hap,
  If to thy bells thou would'st but add a cap!
  Delightful BOWLES! still blessing and still blest,
  All love thy strain, but children like it best.
  'Tis thine, with gentle LITTLE'S moral song,
  To soothe the mania of the amorous throng!
  With thee our nursery damsels shed their tears,
  Ere Miss as yet completes her infant years:
  But in her teens thy whining powers are vain;
  She quits poor BOWLES for LITTLE'S purer strain.
  Now to soft themes thou scornest to confine 
  The lofty numbers of a harp like thine;
  "Awake a louder and a loftier strain," 
  Such as none heard before, or will again!
  Where all discoveries jumbled from the flood,
  Since first the leaky ark reposed in mud,
  By more or less, are sung in every book,
  From Captain Noah down to Captain Cook.
  Nor this alone--but, pausing on the road,
  The Bard sighs forth a gentle episode,  
  And gravely tells--attend, each beauteous Miss!--
  When first Madeira trembled to a kiss.
  Bowles! in thy memory let this precept dwell,
  Stick to thy Sonnets, Man!--at least they sell.
  But if some new-born whim, or larger bribe,
  Prompt thy crude brain, and claim thee for a scribe:
  If 'chance some bard, though once by dunces feared,
  Now, prone in dust, can only be revered;
  If Pope, whose fame and genius, from the first, 
  Have foiled the best of critics, needs the worst,
  Do thou essay: each fault, each failing scan;
  The first of poets was, alas! but man.
  Rake from each ancient dunghill ev'ry pearl,
  Consult Lord Fanny, and confide in CURLL; 
  Let all the scandals of a former age
  Perch on thy pen, and flutter o'er thy page;
  Affect a candour which thou canst not feel,
  Clothe envy in a garb of honest zeal;
  Write, as if St. John's soul could still inspire,
  And do from hate what MALLET  did for hire.
  Oh! hadst thou lived in that congenial time,
  To rave with DENNIS, and with RALPH to rhyme;
  Thronged with the rest around his living head,
  Not raised thy hoof against the lion dead,
  A meet reward had crowned thy glorious gains,
  And linked thee to the Dunciad for thy pains. 

    Another Epic! Who inflicts again
  More books of blank upon the sons of men?
  Boeotian COTTLE, rich Bristowa's boast,
  Imports old stories from the Cambrian coast,
  And sends his goods to market--all alive!
  Lines forty thousand, Cantos twenty-five!
  Fresh fish from Hippocrene!  who'll buy? who'll buy?
  The precious bargain's cheap--in faith, not I.
  Your turtle-feeder's verse must needs be flat, 
  Though Bristol bloat him with the verdant fat;
  If Commerce fills the purse, she clogs the brain,
  And AMOS COTTLE strikes the Lyre in vain.
  In him an author's luckless lot behold!
  Condemned to make the books which once he sold.
  Oh, AMOS COTTLE!--Phoebus! what a name
  To fill the speaking-trump of future fame!--
  Oh, AMOS COTTLE! for a moment think
  What meagre profits spring from pen and ink!
  When thus devoted to poetic dreams,
  Who will peruse thy prostituted reams?
  Oh! pen perverted! paper misapplied!
  Had COTTLE  still adorned the counter's side,
  Bent o'er the desk, or, born to useful toils,
  Been taught to make the paper which he soils,
  Ploughed, delved, or plied the oar with lusty limb,
  He had not sung of Wales, nor I of him.

    As Sisyphus against the infernal steep
  Rolls the huge rock whose motions ne'er may sleep,
  So up thy hill, ambrosial Richmond! heaves
  Dull MAURICE  all his granite weight of leaves:
  Smooth, solid monuments of mental pain!
  The petrifactions of a plodding brain,
  That, ere they reach the top, fall lumbering back again.

    With broken lyre and cheek serenely pale,
  Lo! sad Alcaeus wanders down the vale;
  Though fair they rose, and might have bloomed at last,
  His hopes have perished by the northern blast:
  Nipped in the bud by Caledonian gales,
  His blossoms wither as the blast prevails!
  O'er his lost works let classic SHEFFIELD weep;
  May no rude hand disturb their early sleep! 

    Yet say! why should the Bard, at once, resign 
  His claim to favour from the sacred Nine?
  For ever startled by the mingled howl
  Of Northern Wolves, that still in darkness prowl;
  A coward Brood, which mangle as they prey,
  By hellish instinct, all that cross their way;
  Aged or young, the living or the dead," 
  No mercy find-these harpies must be fed.
  Why do the injured unresisting yield
  The calm possession of their native field?
  Why tamely thus before their fangs retreat,
  Nor hunt the blood-hounds back to Arthur's Seat? 

    Health to immortal JEFFREY! once, in name,
  England could boast a judge almost the same; 
  In soul so like, so merciful, yet just,
  Some think that Satan has resigned his trust,
  And given the Spirit to the world again,
  To sentence Letters, as he sentenced men.
  With hand less mighty, but with heart as black,
  With voice as willing to decree the rack;
  Bred in the Courts betimes, though all that law
  As yet hath taught him is to find a flaw,--
  Since well instructed in the patriot school
  To rail at party, though a party tool--
  Who knows? if chance his patrons should restore
  Back to the sway they forfeited before,
  His scribbling toils some recompense may meet,
  And raise this Daniel to the Judgment-Seat. 
  Let JEFFREY'S shade indulge the pious hope,
  And greeting thus, present him with a rope:
  "Heir to my virtues! man of equal mind!
  Skilled to condemn as to traduce mankind,
  This cord receive! for thee reserved with care,
  To wield in judgment, and at length to wear."

    Health to great JEFFREY! Heaven preserve his life,
  To flourish on the fertile shores of Fife,
  And guard it sacred in its future wars,
  Since authors sometimes seek the field of Mars!
  Can none remember that eventful day,  
  That ever-glorious, almost fatal fray,
  When LITTLE'S leadless pistol met his eye, 
  And Bow-street Myrmidons stood laughing by?
  Oh, day disastrous! on her firm-set rock,
  Dunedin's castle felt a secret shock;
  Dark rolled the sympathetic waves of Forth,
  Low groaned the startled whirlwinds of the north;
  TWEED ruffled half his waves to form a tear,
  The other half pursued his calm career; 
  ARTHUR'S steep summit nodded to its base,
  The surly Tolbooth scarcely kept her place.
  The Tolbooth felt--for marble sometimes can,
  On such occasions, feel as much as man--
  The Tolbooth felt defrauded of his charms,
  If JEFFREY died, except within her arms: 
  Nay last, not least, on that portentous morn,
  The sixteenth story, where himself was born,
  His patrimonial garret, fell to ground,
  And pale Edina shuddered at the sound:
  Strewed were the streets around with milk-white reams,
  Flowed all the Canongate with inky streams;
  This of his candour seemed the sable dew,
  That of his valour showed the bloodless hue;
  And all with justice deemed the two combined
  The mingled emblems of his mighty mind.
  But Caledonia's goddess hovered o'er
  The field, and saved him from the wrath of Moore;
  From either pistol snatched the vengeful lead,
  And straight restored it to her favourite's head;
  That head, with greater than magnetic power,
  Caught it, as Danae caught the golden shower,
  And, though the thickening dross will scarce refine,
  Augments its ore, and is itself a mine.
  "My son," she cried, "ne'er thirst for gore again,
  Resign the pistol and resume the pen;
  O'er politics and poesy preside,
  Boast of thy country, and Britannia's guide!
  For long as Albion's heedless sons submit,
  Or Scottish taste decides on English wit,
  So long shall last thine unmolested reign,
  Nor any dare to take thy name in vain.
  Behold, a chosen band shall aid thy plan,
  And own thee chieftain of the critic clan.
  First in the oat-fed phalanx  shall be seen
  The travelled Thane, Athenian Aberdeen. 
  HERBERT shall wield THOR'S hammer,  and sometimes
  In gratitude, thou'lt praise his rugged rhymes.
  Smug SYDNEY  too thy bitter page shall seek,
  And classic HALLAM,  much renowned for Greek;
  SCOTT may perchance his name and influence lend,
  And paltry PILLANS  shall traduce his friend;
  While gay Thalia's luckless votary, LAMB,  
  Damned like the Devil--Devil-like will damn.
  Known be thy name! unbounded be thy sway!
  Thy HOLLAND'S banquets shall each toil repay!
  While grateful Britain yields the praise she owes
  To HOLLAND'S hirelings and to Learning's foes.
  Yet mark one caution ere thy next Review
  Spread its light wings of Saffron and of Blue,
  Beware lest blundering BROUGHAM  destroy the sale,
  Turn Beef to Bannocks, Cauliflowers to Kail."
  Thus having said, the kilted Goddess kist
  Her son, and vanished in a Scottish mist. 

    Then prosper, JEFFREY! pertest of the train 
  Whom Scotland pampers with her fiery grain!
  Whatever blessing waits a genuine Scot,
  In double portion swells thy glorious lot;
  For thee Edina culls her evening sweets,
  And showers their odours on thy candid sheets,
  Whose Hue and Fragrance to thy work adhere--
  This scents its pages, and that gilds its rear. 
  Lo! blushing Itch, coy nymph, enamoured grown,
  Forsakes the rest, and cleaves to thee alone,
  And, too unjust to other Pictish men,
  Enjoys thy person, and inspires thy pen!

  Illustrious HOLLAND! hard would be his lot,
  His hirelings mentioned, and himself forgot! 
  HOLLAND, with HENRY PETTY  at his back,
  The whipper-in and huntsman of the pack.
  Blest be the banquets spread at Holland House,
  Where Scotchmen feed, and Critics may carouse!
  Long, long beneath that hospitable roof 
  Shall Grub-street dine, while duns are kept aloof.
  See honest HALLAM  lay aside his fork,
  Resume his pen, review his Lordship's work,
  And, grateful for the dainties on his plate,
  Declare his landlord can at least translate! 
  Dunedin! view thy children with delight,
  They write for food--and feed because they write: 
  And lest, when heated with the unusual grape,
  Some glowing thoughts should to the press escape,
  And tinge with red the female reader's cheek,
  My lady skims the cream of each critique;
  Breathes o'er the page her purity of soul,
  Reforms each error, and refines the whole. 

    Now to the Drama turn--Oh! motley sight!
  What precious scenes the wondering eyes invite:
  Puns, and a Prince within a barrel pent,  
  And Dibdin's nonsense yield complete content. 
  Though now, thank Heaven! the Rosciomania's o'er. 
  And full-grown actors are endured once more;
  Yet what avail their vain attempts to please,
  While British critics suffer scenes like these;
  While REYNOLDS vents his "'dammes!'" "poohs!" and
     "zounds!"  
  And common-place and common sense confounds?
  While KENNEY'S  "World"--ah! where is KENNEY'S wit? --
  Tires the sad gallery, lulls the listless Pit;
  And BEAUMONT'S pilfered Caratach affords
  A tragedy complete in all but words? 
  Who but must mourn, while these are all the rage
  The degradation of our vaunted stage?
  Heavens! is all sense of shame and talent gone?
  Have we no living Bard of merit?--none?
  Awake, GEORGE COLMAN!  CUMBERLAND, awake!
  Ring the alarum bell! let folly quake!
  Oh! SHERIDAN! if aught can move thy pen,
  Let Comedy assume her throne again; 
  Abjure the mummery of German schools;
  Leave new Pizarros to translating fools; 
  Give, as thy last memorial to the age,
  One classic drama, and reform the stage.
  Gods! o'er those boards shall Folly rear her head,
  Where GARRICK trod, and SIDDONS lives to tread?  
  On those shall Farce display buffoonery's mask,
  And HOOK conceal his heroes in a cask? 
  Shall sapient managers new scenes produce
  From CHERRY,  SKEFFINGTON,  and Mother GOOSE?  
  While SHAKESPEARE, OTWAY, MASSINGER, forgot,
  On stalls must moulder, or in closets rot?
  Lo! with what pomp the daily prints proclaim
  The rival candidates for Attic fame!
  In grim array though LEWIS' spectres rise,
  Still SKEFFINGTON and GOOSE divide the prize.
  And sure 'great' Skeffington must claim our praise,
  For skirtless coats and skeletons of plays
  Renowned alike; whose genius ne'er confines
  Her flight to garnish Greenwood's gay designs;  
  Nor sleeps with "Sleeping Beauties," but anon
  In five facetious acts comes thundering on.
  While poor John Bull, bewildered with the scene,
  Stares, wondering what the devil it can mean;
  But as some hands applaud, a venal few!
  Rather than sleep, why John applauds it too.

    Such are we now. Ah! wherefore should we turn
  To what our fathers were, unless to mourn?
  Degenerate Britons! are ye dead to shame,
  Or, kind to dulness, do you fear to blame?
  Well may the nobles of our present race
  Watch each distortion of a NALDI'S face;
  Well may they smile on Italy's buffoons,
  And worship CATALANI's pantaloons, 
  Since their own Drama yields no fairer trace
  Of wit than puns, of humour than grimace. 

    Then let Ausonia, skill'd in every art
  To soften manners, but corrupt the heart,
  Pour her exotic follies o'er the town,
  To sanction Vice, and hunt Decorum down:
  Let wedded strumpets languish o'er DESHAYES,
  And bless the promise which his form displays;
  While Gayton bounds before th' enraptured looks
  Of hoary Marquises, and stripling Dukes:
  Let high-born lechers eye the lively Presle
  Twirl her light limbs, that spurn the needless veil;
  Let Angiolini bare her breast of snow,
  Wave the white arm, and point the pliant toe;
  Collini trill her love-inspiring song,
  Strain her fair neck, and charm the listening throng!
  Whet  not your scythe, Suppressors of our Vice!
  Reforming Saints! too delicately nice!
  By whose decrees, our sinful souls to save,
  No Sunday tankards foam, no barbers shave;
  And beer undrawn, and beards unmown, display
  Your holy reverence for the Sabbath-day.

    Or hail at once the patron and the pile
  Of vice and folly, Greville and Argyle! 
  Where yon proud palace, Fashion's hallow'd fane,
  Spreads wide her portals for the motley train,
  Behold the new Petronius  of the day, 
  Our arbiter of pleasure and of play!
  There the hired eunuch, the Hesperian choir,
  The melting lute, the soft lascivious lyre,
  The song from Italy, the step from France,
  The midnight orgy, and the mazy dance,
  The smile of beauty, and the flush of wine,
  For fops, fools, gamesters, knaves, and Lords combine:
  Each to his humour--Comus all allows;
  Champaign, dice, music, or your neighbour's spouse.
  Talk not to us, ye starving sons of trade!
  Of piteous ruin, which ourselves have made;
  In Plenty's sunshine Fortune's minions bask,
  Nor think of Poverty, except "en masque," 
  When for the night some lately titled ass
  Appears the beggar which his grandsire was,
  The curtain dropped, the gay Burletta o'er,
  The audience take their turn upon the floor:
  Now round the room the circling dow'gers sweep,
  Now in loose waltz the thin-clad daughters leap;
  The first in lengthened line majestic swim,
  The last display the free unfettered limb!
  Those for Hibernia's lusty sons repair
  With art the charms which Nature could not spare;
  These after husbands wing their eager flight,
  Nor leave much mystery for the nuptial night.

    Oh! blest retreats of infamy and ease,
  Where, all forgotten but the power to please,
  Each maid may give a loose to genial thought,
  Each swain may teach new systems, or be taught:
  There the blithe youngster, just returned from Spain,
  Cuts the light pack, or calls the rattling main;
  The jovial Caster's set, and seven's the Nick,
  Or--done!--a thousand on the coming trick!
  If, mad with loss, existence 'gins to tire,
  And all your hope or wish is to expire,
  Here's POWELL'S  pistol ready for your life,
  And, kinder still, two PAGETS for your wife: 
  Fit consummation of an earthly race
  Begun in folly, ended in disgrace,
  While none but menials o'er the bed of death,
  Wash thy red wounds, or watch thy wavering breath;
  Traduced by liars, and forgot by all,
  The mangled victim of a drunken brawl,
  To live like CLODIUS,  and like FALKLAND fall.

    Truth! rouse some genuine Bard, and guide his hand
  To drive this pestilence from out the land.
  E'en I--least thinking of a thoughtless throng,
  Just skilled to know the right and choose the wrong,
  Freed at that age when Reason's shield is lost,
  To fight my course through Passion's countless host, 
  Whom every path of Pleasure's flow'ry way
  Has lured in turn, and all have led astray--
  E'en I must raise my voice, e'en I must feel
  Such scenes, such men, destroy the public weal:
  Altho' some kind, censorious friend will say,
  "What art thou better, meddling fool,  than they?"
  And every Brother Rake will smile to see
  That miracle, a Moralist in me.
  No matter--when some Bard in virtue strong,
  Gifford perchance, shall raise the chastening song,
  Then sleep my pen for ever! and my voice
  Be only heard to hail him, and rejoice,
  Rejoice, and yield my feeble praise, though I
  May feel the lash that Virtue must apply.

    As for the smaller fry, who swarm in shoals
  From silly HAFIZ up to simple BOWLES, 
  Why should we call them from their dark abode,
  In Broad St. Giles's or Tottenham-Road?
  Or (since some men of fashion nobly dare
  To scrawl in verse) from Bond-street or the Square? 
  If things of Ton their harmless lays indite,
  Most wisely doomed to shun the public sight,
  What harm? in spite of every critic elf,
  Sir T. may read his stanzas to himself;
  MILES ANDREWS  still his strength in couplets try,
  And live in prologues, though his dramas die.
  Lords too are Bards: such things at times befall,
  And 'tis some praise in Peers to write at all.
  Yet, did or Taste or Reason sway the times,
  Ah! who would take their titles with their rhymes? 
  ROSCOMMON!  SHEFFIELD!  with your spirits fled, 
  No future laurels deck a noble head;
  No Muse will cheer, with renovating smile,
  The paralytic puling of CARLISLE.  
  The puny schoolboy and his early lay
  Men pardon, if his follies pass away;
  But who forgives the Senior's ceaseless verse,
  Whose hairs grow hoary as his rhymes grow worse?
  What heterogeneous honours deck the Peer!
  Lord, rhymester, petit-maitre, pamphleteer! 
  So dull in youth, so drivelling in his age,
  His scenes alone had damned our sinking stage;
  But Managers for once cried, "Hold, enough!"
  Nor drugged their audience with the tragic stuff.
  Yet at their judgment let his Lordship laugh, 
  And case his volumes in congenial calf;
  Yes! doff that covering, where Morocco shines,
  And hang a calf-skin on those recreant lines.

    With you, ye Druids! rich in native lead,
  Who daily scribble for your daily bread:
  With you I war not: GIFFORD'S heavy hand
  Has crushed, without remorse, your numerous band.
  On "All the Talents" vent your venal spleen; 
  Want is your plea, let Pity be your screen.
  Let Monodies on Fox regale your crew,
  And Melville's Mantle  prove a Blanket too!
  One common Lethe waits each hapless Bard,
  And, peace be with you! 'tis your best reward.
  Such damning fame; as Dunciads only give 
  Could bid your lines beyond a morning live;
  But now at once your fleeting labours close,
  With names of greater note in blest repose.
  Far be't from me unkindly to upbraid
  The lovely ROSA'S prose in masquerade,
  Whose strains, the faithful echoes of her mind,
  Leave wondering comprehension far behind. 
  Though Crusca's bards no more our journals fill, 
  Some stragglers skirmish round the columns still;
  Last of the howling host which once was Bell's, 
  Matilda snivels yet, and Hafiz yells;
  And Merry's  metaphors appear anew,
  Chained to the signature of O. P. Q. 
  When some brisk youth, the tenant of a stall,
  Employs a pen less pointed than his awl,
  Leaves his snug shop, forsakes his store of shoes,
  St. Crispin quits, and cobbles for the Muse,
  Heavens! how the vulgar stare! how crowds applaud!
  How ladies read, and Literati laud!
  If chance some wicked wag should pass his jest,
  'Tis sheer ill-nature--don't the world know best?
  Genius must guide when wits admire the rhyme,
  And CAPEL LOFFT  declares 'tis quite sublime.
  Hear, then, ye happy sons of needless trade!
  Swains! quit the plough, resign the useless spade!
  Lo! BURNS and BLOOMFIELD, nay, a greater far,
  GIFFORD was born beneath an adverse star,
  Forsook the labours of a servile state,
  Stemmed the rude storm, and triumphed over Fate:
  Then why no more? if Phoebus smiled on you,
  BLOOMFIELD! why not on brother Nathan too? 
  Him too the Mania, not the Muse, has seized;
  Not inspiration, but a mind diseased:
  And now no Boor can seek his last abode,
  No common be inclosed without an ode.
  Oh! since increased refinement deigns to smile
  On Britain's sons, and bless our genial Isle,
  Let Poesy go forth, pervade the whole,
  Alike the rustic, and mechanic soul!
  Ye tuneful cobblers! still your notes prolong,
  Compose at once a slipper and a song;
  So shall the fair your handywork peruse,
  Your sonnets sure shall please--perhaps your shoes.
  May Moorland weavers  boast Pindaric skill,
  And tailors' lays be longer than their bill!
  While punctual beaux reward the grateful notes,
  And pay for poems--when they pay for coats.

    To the famed throng now paid the tribute due, 
  Neglected Genius! let me turn to you.
  Come forth, oh CAMPBELL! give thy talents scope;
  Who dares aspire if thou must cease to hope?
  And thou, melodious ROGERS! rise at last,
  Recall the pleasing memory of the past; 
  Arise! let blest remembrance still inspire,
  And strike to wonted tones thy hallowed lyre;
  Restore Apollo to his vacant throne,
  Assert thy country's honour and thine own.
  What! must deserted Poesy still weep
  Where her last hopes with pious COWPER sleep?
  Unless, perchance, from his cold bier she turns,
  To deck the turf that wraps her minstrel, BURNS!
  No! though contempt hath marked the spurious brood,
  The race who rhyme from folly, or for food,
  Yet still some genuine sons 'tis hers to boast,
  Who, least affecting, still affect the most: 
  Feel as they write, and write but as they feel--
  Bear witness GIFFORD,  SOTHEBY,  MACNEIL. 
  "Why slumbers GIFFORD?" once was asked in vain;
  Why slumbers GIFFORD? let us ask again.
  Are there no follies for his pen to purge?
  Are there no fools whose backs demand the scourge?
  Are there no sins for Satire's Bard to greet?
  Stalks not gigantic Vice in every street?
  Shall Peers or Princes tread pollution's path,
  And 'scape alike the Laws and Muse's wrath?
  Nor blaze with guilty glare through future time,
  Eternal beacons of consummate crime?
  Arouse thee, GIFFORD! be thy promise claimed,
  Make bad men better, or at least ashamed.

  Unhappy WHITE!  while life was in its spring,
  And thy young Muse just waved her joyous wing,
  The Spoiler swept that soaring Lyre away,  
  Which else had sounded an immortal lay.
  Oh! what a noble heart was here undone,
  When Science' self destroyed her favourite son!
  Yes, she too much indulged thy fond pursuit,
  She sowed the seeds, but Death has reaped the fruit.
  'Twas thine own Genius gave the final blow,
  And helped to plant the wound that laid thee low:
  So the struck Eagle, stretched upon the plain,
  No more through rolling clouds to soar again,
  Viewed his own feather on the fatal dart,
  And winged the shaft that quivered in his heart;
  Keen were his pangs, but keener far to feel
  He nursed the pinion which impelled the steel;
  While the same plumage that had warmed his nest
  Drank the last life-drop of his bleeding breast.

   There be who say, in these enlightened days,
  That splendid lies are all the poet's praise;
  That strained Invention, ever on the wing,
  Alone impels the modern Bard to sing:
  Tis true, that all who rhyme--nay, all who write,
  Shrink from that fatal word to Genius--Trite;
  Yet Truth sometimes will lend her noblest fires,
  And decorate the verse herself inspires:
  This fact in Virtue's name let CRABBE  attest;
  Though Nature's sternest Painter, yet the best.

    And here let SHEE  and Genius find a place,
  Whose pen and pencil yield an equal grace;
  To guide whose hand the sister Arts combine,
  And trace the Poet's or the Painter's line;
  Whose magic touch can bid the canvas glow,
  Or pour the easy rhyme's harmonious flow;
  While honours, doubly merited, attend 
  The Poet's rival, but the Painter's friend.

    Blest is the man who dares approach the bower
  Where dwelt the Muses at their natal hour;
  Whose steps have pressed, whose eye has marked afar,
  The clime that nursed the sons of song and war,
  The scenes which Glory still must hover o'er,
  Her place of birth, her own Achaian shore.
  But doubly blest is he whose heart expands
  With hallowed feelings for those classic lands;
  Who rends the veil of ages long gone by,
  And views their remnants with a poet's eye!
  WRIGHT!  'twas thy happy lot at once to view
  Those shores of glory, and to sing them too;
  And sure no common Muse inspired thy pen
  To hail the land of Gods and Godlike men.

    And you, associate Bards!  who snatched to light 
  Those gems too long withheld from modern sight;
  Whose mingling taste combined to cull the wreath
  While Attic flowers Aonian odours breathe,
  And all their renovated fragrance flung,
  To grace the beauties of your native tongue;
  Now let those minds, that nobly could transfuse
  The glorious Spirit of the Grecian Muse,
  Though soft the echo, scorn a borrowed tone: 
  Resign Achaia's lyre, and strike your own.

    Let these, or such as these, with just applause, 
  Restore the Muse's violated laws;
  But not in flimsy DARWIN'S  pompous chime, 
  That mighty master of unmeaning rhyme,
  Whose gilded cymbals, more adorned than clear,
  The eye delighted, but fatigued the ear,
  In show the simple lyre could once surpass,
  But now, worn down, appear in native brass;
  While all his train of hovering sylphs around
  Evaporate in similes and sound:
  Him let them shun, with him let tinsel die:
  False glare attracts, but more offends the eye. 

    Yet let them not to vulgar WORDSWORTH  stoop,
  The meanest object of the lowly group,
  Whose verse, of all but childish prattle void,
  Seems blessed harmony to LAMB and LLOYD: 
  Let them--but hold, my Muse, nor dare to teach
  A strain far, far beyond thy humble reach:
  The native genius with their being given
  Will point the path, and peal their notes to heaven.

    And thou, too, SCOTT!  resign to minstrels rude
  The wilder Slogan of a Border feud:
  Let others spin their meagre lines for hire;
  Enough for Genius, if itself inspire!
  Let SOUTHEY sing, altho' his teeming muse, 
  Prolific every spring, be too profuse;
  Let simple WORDSWORTH  chime his childish verse,
  And brother COLERIDGE lull the babe at nurse 
  Let Spectre-mongering LEWIS aim, at most, 
  To rouse the Galleries, or to raise a ghost;
  Let MOORE still sigh; let STRANGFORD steal from MOORE, 
  And swear that CAMOENS sang such notes of yore;
  Let HAYLEY hobble on, MONTGOMERY rave,
  And godly GRAHAME chant a stupid stave;
  Let sonneteering BOWLES  his strains refine,
  And whine and whimper to the fourteenth line;
  Let STOTT, CARLISLE,  MATILDA, and the rest
  Of Grub Street, and of Grosvenor Place the best,
  Scrawl on, 'till death release us from the strain,
  Or Common Sense assert her rights again;
  But Thou, with powers that mock the aid of praise,
  Should'st leave to humbler Bards ignoble lays:
  Thy country's voice, the voice of all the Nine,
  Demand a hallowed harp--that harp is thine.
  Say! will not Caledonia's annals yield
  The glorious record of some nobler field,
  Than the vile foray of a plundering clan,
  Whose proudest deeds disgrace the name of man?
  Or Marmion's acts of darkness, fitter food
  For SHERWOOD'S outlaw tales of ROBIN HOOD?
  Scotland! still proudly claim thy native Bard,
  And be thy praise his first, his best reward!
  Yet not with thee alone his name should live,
  But own the vast renown a world can give;
  Be known, perchance, when Albion is no more,
  And tell the tale of what she was before;
  To future times her faded fame recall,
  And save her glory, though his country fall.

    Yet what avails the sanguine Poet's hope,
  To conquer ages, and with time to cope?
  New eras spread their wings, new nations rise,
  And other Victors fill th' applauding skies; 
  A few brief generations fleet along,
  Whose sons forget the Poet and his song:
  E'en now, what once-loved Minstrels scarce may claim
  The transient mention of a dubious name!
  When Fame's loud trump hath blown its noblest blast,
  Though long the sound, the echo sleeps at last;
  And glory, like the Phoenix  midst her fires,
  Exhales her odours, blazes, and expires.

  Shall hoary Granta call her sable sons,
  Expert in science, more expert at puns?
  Shall these approach the Muse? ah, no! she flies,
  Even from the tempting ore of Seaton's prize; 
  Though Printers condescend the press to soil
  With rhyme by HOARE,  and epic blank by HOYLE:  
  Not him whose page, if still upheld by whist,
  Requires no sacred theme to bid us list. 
  Ye! who in Granta's honours would surpass,
  Must mount her Pegasus, a full-grown ass;
  A foal well worthy of her ancient Dam,
  Whose Helicon  is duller than her Cam. 

  There CLARKE,  still striving piteously "to please," 
  Forgetting doggerel leads not to degrees,
  A would-be satirist, a hired Buffoon,
  A monthly scribbler of some low Lampoon, 
  Condemned to drudge, the meanest of the mean,
  And furbish falsehoods for a magazine,
  Devotes to scandal his congenial mind;
  Himself a living libel on mankind.

  Oh! dark asylum of a Vandal race! 
  At once the boast of learning, and disgrace!
  So lost to Phoebus, that nor Hodgson's  verse
  Can make thee better, nor poor Hewson's  worse. 
  But where fair Isis rolls her purer wave,
  The partial Muse delighted loves to lave;
  On her green banks a greener wreath she wove, 
  To crown the Bards that haunt her classic grove;
  Where RICHARDS wakes a genuine poet's fires,
  And modern Britons glory in their Sires.

  For me, who, thus unasked, have dared to tell
  My country, what her sons should know too well, 
  Zeal for her honour bade me here engage 
  The host of idiots that infest her age;
  No just applause her honoured name shall lose,
  As first in freedom, dearest to the Muse.
  Oh! would thy bards but emulate thy fame,
  And rise more worthy, Albion, of thy name!
  What Athens was in science, Rome in power,
  What Tyre appeared in her meridian hour,
  'Tis thine at once, fair Albion! to have been--
  Earth's chief Dictatress, Ocean's lovely Queen: 
  But Rome decayed, and Athens strewed the plain,
  And Tyre's proud piers lie shattered in the main;
  Like these, thy strength may sink, in ruin hurled, 
  And Britain fall, the bulwark of the world.
  But let me cease, and dread Cassandra's fate,
  With warning ever scoffed at, till too late;
  To themes less lofty still my lay confine,
  And urge thy Bards to gain a name like thine.

    Then, hapless Britain! be thy rulers blest,
  The senate's oracles, the people's jest!
  Still hear thy motley orators dispense
  The flowers of rhetoric, though not of sense,
  While CANNING'S colleagues hate him for his wit,
  And old dame PORTLAND  fills the place of PITT.

    Yet once again, adieu! ere this the sail
  That wafts me hence is shivering in the gale;
  And Afric's coast and Calpe's adverse height, 
  And Stamboul's minarets must greet my sight:
  Thence shall I stray through Beauty's native clime, 
  Where Kaff  is clad in rocks, and crowned with snows sublime.
  But should I back return, no tempting press 
  Shall drag my Journal from the desk's recess;
  Let coxcombs, printing as they come from far,
  Snatch his own wreath of Ridicule from Carr;
  Let ABERDEEN and ELGIN  still pursue
  The shade of fame through regions of Virtu;
  Waste useless thousands on their Phidian freaks,
  Misshapen monuments and maimed antiques;
  And make their grand saloons a general mart
  For all the mutilated blocks of art:
  Of Dardan tours let Dilettanti tell,
  I leave topography to rapid  GELL; 
  And, quite content, no more shall interpose
  To stun the public ear--at least with Prose. 

    Thus far I've held my undisturbed career,
  Prepared for rancour, steeled 'gainst selfish fear;
  This thing of rhyme I ne'er disdained to own--
  Though not obtrusive, yet not quite unknown:
  My voice was heard again, though not so loud,
  My page, though nameless, never disavowed;
  And now at once I tear the veil away:--
  Cheer on the pack! the Quarry stands at bay,
  Unscared by all the din of MELBOURNE house, 
  By LAMB'S resentment, or by HOLLAND'S spouse,
  By JEFFREY'S harmless pistol, HALLAM'S rage,
  Edina's brawny sons and brimstone page.
  Our men in buckram shall have blows enough,
  And feel they too are "penetrable stuff:"
  And though I hope not hence unscathed to go,
  Who conquers me shall find a stubborn foe.
  The time hath been, when no harsh sound would fall
  From lips that now may seem imbued with gall;
  Nor fools nor follies tempt me to despise
  The meanest thing that crawled beneath my eyes:
  But now, so callous grown, so changed since youth,
  I've learned to think, and sternly speak the truth;
  Learned to deride the critic's starch decree,
  And break him on the wheel he meant for me;
  To spurn the rod a scribbler bids me kiss,
  Nor care if courts and crowds applaud or hiss:
  Nay more, though all my rival rhymesters frown,
  I too can hunt a Poetaster down;
  And, armed in proof, the gauntlet cast at once
  To Scotch marauder, and to Southern dunce.
  Thus much I've dared; if my incondite lay 
  Hath wronged these righteous times, let others say:
  This, let the world, which knows not how to spare,
  Yet rarely blames unjustly, now declare.

HINTS FROM  HORACE: 

BEING AN ALLUSION IN ENGLISH VERSE TO THE EPISTLE
"AD PISONES, DE ARTE POETICA,"
AND INTENDED AS A SEQUEL TO "ENGLISH BARDS, AND SCOTCH REVIEWERS."

 ----"Ergo fungar vice cotis, acutum
  Reddere quae ferrum valet, exsors ipsa secandi."

  HOR. 'De Arte Poet'., II. 304 and 305.

  "Rhymes are difficult things--they are stubborn things, Sir."

  FIELDING'S 'Amelia', Vol. iii. Book; and Chap. v.

  Who would not laugh, if Lawrence , hired to grace 
  His costly canvas with each flattered face,
  Abused his art, till Nature, with a blush,
  Saw cits grow Centaurs underneath his brush?
  Or, should some limner join, for show or sale,
  A Maid of Honour to a Mermaid's tail? 
  Or low Dubost --as once the world has seen--
  Degrade God's creatures in his graphic spleen?
  Not all that forced politeness, which defends
  Fools in their faults, could gag his grinning friends.
  Believe me, Moschus, like that picture seems 
  The book which, sillier than a sick man's dreams,
  Displays a crowd of figures incomplete,
  Poetic Nightmares, without head or feet.

    Poets and painters, as all artists know, 
  May shoot a little with a lengthened bow;
  We claim this mutual mercy for our task,
  And grant in turn the pardon which we ask;
  But make not monsters spring from gentle dams--
  Birds breed not vipers, tigers nurse not lambs.

    A laboured, long Exordium, sometimes tends
  (Like patriot speeches) but to paltry ends; 
  And nonsense in a lofty note goes down,
  As Pertness passes with a legal gown: 
  Thus many a Bard describes in pompous strain 
  The clear brook babbling through the goodly plain:
  The groves of Granta, and her Gothic halls,
  King's Coll-Cam's stream-stained windows, and old walls:
  Or, in adventurous numbers, neatly aims
  To paint a rainbow, or the river Thames.

    You sketch a tree, and so perhaps may shine --
  But daub a shipwreck like an alehouse sign;
  You plan a vase--it dwindles to a pot;
  Then glide down Grub-street--fasting and forgot:
  Laughed into Lethe by some quaint Review,
  Whose wit is never troublesome till--true.

  In fine, to whatsoever you aspire,
  Let it at least be simple and entire.

    The greater portion of the rhyming tribe 
  (Give ear, my friend, for thou hast been a scribe)
  Are led astray by some peculiar lure. 
  I labour to be brief--become obscure;
  One falls while following Elegance too fast;
  Another soars, inflated with Bombast;
  Too low a third crawls on, afraid to fly,
  He spins his subject to Satiety;
  Absurdly varying, he at last engraves
  Fish in the woods, and boars beneath the waves! 

    Unless your care's exact, your judgment nice,
  The flight from Folly leads but into Vice;
  None are complete, all wanting in some part,
  Like certain tailors, limited in art.
  For galligaskins Slowshears is your man 
  But coats must claim another artisan. 
  Now this to me, I own, seems much the same
  As Vulcan's feet to bear Apollo's frame;
  Or, with a fair complexion, to expose
  Black eyes, black ringlets, but--a bottle nose!

    Dear Authors! suit your topics to your strength,
  And ponder well your subject, and its length;
  Nor lift your load, before you're quite aware
  What weight your shoulders will, or will not, bear.
  But lucid Order, and Wit's siren voice, 
  Await the Poet, skilful in his choice;
  With native Eloquence he soars along,
  Grace in his thoughts, and Music in his song.

    Let Judgment teach him wisely to combine
  With future parts the now omitted line:
  This shall the Author choose, or that reject,
  Precise in style, and cautious to select;
  Nor slight applause will candid pens afford
  To him who furnishes a wanting word. 
  Then fear not, if 'tis needful, to produce
  Some term unknown, or obsolete in use,
  (As Pitt has furnished us a word or two, 
  Which Lexicographers declined to do;)
  So you indeed, with care,--(but be content
  To take this license rarely)--may invent.
  New words find credit in these latter days,
  If neatly grafted on a Gallic phrase;
  What Chaucer, Spenser did, we scarce refuse
  To Dryden's or to Pope's maturer Muse.
  If you can add a little, say why not,
  As well as William Pitt, and Walter Scott?
  Since they, by force of rhyme and force of lungs, 
  Enriched our Island's ill-united tongues;
  'Tis then--and shall be--lawful to present
  Reform in writing, as in Parliament.

    As forests shed their foliage by degrees,
  So fade expressions which in season please;
  And we and ours, alas! are due to Fate,
  And works and words but dwindle to a date.
  Though as a Monarch nods, and Commerce calls, 
  Impetuous rivers stagnate in canals;
  Though swamps subdued, and marshes drained, sustain 
  The heavy ploughshare and the yellow grain,
  And rising ports along the busy shore
  Protect the vessel from old Ocean's roar,
  All, all, must perish; but, surviving last,
  The love of Letters half preserves the past.
  True, some decay, yet not a few revive;  
  Though those shall sink, which now appear to thrive,
  As Custom arbitrates, whose shifting sway 
  Our life and language must alike obey.

    The immortal wars which Gods and Angels wage,
  Are they not shown in Milton's sacred page?
  His strain will teach what numbers best belong
  To themes celestial told in Epic song. 

    The slow, sad stanza will correctly paint
  The Lover's anguish, or the Friend's complaint.
  But which deserves the Laurel--Rhyme or Blank? 
  Which holds on Helicon the higher rank?
  Let squabbling critics by themselves dispute
  This point, as puzzling as a Chancery suit.

    Satiric rhyme first sprang from selfish spleen.
  You doubt--see Dryden, Pope, St. Patrick's Dean. 
  Blank verse is now, with one consent, allied
  To Tragedy, and rarely quits her side.
  Though mad Almanzor  rhymed in Dryden's days,
  No sing-song Hero rants in modern plays;
  Whilst modest Comedy her verse foregoes
  For jest and 'pun'  in very middling prose.
  Not that our Bens or Beaumonts show the worse,
  Or lose one point, because they wrote in verse.
  But so Thalia pleases to appear, 
  Poor Virgin! damned some twenty times a year!

  Whate'er the scene, let this advice have weight:--
  Adapt your language to your Hero's state.
  At times Melpomene forgets to groan,
  And brisk Thalia takes a serious tone;
  Nor unregarded will the act pass by
  Where angry Townly  "lifts his voice on high."
  Again, our Shakespeare limits verse to Kings,
  When common prose will serve for common things;
  And lively Hal resigns heroic ire, --
  To "hollaing Hotspur"  and his sceptred sire. 

    'Tis not enough, ye Bards, with all your art,
  To polish poems; they must touch the heart:
  Where'er the scene be laid, whate'er the song,
  Still let it bear the hearer's soul along;
  Command your audience or to smile or weep,
  Whiche'er may please you--anything but sleep.
  The Poet claims our tears; but, by his leave,
  Before I shed them, let me see 'him' grieve.

    If banished Romeo feigned nor sigh nor tear,
  Lulled by his languor, I could sleep or sneer. 
  Sad words, no doubt, become a serious face,
  And men look angry in the proper place.
  At double meanings folks seem wondrous sly,
  And Sentiment prescribes a pensive eye;
  For Nature formed at first the inward man,
  And actors copy Nature--when they can.
  She bids the beating heart with rapture bound,
  Raised to the Stars, or levelled with the ground;
  And for Expression's aid, 'tis said, or sung, 
  She gave our mind's interpreter--the tongue,
  Who, worn with use, of late would fain dispense
  (At least in theatres) with common sense;
  O'erwhelm with sound the Boxes, Gallery, Pit,
  And raise a laugh with anything--but Wit.

    To skilful writers it will much import,
  Whence spring their scenes, from common life or Court;
  Whether they seek applause by smile or tear,
  To draw a Lying Valet,  or a Lear, 
  A sage, or rakish youngster wild from school,
  A wandering Peregrine, or plain John Bull;
  All persons please when Nature's voice prevails,
  Scottish or Irish, born in Wilts or Wales.

    Or follow common fame, or forge a plot; 
  Who cares if mimic heroes lived or not!
  One precept serves to regulate the scene:
  Make it appear as if it might have been.

    If some Drawcansir  you aspire to draw,
  Present him raving, and above all law:
  If female furies in your scheme are planned,
  Macbeth's fierce dame is ready to your hand;
  For tears and treachery, for good and evil,
  Constance, King Richard, Hamlet, and the Devil!
  But if a new design you dare essay,
  And freely wander from the beaten way,
  True to your characters, till all be past,
  Preserve consistency from first to last.

    Tis hard  to venture where our betters fail, 
  Or lend fresh interest to a twice-told tale;
  And yet, perchance,'tis wiser to prefer
  A hackneyed plot, than choose a new, and err;
  Yet copy not too closely, but record,
  More justly, thought for thought than word for word;
  Nor trace your Prototype through narrow ways,
  But only follow where he merits praise.

    For you, young Bard! whom luckless fate may lead 
  To tremble on the nod of all who read,
  Ere your first score of cantos Time unrolls, 
  Beware--for God's sake, don't begin like Bowles!
  "Awake a louder and a loftier strain," --
  And pray, what follows from his boiling brain?--
  He sinks to Southey's level in a trice,
  Whose Epic Mountains never fail in mice!
  Not so of yore awoke your mighty Sire
  The tempered warblings of his master-lyre;
  Soft as the gentler breathing of the lute,
  "Of Man's first disobedience and the fruit"
  He speaks, but, as his subject swells along,
  Earth, Heaven, and Hades echo with the song."
  Still to the "midst of things" he hastens on,
  As if we witnessed all already done; 
  Leaves on his path whatever seems too mean
  To raise the subject, or adorn the scene;
  Gives, as each page improves upon the sight,
  Not smoke from brightness, but from darkness--light;
  And truth and fiction with such art compounds,
  We know not where to fix their several bounds.

    If you would please the Public, deign to hear
  What soothes the many-headed monster's ear: 
  If your heart triumph when the hands of all
  Applaud in thunder at the curtain's fall,
  Deserve those plaudits--study Nature's page,
  And sketch the striking traits of every age;
  While varying Man and varying years unfold
  Life's little tale, so oft, so vainly told;
  Observe his simple childhood's dawning days,
  His pranks, his prate, his playmates, and his plays:
  Till time at length the mannish tyro weans,
  And prurient vice outstrips his tardy teens! 

    Behold him Freshman! forced no more to groan 
  O'er Virgil's  devilish verses and his own;
  Prayers are too tedious, Lectures too abstruse,
  He flies from Tavell's frown to "Fordham's Mews;"
  (Unlucky Tavell!  doomed to daily cares 
  By pugilistic pupils, and by bears,)
  Fines, Tutors, tasks, Conventions threat in vain,
  Before hounds, hunters, and Newmarket Plain.
  Rough with his elders, with his equals rash,
  Civil to sharpers, prodigal of cash;
  Constant to nought--save hazard and a whore, 
  Yet cursing both--for both have made him sore:
  Unread (unless since books beguile disease,
  The P----x becomes his passage to Degrees);
  Fooled, pillaged, dunned, he wastes his terms away, 
  And unexpelled, perhaps, retires M.A.;
  Master of Arts! as hells and clubs  proclaim, 
  Where scarce a blackleg bears a brighter name!

    Launched into life, extinct his early fire,
  He apes the selfish prudence of his Sire;
  Marries for money, chooses friends for rank,
  Buys land, and shrewdly trusts not to the Bank;
  Sits in the Senate; gets a son and heir;
  Sends him to Harrow--for himself was there.
  Mute, though he votes, unless when called to cheer,
  His son's so sharp--he'll see the dog a Peer!

    Manhood declines--Age palsies every limb;
  He quits the scene--or else the scene quits him;
  Scrapes wealth, o'er each departing penny grieves, 
  And Avarice seizes all Ambition leaves;
  Counts cent per cent, and smiles, or vainly frets,
  O'er hoards diminished by young Hopeful's debts;
  Weighs well and wisely what to sell or buy,
  Complete in all life's lessons--but to die;
  Peevish and spiteful, doting, hard to please,
  Commending every time, save times like these;
  Crazed, querulous, forsaken, half forgot,
  Expires unwept--is buried--Let him rot!

    But from the Drama let me not digress,
  Nor spare my precepts, though they please you less. 
  Though Woman weep, and hardest hearts are stirred, 
  When what is done is rather seen than heard,
  Yet many deeds preserved in History's page
  Are better told than acted on the stage;
  The ear sustains what shocks the timid eye,
  And Horror thus subsides to Sympathy,
  True Briton all beside, I here am French--
  Bloodshed 'tis surely better to retrench:
  The gladiatorial gore we teach to flow
  In tragic scenes disgusts though but in show;
  We hate the carnage while we see the trick,
  And find small sympathy in being sick.
  Not on the stage the regicide Macbeth
  Appals an audience with a Monarch's death; 
  To gaze when sable Hubert threats to sear
  Young Arthur's eyes, can ours or Nature bear?
  A haltered heroine  Johnson sought to slay--
  We saved Irene, but half damned the play,
  And (Heaven be praised!) our tolerating times
  Stint Metamorphoses to Pantomimes;
  And Lewis'  self, with all his sprites, would quake
  To change Earl Osmond's negro to a snake!
  Because, in scenes exciting joy or grief,
  We loathe the action which exceeds belief:
  And yet, God knows! what may not authors do,
  Whose Postscripts prate of dyeing "heroines blue"?

    Above all things, Dan Poet, if you can,
  Eke out your acts, I pray, with mortal man,
  Nor call a ghost, unless some cursed scrape 
  Must open ten trap-doors for your escape.
  Of all the monstrous things I'd fain forbid,
  I loathe an Opera worse than Dennis did; 
  Where good and evil persons, right or wrong,
  Rage, love, and aught but moralise--in song.
  Hail, last memorial of our foreign friends, 
  Which Gaul allows, and still Hesperia lends!
  Napoleon's edicts no embargo lay
  On whores--spies--singers--wisely shipped away.
  Our giant Capital, whose squares are spread 
  Where rustics earned, and now may beg, their bread,
  In all iniquity is grown so nice,
  It scorns amusements which are not of price.
  Hence the pert shopkeeper, whose throbbing ear
  Aches with orchestras which he pays to hear, 
  Whom shame, not sympathy, forbids to snore,
  His anguish doubling by his own "encore;"
  Squeezed in "Fop's Alley,"  jostled by the beaux,
  Teased with his hat, and trembling for his toes;
  Scarce wrestles through the night, nor tastes of ease,
  Till the dropped curtain gives a glad release:
  Why this, and more, he suffers--can ye guess?--
  Because it costs him dear, and makes him dress! 

    So prosper eunuchs from Etruscan schools;
  Give us but fiddlers, and they're sure of fools!
  Ere scenes were played by many a reverend clerk,  
  (What harm, if David danced before the ark?)
  In Christmas revels, simple country folks
  Were pleased with morrice-mumm'ry and coarse jokes.
  Improving years, with things no longer known,
  Produced blithe Punch and merry Madame Joan,
  Who still frisk on with feats so lewdly low, 
  'Tis strange Benvolio  suffers such a show;
  Suppressing peer! to whom each vice gives place, 
  Oaths, boxing, begging--all, save rout and race.

    Farce followed Comedy, and reached her prime,
  In ever-laughing Foote's fantastic time:
  Mad wag! who pardoned none, nor spared the best,
  And turned some very serious things to jest.
  Nor Church nor State escaped his public sneers,
  Arms nor the Gown--Priests--Lawyers--Volunteers:
  "Alas, poor Yorick!" now for ever mute!
  Whoever loves a laugh must sigh for Foote.

    We smile, perforce, when histrionic scenes
  Ape the swoln dialogue of Kings and Queens,
  When "Crononhotonthologos must die," 
  And Arthur struts in mimic majesty.

    Moschus! with whom once more I hope to sit, 
  And smile at folly, if we can't at wit;
  Yes, Friend! for thee I'll quit my cynic cell,
  And bear Swift's motto, "Vive la bagatelle!"
  Which charmed our days in each Aegean clime,
  As oft at home, with revelry and rhyme.
  Then may Euphrosyne, who sped the past,
  Soothe thy Life's scenes, nor leave thee in the last;
  But find in thine--like pagan Plato's bed,  
  Some merry Manuscript of Mimes, when dead.

    Now to the Drama let us bend our eyes,
  Where fettered by whig Walpole low she lies; 
  Corruption foiled her, for she feared her glance;
  Decorum left her for an Opera dance!
  Yet Chesterfield,  whose polished pen inveighs
  'Gainst laughter, fought for freedom to our Plays;
  Unchecked by Megrims of patrician brains,
  And damning Dulness of Lord Chamberlains.
  Repeal that act! again let Humour roam
  Wild o'er the stage--we've time for tears at home;
  Let Archer  plant the horns on Sullen's brows,
  And Estifania gull her "Copper"  spouse;
  The moral's scant--but that may be excused,
  Men go not to be lectured, but amused.
  He whom our plays dispose to Good or Ill
  Must wear a head in want of Willis' skill; 
  Aye, but Macheath's example--psha!--no more!
  It formed no thieves--the thief was formed before; 
  And spite of puritans and Collier's curse, 
  Plays make mankind no better, and no worse.
  Then spare our stage, ye methodistic men!
  Nor burn damned Drury if it rise again. 
  But why to brain-scorched bigots thus appeal?
  Can heavenly Mercy dwell with earthly Zeal?
  For times of fire and faggot let them hope!
  Times dear alike to puritan or Pope.
  As pious Calvin saw Servetus blaze,
  So would new sects on newer victims gaze.
  E'en now the songs of Solyma begin;
  Faith cants, perplexed apologist of Sin!
  While the Lord's servant chastens whom he loves,
  And Simeon kicks,  where Baxter only "shoves."

    Whom Nature guides, so writes, that every dunce ,
  Enraptured, thinks to do the same at once;
  But after inky thumbs and bitten nails ,
  And twenty scattered quires, the coxcomb fails.

    Let Pastoral be dumb; for who can hope
  To match the youthful eclogues of our Pope?
  Yet his and Philips'  faults, of different kind,
  For Art too rude, for Nature too refined,
  Instruct how hard the medium 'tis to hit
  'Twixt too much polish and too coarse a wit.

    A vulgar scribbler, certes, stands disgraced
  In this nice age, when all aspire to taste;
  The dirty language, and the noisome jest,
  Which pleased in Swift of yore, we now detest;
  Proscribed not only in the world polite ,
  But even too nasty for a City Knight!

    Peace to Swift's faults! his wit hath made them pass,
  Unmatched by all, save matchless Hudibras!
  Whose author is perhaps the first we meet,
  Who from our couplet lopped two final feet;
  Nor less in merit than the longer line,
  This measure moves a favourite of the Nine.
  Though at first view eight feet may seem in vain
  Formed, save in Ode, to bear a serious strain ,
  Yet Scott has shown our wondering isle of late
  This measure shrinks not from a theme of weight,
  And, varied skilfully, surpasses far
  Heroic rhyme, but most in Love and War,
  Whose fluctuations, tender or sublime,
  Are curbed too much by long-recurring rhyme.

    But many a skilful judge abhors to see,
  What few admire--irregularity.
  This some vouchsafe to pardon; but 'tis hard
  When such a word contents a British Bard.

    And must the Bard his glowing thoughts confine, 
  Lest Censure hover o'er some faulty line?
  Remove whate'er a critic may suspect,
  To gain the paltry suffrage of "Correct"?
  Or prune the spirit of each daring phrase,
  To fly from Error, not to merit Praise?

    Ye, who seek finished models, never cease ,
  By day and night, to read the works of Greece.
  But our good Fathers never bent their brains
  To heathen Greek, content with native strains.
  The few who read a page, or used a pen,
  Were satisfied with Chaucer and old Ben;
  The jokes and numbers suited to their taste
  Were quaint and careless, anything but chaste;
  Yet, whether right or wrong the ancient rules,
  It will not do to call our Fathers fools!
  Though you and I, who eruditely know
  To separate the elegant and low,
  Can also, when a hobbling line appears,
  Detect with fingers--in default of ears.

    In sooth I do not know, or greatly care
  To learn, who our first English strollers were;
  Or if, till roofs received the vagrant art,
  Our Muse, like that of Thespis, kept a cart;
  But this is certain, since our Shakespeare's days,
  There's pomp enough--if little else--in plays;
  Nor will Melpomene ascend her Throne 
  Without high heels, white plume, and Bristol stone.

    Old Comedies still meet with much applause,
  Though too licentious for dramatic laws;
  At least, we moderns, wisely, 'tis confest,
  Curtail, or silence, the lascivious jest .

    Whate'er their follies, and their faults beside,
  Our enterprising Bards pass nought untried;
  Nor do they merit slight applause who choose
  An English subject for an English Muse,
  And leave to minds which never dare invent
  French flippancy and German sentiment.
  Where is that living language which could claim
  Poetic more, as philosophic, fame,
  If all our Bards, more patient of delay,
  Would stop, like Pope, to polish by the way? 

    Lords of the quill, whose critical assaults
  O'erthrow whole quartos with their quires of faults ,
  Who soon detect, and mark where'er we fail,
  And prove our marble with too nice a nail!
  Democritus himself was not so bad;
  He only 'thought'--but 'you' would make us--mad!

    But truth to say, most rhymers rarely guard
  Against that ridicule they deem so hard;
  In person negligent, they wear, from sloth,
  Beards of a week, and nails of annual growth;
  Reside in garrets, fly from those they meet,
  And walk in alleys rather than the street.

    With little rhyme, less reason, if you please,
  The name of Poet may be got with ease,
  So that not tuns of helleboric juice 
  Shall ever turn your head to any use;
  Write but like Wordsworth--live beside a lake,
  And keep your bushy locks a year from Blake; 
  Then print your book, once more return to town,
  And boys shall hunt your Bardship up and down. 
  Am I not wise, if such some poets' plight,
  To purge in spring--like Bayes --before I write?
  If this precaution softened not my bile,
  I know no scribbler with a madder style;
  But since (perhaps my feelings are too nice)
  I cannot purchase Fame at such a price,
  I'll labour gratis as a grinders' wheel, 
  And, blunt myself, give edge to other's steel,
  Nor write at all, unless to teach the art
  To those rehearsing for the Poet's part;
  From Horace show the pleasing paths of song, ,
  And from my own example--what is wrong.

    Though modern practice sometimes differs quite,
  'Tis just as well to think before you write;
  Let every book that suits your theme be read,
  So shall you trace it to the fountain-head.

    He who has learned the duty which he owes
  To friends and country, and to pardon foes;
  Who models his deportment as may best
  Accord with Brother, Sire, or Stranger-guest;
  Who takes our Laws and Worship as they are,
  Nor roars reform for Senate, Church, and Bar;
  In practice, rather than loud precept, wise,
  Bids not his tongue, but heart, philosophize:
  Such is the man the Poet should rehearse,
  As joint exemplar of his life and verse.

    Sometimes a sprightly wit, and tale well told,
  Without much grace, or weight, or art, will hold
  A longer empire o'er the public mind
  Than sounding trifles, empty, though refined.

    Unhappy Greece! thy sons of ancient days
  The Muse may celebrate with perfect praise,
  Whose generous children narrowed not their hearts
  With Commerce, given alone to Arms and Arts. 
  Our boys (save those whom public schools compel
  To "Long and Short" before they're taught to spell)
  From frugal fathers soon imbibe by rote,
  "A penny saved, my lad, 's a penny got."
  Babe of a city birth! from sixpence take 
  The third, how much will the remainder make?--
  "A groat."--"Ah, bravo! Dick hath done the sum! 
  He'll swell my fifty thousand to a Plum."

    They whose young souls receive this rust betimes,
  'Tis clear, are fit for anything but rhymes;
  And Locke will tell you, that the father's right
  Who hides all verses from his children's sight;
  For Poets (says this Sage , and many more,)
  Make sad mechanics with their lyric lore: 
  And Delphi now, however rich of old,
  Discovers little silver, and less gold,
  Because Parnassus, though a Mount divine,
  Is poor as Irus,  or an Irish mine.

    Two objects always should the Poet move,
  Or one or both,--to please or to improve.
  Whate'er you teach, be brief, if you design
  For our remembrance your didactic line;
  Redundance places Memory on the rack,
  For brains may be o'erloaded, like the back. 

    Fiction does best when taught to look like Truth,
  And fairy fables bubble none but youth:
  Expect no credit for too wondrous tales,
  Since Jonas only springs alive from Whales!

    Young men with aught but Elegance dispense;
  Maturer years require a little Sense.
  To end at once:--that Bard for all is fit 
  Who mingles well instruction with his wit;
  For him Reviews shall smile; for him o'erflow
  The patronage of Paternoster-row;
  His book, with Longman's liberal aid, shall pass
  (Who ne'er despises books that bring him brass);
  Through three long weeks the taste of London lead,
  And cross St. George's Channel and the Tweed.

  But every thing has faults, nor is't unknown
  That harps and fiddles often lose their tone,
  And wayward voices, at their owner's call,
  With all his best endeavours, only squall;
  Dogs blink their covey, flints withhold the spark,
  And double-barrels (damn them!) miss their mark.  

  Where frequent beauties strike the reader's view,
  We must not quarrel for a blot or two;
  But pardon equally to books or men,
  The slips of Human Nature, and the Pen.
  Yet if an author, spite of foe or friend,
  Despises all advice too much to mend,
  But ever twangs the same discordant string,
  Give him no quarter, howsoe'er he sing.
  Let Havard's  fate o'ertake him, who, for once,
  Produced a play too dashing for a dunce:
  At first none deemed it his; but when his name
  Announced the fact--what then?--it lost its fame.
  Though all deplore when Milton deigns to doze, 
  In a long work 'tis fair to steal repose.

  As Pictures, so shall Poems be; some stand
  The critic eye, and please when near at hand; 
  But others at a distance strike the sight;
  This seeks the shade, but that demands the light,
  Nor dreads the connoisseur's fastidious view,
  But, ten times scrutinised, is ten times new.

  Parnassian pilgrims! ye whom chance, or choice, 
  Hath led to listen to the Muse's voice,
  Receive this counsel, and be timely wise;
  Few reach the Summit which before you lies.
  Our Church and State, our Courts and Camps, concede
  Reward to very moderate heads indeed!
  In these plain common sense will travel far;
  All are not Erskines who mislead the Bar:  
  But Poesy between the best and worst
  No medium knows; you must be last or first;
  For middling Poets' miserable volumes
  Are damned alike by Gods, and Men, and Columns. 
  Again, my Jeffrey--as that sound inspires, 
  How wakes my bosom to its wonted fires!
  Fires, such as gentle Caledonians feel
  When Southrons writhe upon their critic wheel,
  Or mild Eclectics,  when some, worse than Turks,
  Would rob poor Faith to decorate "Good Works."
  Such are the genial feelings them canst claim--
  My Falcon flies not at ignoble game.
  Mightiest of all Dunedin's beasts of chase!
  For thee my Pegasus would mend his pace.
  Arise, my Jeffrey! or my inkless pen
  Shall never blunt its edge on meaner men;
  Till thee or thine mine evil eye discerns,
  "Alas! I cannot strike at wretched kernes." 
  Inhuman Saxon! wilt thou then resign
  A Muse and heart by choice so wholly thine?
  Dear d--d contemner of my schoolboy songs,
  Hast thou no vengeance for my Manhood's wrongs?
  If unprovoked thou once could bid me bleed,
  Hast thou no weapon for my daring deed?
  What! not a word!--and am I then so low?
  Wilt thou forbear, who never spared a foe?
  Hast thou no wrath, or wish to give it vent?
  No wit for Nobles, Dunces by descent?
  No jest on "minors," quibbles on a name, 
  Nor one facetious paragraph of blame?
  Is it for this on Ilion I have stood,
  And thought of Homer less than Holyrood?
  On shore of Euxine or Aegean sea,
  My hate, untravelled, fondly turned to thee.
  Ah! let me cease! in vain my bosom burns,
  From Corydon unkind Alexis turns:
  Thy rhymes are vain; thy Jeffrey then forego,
  Nor woo that anger which he will not show.
  What then?--Edina starves some lanker son,
  To write an article thou canst not shun;
  Some less fastidious Scotchman shall be found,
  As bold in Billingsgate, though less renowned.

    As if at table some discordant dish, 
  Should shock our optics, such as frogs for fish;
  As oil in lieu of butter men decry,
  And poppies please not in a modern pie;
  If all such mixtures then be half a crime,
  We must have Excellence to relish rhyme.
  Mere roast and boiled no Epicure invites;
  Thus Poetry disgusts, or else delights.

    Who shoot not flying rarely touch a gun:
  Will he who swims not to the river run?
  And men unpractised in exchanging knocks
  Must go to Jackson  ere they dare to box.
  Whate'er the weapon, cudgel, fist, or foil,
  None reach expertness without years of toil;
  But fifty dunces can, with perfect ease,
  Tag twenty thousand couplets, when they please.
  Why not?--shall I, thus qualified to sit
  For rotten boroughs, never show my wit?
  Shall I, whose fathers with the "Quorum" sate, 
  And lived in freedom on a fair estate;
  Who left me heir, with stables, kennels, packs, 
  To 'all' their income, and to--'twice' its tax;
  Whose form and pedigree have scarce a fault,
  Shall I, I say, suppress my Attic Salt?

    Thus think "the Mob of Gentlemen;" but you,
  Besides all this, must have some Genius too.
  Be this your sober judgment, and a rule,
  And print not piping hot from Southey's school,
  Who (ere another Thalaba appears),
  I trust, will spare us for at least nine years.
  And hark'ye, Southey!  pray--but don't be vexed--
  Burn all your last three works--and half the next.
  But why this vain advice? once published, books
  Can never be recalled--from pastry-cooks!
  Though "Madoc," with "Pucelle,"  instead of Punk,
  May travel back to Quito--on a trunk! 

    Orpheus, we learn from Ovid and Lempriere,
  Led all wild beasts but Women by the ear;
  And had he fiddled at the present hour,
  We'd seen the Lions waltzing in the Tower; 
  And old Amphion, such were minstrels then,
  Had built St. Paul's without the aid of Wren.
  Verse too was Justice, and the Bards of Greece
  Did more than constables to keep the peace;
  Abolished cuckoldom with much applause,
  Called county meetings, and enforced the laws,
  Cut down crown influence with reforming scythes,
  And served the Church--without demanding tithes;
  And hence, throughout all Hellas and the East,
  Each Poet was a Prophet and a Priest,
  Whose old-established Board of Joint Controls 
  Included kingdoms in the cure of souls.

    Next rose the martial Homer, Epic's prince,
  And Fighting's been in fashion ever since;
  And old Tyrtaeus, when the Spartans warred,
  (A limping leader, but a lofty bard) 
  Though walled Ithome had resisted long,
  Reduced the fortress by the force of song.

    When Oracles prevailed, in times of old,
  In song alone Apollo's will was told. 
  Then if your verse is what all verse should be,
  And Gods were not ashamed on't, why should we?

    The Muse, like mortal females, may be wooed; 
  In turns she'll seem a Paphian, or a prude;
  Fierce as a bride when first she feels affright,
  Mild as the same upon the second night;
  Wild as the wife of Alderman or Peer,
  Now for His Grace, and now a grenadier!
  Her eyes beseem, her heart belies, her zone--
  Ice in a crowd--and Lava when alone.

    If Verse be studied with some show of Art.
  Kind Nature always will perform her part;
  Though without Genius, and a native vein
  Of wit, we loathe an artificial strain,
  Yet Art and Nature joined will win the prize,
  Unless they act like us and our allies.

    The youth who trains to ride, or run a race,
  Must bear privations with unruffled face,
  Be called to labour when he thinks to dine,
  And, harder still, leave wenching and his wine.
  Ladies who sing, at least who sing at sight,
  Have followed Music through her farthest flight; 
  But rhymers tell you neither more nor less,
  "I've got a pretty poem for the Press;"
  And that's enough; then write and print so fast;--
  If Satan take the hindmost, who'd be last?
  They storm the Types, they publish, one and all,  
  They leap the counter, and they leave the stall.
  Provincial Maidens, men of high command,
  Yea! Baronets have inked the bloody hand!
  Cash cannot quell them; Pollio played this prank, 
  (Then Phoebus first found credit in a Bank!)
  Not all the living only, but the dead,
  Fool on, as fluent as an Orpheus' Head;
  Damned all their days, they posthumously thrive,
  Dug up from dust, though buried when alive!
  Reviews record this epidemic crime,
  Those Books of Martyrs to the rage for rhyme.
  Alas! woe worth the scribbler! often seen
  In Morning Post, or Monthly Magazine.
  There lurk his earlier lays; but soon, hot pressed, 
  Behold a Quarto!--Tarts must tell the rest.
  Then leave, ye wise, the Lyre's precarious chords
  To muse-mad baronets, or madder lords,
  Or country Crispins, now grown somewhat stale,
  Twin Doric minstrels, drunk with Doric ale!
  Hark to those notes, narcotically soft!
  The Cobbler-Laureats  sing to Capel Lofft! 
  Till, lo! that modern Midas, as he hears, 
  Adds an ell growth to his egregious ears! 
  There lives one Druid, who prepares in time 
  'Gainst future feuds his poor revenge of rhyme;
  Racks his dull Memory, and his duller Muse,
  To publish faults which Friendship should excuse.
  If Friendship's nothing, Self-regard might teach
  More polished usage of his parts of speech.
  But what is shame, or what is aught to him? 
  He vents his spleen, or gratifies his whim.
  Some fancied slight has roused his lurking hate,
  Some folly crossed, some jest, or some debate;
  Up to his den Sir Scribbler hies, and soon
  The gathered gall is voided in Lampoon.
  Perhaps at some pert speech you've dared to frown,
  Perhaps your Poem may have pleased the Town:
  If so, alas! 'tis nature in the man--
  May Heaven forgive you, for he never can!
  Then be it so; and may his withering Bays
  Bloom fresh in satire, though they fade in praise
  While his lost songs no more shall steep and stink
  The dullest, fattest weeds on Lethe's brink,
  But springing upwards from the sluggish mould,
  Be (what they never were before) be--sold!
  Should some rich Bard (but such a monster now, 
  In modern Physics, we can scarce allow),
  Should some pretending scribbler of the Court,
  Some rhyming Peer--there's plenty of the sort-- 
  All but one poor dependent priest withdrawn,
  (Ah! too regardless of his Chaplain's yawn!)
  Condemn the unlucky Curate to recite
  Their last dramatic work by candle-light,
  How would the preacher turn each rueful leaf,
  Dull as his sermons, but not half so brief!
  Yet, since 'tis promised at the Rector's death,
  He'll risk no living for a little breath.
  Then spouts and foams, and cries at every line,
  (The Lord forgive him!) "Bravo! Grand! Divine!"
  Hoarse with those praises (which, by Flatt'ry fed, 
  Dependence barters for her bitter bread),
  He strides and stamps along with creaking boot;
  Till the floor echoes his emphatic foot,
  Then sits again, then rolls his pious eye, 
  As when the dying vicar will not die!
  Nor feels, forsooth, emotion at his heart;--
  But all Dissemblers overact their part.

    Ye, who aspire to "build the lofty rhyme," 
  Believe not all who laud your false "sublime;"
  But if some friend shall hear your work, and say,
  "Expunge that stanza, lop that line away,"
  And, after fruitless efforts, you return
  Without amendment, and he answers, "Burn!"
  That instant throw your paper in the fire,
  Ask not his thoughts, or follow his desire;
  But (if true Bard!) you scorn to condescend, 
  And will not alter what you can't defend,
  If you will breed this Bastard of your Brains, 
  We'll have no words--I've only lost my pains.

    Yet, if you only prize your favourite thought,
  As critics kindly do, and authors ought;
  If your cool friend annoy you now and then,
  And cross whole pages with his plaguy pen;
  No matter, throw your ornaments aside,--
  Better let him than all the world deride.
  Give light to passages too much in shade,
  Nor let a doubt obscure one verse you've made;
  Your friend's a "Johnson," not to leave one word,
  However trifling, which may seem absurd;
  Such erring trifles lead to serious ills,
  And furnish food for critics, or their quills. 

    As the Scotch fiddle, with its touching tune,
  Or the sad influence of the angry Moon,
  All men avoid bad writers' ready tongues,
  As yawning waiters fly  Fitzscribble's lungs; 
  Yet on he mouths--ten minutes--tedious each  
  As Prelate's homily, or placeman's speech;
  Long as the last years of a lingering lease,
  When Riot pauses until Rents increase.
  While such a minstrel, muttering fustian, strays
  O'er hedge and ditch, through unfrequented ways,
  If by some chance he walks into a well,
  And shouts for succour with stentorian yell,
  "A rope! help, Christians, as ye hope for grace!"
  Nor woman, man, nor child will stir a pace;
  For there his carcass he might freely fling, 
  From frenzy, or the humour of the thing.
  Though this has happened to more Bards than one;
  I'll tell you Budgell's story,--and have done.

  Budgell, a rogue and rhymester, for no good,
  (Unless his case be much misunderstood)
  When teased with creditors' continual claims,
  "To die like Cato,"  leapt into the Thames!
  And therefore be it lawful through the town
  For any Bard to poison, hang, or drown.
  Who saves the intended Suicide receives
  Small thanks from him who loathes the life he leaves;
  And, sooth to say, mad poets must not lose
  The Glory of that death they freely choose.

  Nor is it certain that some sorts of verse 
  Prick not the Poet's conscience as a curse;
  Dosed  with vile drams on Sunday he was found,
  Or got a child on consecrated ground!
  And hence is haunted with a rhyming rage--
  Feared like a bear just bursting from his cage.
  If free, all fly his versifying fit,
  Fatal at once to Simpleton or Wit:
  But 'him', unhappy! whom he seizes,--'him'
  He flays with Recitation limb by limb;
  Probes to the quick where'er he makes his breach,
  And gorges like a Lawyer--or a Leech.

THE CURSE OF MINERVA.

                     Pallas te hoc Vulnere Pallas
    Immolat et poenam scelerato ex Sanguine Sumit.

  Slow sinks, more lovely ere his race be run, 
  Along Morea's hills the setting Sun;
  Not, as in northern climes, obscurely bright,
  But one unclouded blaze of living light;
  O'er the hushed deep the yellow beam he throws, 
  Gilds the green wave that trembles as it glows;
  On old Aegina's rock and Hydra's isle 
  The God of gladness sheds his parting smile;
  O'er his own regions lingering loves to shine,
  Though there his altars are no more divine.
  Descending fast, the mountain-shadows kiss
  Thy glorious Gulf, unconquered Salamis!
  Their azure arches through the long expanse, 
  More deeply purpled, meet his mellowing glance,
  And tenderest tints, along their summits driven,
  Mark his gay course, and own the hues of Heaven;
  Till, darkly shaded from the land and deep,
  Behind his Delphian rock he sinks to sleep. 

    On such an eve his palest beam he cast
  When, Athens! here thy Wisest looked his last.
  How watched thy better sons his farewell ray,
  That closed their murdered Sage's  latest day!
  Not yet--not yet--Sol pauses on the hill,
  The precious hour of parting lingers still;
  But sad his light to agonizing eyes,
  And dark the mountain's once delightful dyes;
  Gloom o'er the lovely land he seemed to pour,
  The land where Phoebus never frowned before;
  But ere he sunk below Cithaeron's head,
  The cup of Woe was quaffed--the Spirit fled;
  The soul of Him that scorned to fear or fly, 
  Who lived and died as none can live or die.

    But lo! from high Hymettus to the plain
  The Queen of Night asserts her silent reign;  
  No murky vapour, herald of the storm, 
  Hides her fair face, or girds her glowing form;
  With cornice glimmering as the moonbeams play,
  There the white column greets her grateful ray,
  And bright around, with quivering beams beset,
  Her emblem sparkles o'er the Minaret;
  The groves of olive scattered dark and wide,
  Where meek Cephisus sheds his scanty tide,
  The cypress saddening by the sacred mosque,
  The gleaming turret of the gay kiosk, 
  And sad and sombre 'mid the holy calm,
  Near Theseus' fane, yon solitary palm;
  All, tinged with varied hues, arrest the eye;
  And dull were his that passed them heedless by. 
  Again the Aegean, heard no more afar,
  Lulls his chafed breast from elemental war:
  Again his waves in milder tints unfold
  Their long expanse of sapphire and of gold,
  Mixed with the shades of many a distant isle
  That frown, where gentler Ocean deigns to smile. 

    As thus, within the walls of Pallas' fane,
  I marked the beauties of the land and main,
  Alone, and friendless, on the magic shore,
  Whose arts and arms but live in poets' lore;
  Oft as the matchless dome I turned to scan,
  Sacred to Gods, but not secure from Man,
  The Past returned, the Present seemed to cease,
  And Glory knew no clime beyond her Greece!

    Hour rolled along, and Dian's orb on high
  Had gained the centre of her softest sky;
  And yet unwearied still my footsteps trod
  O'er the vain shrine of many a vanished God: 
  But chiefly, Pallas! thine, when Hecate's glare
  Checked by thy columns, fell more sadly fair
  O'er the chill marble, where the startling tread
  Thrills the lone heart like echoes from the dead.
  Long had I mused, and treasured every trace
  The wreck of Greece recorded of her race,
  When, lo! a giant-form before me strode,
  And Pallas hailed me in her own Abode!

    Yes,'twas Minerva's self; but, ah! how changed,
  Since o'er the Dardan field in arms she ranged!
  Not such as erst, by her divine command,
  Her form appeared from Phidias' plastic hand:
  Gone were the terrors of her awful brow,
  Her idle Aegis bore no Gorgon now;
  Her helm was dinted, and the broken lance
  Seemed weak and shaftless e'en to mortal glance;
  The Olive Branch, which still she deigned to clasp,
  Shrunk from her touch, and withered in her grasp;
  And, ah! though still the brightest of the sky,
  Celestial tears bedimmed her large blue eye;
  Round the rent casque her owlet circled slow,
  And mourned his mistress with a shriek of woe!

    "Mortal!"--'twas thus she spake--"that blush of shame
  Proclaims thee Briton, once a noble name;
  First of the mighty, foremost of the free, 
  Now honoured 'less' by all, and 'least' by me:
  Chief of thy foes shall Pallas still be found.
  Seek'st thou the cause of loathing!--look around.
  Lo! here, despite of war and wasting fire,
  I saw successive Tyrannies expire;
  'Scaped from the ravage of the Turk and Goth, 
  Thy country sends a spoiler worse than both.
  Survey this vacant, violated fane;
  Recount the relics torn that yet remain:
  'These' Cecrops placed, 'this' Pericles adorned, 
  'That' Adrian reared when drooping Science mourned.
  What more I owe let Gratitude attest--
  Know, Alaric and Elgin did the rest.
  That all may learn from whence the plunderer came,
  The insulted wall sustains his hated name: 
  For Elgin's fame thus grateful Pallas pleads,
  Below, his name--above, behold his deeds!
  Be ever hailed with equal honour here
  The Gothic monarch and the Pictish peer:
  Arms gave the first his right, the last had none,
  But basely stole what less barbarians won.
  So when the Lion quits his fell repast,
  Next prowls the Wolf, the filthy Jackal last: 
  Flesh, limbs, and blood the former make their own,
  The last poor brute securely gnaws the bone.
  Yet still the Gods are just, and crimes are crossed:
  See here what Elgin won, and what he lost!
  Another name with his pollutes my shrine:
  Behold where Dian's beams disdain to shine!
  Some retribution still might Pallas claim,
  When Venus half avenged Minerva's shame." 

    She ceased awhile, and thus I dared reply,
  To soothe the vengeance kindling in her eye:
  "Daughter of Jove! in Britain's injured name, 
  A true-born Briton may the deed disclaim.
  Frown not on England; England owns him not:
  Athena, no! thy plunderer was a Scot.
  Ask'st thou the difference? From fair Phyles' towers
  Survey Boeotia;--Caledonia's ours.
  And well I know within that bastard land 
  Hath Wisdom's goddess never held command;
  A barren soil, where Nature's germs, confined
  To stern sterility, can stint the mind;
  Whose thistle well betrays the niggard earth,
  Emblem of all to whom the Land gives birth;
  Each genial influence nurtured to resist;
  A land of meanness, sophistry, and mist. 
  Each breeze from foggy mount and marshy plain
  Dilutes with drivel every drizzly brain,
  Till, burst at length, each wat'ry head o'erflows,
  Foul as their soil, and frigid as their snows:
  Then thousand schemes of petulance and pride
  Despatch her scheming children far and wide;
  Some East, some West, some--everywhere but North!
  In quest of lawless gain, they issue forth.
  And thus--accursed be the day and year!
  She sent a Pict to play the felon here.
  Yet Caledonia claims some native worth, 
  As dull Boeotia gave a Pindar birth;
  So may her few, the lettered and the brave,
  Bound to no clime, and victors of the grave,
  Shake off the sordid dust of such a land,
  And shine like children of a happier strand;
  As once, of yore, in some obnoxious place,
  Ten names (if found) had saved a wretched race."

    "Mortal!" the blue-eyed maid resumed, "once more
  Bear back my mandate to thy native shore. 
  Though fallen, alas! this vengeance yet is mine,
  To turn my counsels far from lands like thine.
  Hear then in silence Pallas' stern behest;
  Hear and believe, for Time will tell the rest.

    "First on the head of him who did this deed
  My curse shall light,--on him and all his seed:
  Without one spark of intellectual fire,
  Be all the sons as senseless as the sire:
  If one with wit the parent brood disgrace,
  Believe him bastard of a brighter race:
  Still with his hireling artists let him prate,
  And Folly's praise repay for Wisdom's hate;
  Long of their Patron's gusto let them tell,
  Whose noblest, native gusto is--to sell:
  To sell, and make--may shame record the day!--
  The State--Receiver of his pilfered prey.
  Meantime, the flattering, feeble dotard, West,
  Europe's worst dauber, and poor Britain's best,
  With palsied hand shall turn each model o'er,
  And own himself an infant of fourscore. 
  Be all the Bruisers culled from all St. Giles',
  That Art and Nature may compare their styles;
  While brawny brutes in stupid wonder stare,
  And marvel at his Lordship's 'stone shop' there. 
  Round the thronged gate shall sauntering coxcombs creep
  To lounge and lucubrate, to prate and peep;
  While many a languid maid, with longing sigh,
  On giant statues casts the curious eye;
  The room with transient glance appears to skim,
  Yet marks the mighty back and length of limb;
  Mourns o'er the difference of now and then;
  Exclaims, 'These Greeks indeed were proper men!'
  Draws slight comparisons of 'these' with 'those', 
  And envies Lais all her Attic beaux.
  When shall a modern maid have swains like these? 
  Alas! Sir Harry is no Hercules!
  And last of all, amidst the gaping crew,
  Some calm spectator, as he takes his view,
  In silent indignation mixed with grief,
  Admires the plunder, but abhors the thief.
  Oh, loathed in life, nor pardoned in the dust,
  May Hate pursue his sacrilegious lust!
  Linked with the fool that fired the Ephesian dome,
  Shall vengeance follow far beyond the tomb, 
  And Eratostratus  and Elgin shine
  In many a branding page and burning line;
  Alike reserved for aye to stand accursed,
  Perchance the second blacker than the first.

    "So let him stand, through ages yet unborn,
  Fixed statue on the pedestal of Scorn;
  Though not for him alone revenge shall wait,
  But fits thy country for her coming fate:
  Hers were the deeds that taught her lawless son
  To do what oft Britannia's self had done.
  Look to the Baltic--blazing from afar,
  Your old Ally yet mourns perfidious war. 
  Not to such deeds did Pallas lend her aid,
  Or break the compact which herself had made;
  Far from such counsels, from the faithless field
  She fled--but left behind her Gorgon shield;
  A fatal gift that turned your friends to stone,
  And left lost Albion hated and alone.

  "Look to the East,  where Ganges' swarthy race
  Shall shake your tyrant empire to its base;
  Lo! there Rebellion rears her ghastly head,
  And glares the Nemesis of native dead;
  Till Indus rolls a deep purpureal flood,
  And claims his long arrear of northern blood.
  So may ye perish!--Pallas, when she gave
  Your free-born rights, forbade ye to enslave.

    "Look on your Spain!--she clasps the hand she hates,
  But boldly clasps, and thrusts you from her gates.
  Bear witness, bright Barossa!  thou canst tell
  Whose were the sons that bravely fought and fell.
  But Lusitania, kind and dear ally,
  Can spare a few to fight, and sometimes fly.
  Oh glorious field! by Famine fiercely won,
  The Gaul retires for once, and all is done!
  But when did Pallas teach, that one retreat
  Retrieved three long Olympiads of defeat?

    "Look last at home--ye love not to look there
  On the grim smile of comfortless despair:
  Your city saddens: loud though Revel howls,
  Here Famine faints, and yonder Rapine prowls.
  See all alike of more or less bereft;
  No misers tremble when there's nothing left.
  'Blest paper credit;'  who shall dare to sing?
  It clogs like lead Corruption's weary wing.
  Yet Pallas pluck'd each Premier by the ear,
  Who Gods and men alike disdained to hear;
  But one, repentant o'er a bankrupt state,
  On Pallas calls,--but calls, alas! too late:
  Then raves for'----'; to that Mentor bends,
  Though he and Pallas never yet were friends.
  Him senates hear, whom never yet they heard,
  Contemptuous once, and now no less absurd.
  So, once of yore, each reasonable frog,
  Swore faith and fealty to his sovereign 'log.'
  Thus hailed your rulers their patrician clod,
  As Egypt chose an onion  for a God.

    "Now fare ye well! enjoy your little hour;
  Go, grasp the shadow of your vanished power;
  Gloss o'er the failure of each fondest scheme;
  Your strength a name, your bloated wealth a dream.
  Gone is that Gold, the marvel of mankind.
  And Pirates barter all that's left behind. 
  No more the hirelings, purchased near and far,
  Crowd to the ranks of mercenary war.
  The idle merchant on the useless quay
  Droops o'er the bales no bark may bear away;
  Or, back returning, sees rejected stores
  Rot piecemeal on his own encumbered shores:
  The starved mechanic breaks his rusting loom,
  And desperate mans him 'gainst the coming doom.
  Then in the Senates of your sinking state
  Show me the man whose counsels may have weight.
  Vain is each voice where tones could once command;
  E'en factions cease to charm a factious land:
  Yet jarring sects convulse a sister Isle,
  And light with maddening hands the mutual pile.

    "'Tis done, 'tis past--since Pallas warns in vain;
  The Furies seize her abdicated reign:
  Wide o'er the realm they wave their kindling brands,
  And wring her vitals with their fiery hands.
  But one convulsive struggle still remains, 
  And Gaul shall weep ere Albion wear her chains,
  The bannered pomp of war, the glittering files, 
  O'er whose gay trappings stern Bellona smiles;
  The brazen trump, the spirit-stirring drum,
  That bid the foe defiance ere they come;
  The hero bounding at his country's call,
  The glorious death that consecrates his fall,
  Swell the young heart with visionary charms.
  And bid it antedate the joys of arms.
  But know, a lesson you may yet be taught,
  With death alone are laurels cheaply bought;
  Not in the conflict Havoc seeks delight,
  His day of mercy is the day of fight.
  But when the field is fought, the battle won,
  Though drenched with gore, his woes are but begun:
  His deeper deeds as yet ye know by name;
  The slaughtered peasant and the ravished dame,
  The rifled mansion and the foe-reaped field,
  Ill suit with souls at home, untaught to yield.
  Say with what eye along the distant down
  Would flying burghers mark the blazing town?
  How view the column of ascending flames
  Shake his red shadow o'er the startled Thames?
  Nay, frown not, Albion! for the torch was thine
  That lit such pyres from Tagus to the Rhine:
  Now should they burst on thy devoted coast,
  Go, ask thy bosom who deserves them most?
  The law of Heaven and Earth is life for life,
  And she who raised, in vain regrets, the strife."

THE WALTZ:

AN APOSTROPHIC HYMN.

BY HORACE HORNEM, ESQ.

    "Qualis in Eurotae ripis, aut per juga Cynthi,
    Exercet DIANA choros."

    VIRGIL, 'Aen'. i. 502.

    "Such on Eurotas's banks, or Cynthus's height,
    Diana seems: and so she charms the sight,
    When in the dance the graceful goddess leads
    The quire of nymphs, and overtops their heads."

    DRYDEN'S Virgil.

  Muse of the many-twinkling feet!  whose charms
  Are now extended up from legs to arms;
  Terpsichore!--too long misdeemed a maid--
  Reproachful term--bestowed but to upbraid--
  Henceforth in all the bronze of brightness shine, 
  The least a Vestal of the Virgin Nine.
  Far be from thee and thine the name of Prude:
  Mocked yet triumphant; sneered at, unsubdued;
  Thy legs must move to conquer as they fly,
  If but thy coats are reasonably high!
  Thy breast--if bare enough--requires no shield;
  Dance forth--sans armour thou shalt take the field
  And own--impregnable to most assaults,
  Thy not too lawfully begotten "Waltz."

    Hail, nimble Nymph! to whom the young hussar, 
  The whiskered votary of Waltz and War,
  His night devotes, despite of spur and boots;
  A sight unmatched since Orpheus and his brutes:
  Hail, spirit-stirring Waltz!--beneath whose banners
  A modern hero fought for modish manners;
  On Hounslow's heath to rival Wellesley's  fame,
  Cocked, fired, and missed his man--but gained his aim;
  Hail, moving muse! to whom the fair one's breast
  Gives all it can, and bids us take the rest.
  Oh! for the flow of Busby,  or of Fitz,
  The latter's loyalty, the former's wits,
  To "energise the object I pursue,"
  And give both Belial and his Dance their due! 

    Imperial Waltz! imported from the Rhine
  (Famed for the growth of pedigrees and wine),
  Long be thine import from all duty free,
  And Hock itself be less esteemed than thee;
  In some few qualities alike--for Hock
  Improves our cellar--thou our living stock.
  The head to Hock belongs--thy subtler art
  Intoxicates alone the heedless heart:
  Through the full veins thy gentler poison swims,
  And wakes to Wantonness the willing limbs.

    Oh, Germany! how much to thee we owe,
  As heaven-born Pitt can testify below,
  Ere cursed Confederation made thee France's,
  And only left us thy d--d debts and dances! 
  Of subsidies and Hanover bereft,
  We bless thee still--George the Third is left!
  Of kings the best--and last, not least in worth,
  For graciously begetting George the Fourth.
  To Germany, and Highnesses serene,
  Who owe us millions--don't we owe the Queen?
  To Germany, what owe we not besides?
  So oft bestowing Brunswickers and brides;
  Who paid for vulgar, with her royal blood,
  Drawn from the stem of each Teutonic stud:
  Who sent us--so be pardoned all her faults--
  A dozen dukes, some kings, a Queen--and Waltz.

    But peace to her--her Emperor and Diet,
  Though now transferred to Buonaparte's "fiat!"
  Back to my theme--O muse of Motion! say,
  How first to Albion found thy Waltz her way?

    Borne on the breath of Hyperborean gales,
  From Hamburg's port (while Hamburg yet had mails),
  Ere yet unlucky Fame--compelled to creep
  To snowy Gottenburg-was chilled to sleep;
  Or, starting from her slumbers, deigned arise,
  Heligoland! to stock thy mart with lies; 
  While unburnt Moscow  yet had news to send,
  Nor owed her fiery Exit to a friend,
  She came--Waltz came--and with her certain sets
  Of true despatches, and as true Gazettes;
  Then flamed of Austerlitz the blest despatch, 
  Which Moniteur nor Morning Post can match
  And--almost crushed beneath the glorious news--
  Ten plays, and forty tales of Kotzebue's; 
  One envoy's letters, six composer's airs,
  And loads from Frankfort and from Leipsic fairs:
  Meiners' four volumes upon Womankind, 
  Like Lapland witches to ensure a wind;
  Brunck's heaviest tome for ballast,  and, to back it,
  Of Heyne,  such as should not sink the packet. 

    Fraught with this cargo--and her fairest freight,
  Delightful Waltz, on tiptoe for a Mate,
  The welcome vessel reached the genial strand,
  And round her flocked the daughters of the land.
  Not decent David, when, before the ark,
  His grand Pas-seul excited some remark;
  Not love-lorn Quixote, when his Sancho thought
  The knight's Fandango friskier than it ought;
  Not soft Herodias, when, with winning tread,
  Her nimble feet danced off another's head;
  Not Cleopatra on her Galley's Deck,
  Displayed so much of leg or more of neck,
  Than Thou, ambrosial Waltz, when first the Moon
  Beheld thee twirling to a Saxon tune!

    To You, ye husbands of ten years! whose brows
  Ache with the annual tributes of a spouse;
  To you of nine years less, who only bear
  The budding sprouts of those that you shall wear,
  With added ornaments around them rolled
  Of native brass, or law-awarded gold;
  To You, ye Matrons, ever on the watch
  To mar a son's, or make a daughter's match;
  To You, ye children of--whom chance accords--
  Always the Ladies, and sometimes their Lords;
  To You, ye single gentlemen, who seek
  Torments for life, or pleasures for a week;
  As Love or Hymen your endeavours guide,
  To gain your own, or snatch another's bride;--
  To one and all the lovely Stranger came,
  And every Ball-room echoes with her name.

    Endearing Waltz!--to thy more melting tune
  Bow Irish Jig, and ancient Rigadoon.
  Scotch reels, avaunt! and Country-dance forego
  Your future claims to each fantastic toe!
  Waltz--Waltz alone--both legs and arms demands,
  Liberal of feet, and lavish of her hands;
  Hands which may freely range in public sight
  Where ne'er before--but--pray "put out the light."
  Methinks the glare of yonder chandelier
  Shines much too far--or I am much too near;
  And true, though strange--Waltz whispers this remark,
  "My slippery steps are safest in the dark!"
  But here the Muse with due decorum halts,
  And lends her longest petticoat to "Waltz."

    Observant Travellers of every time!
  Ye Quartos published upon every clime!
  0 say, shall dull Romaika's heavy round,
  Fandango's wriggle, or Bolero's bound;
  Can Egypt's Almas --tantalising group--
  Columbia's caperers to the warlike Whoop--
  Can aught from cold Kamschatka to Cape Horn
  With Waltz compare, or after Waltz be born?
  Ah, no! from Morier's pages down to Galt's, 
  Each tourist pens a paragraph for "Waltz."

    Shades of those Belles whose reign began of yore,
  With George the Third's--and ended long before!--
  Though in your daughters' daughters yet you thrive, 
  Burst from your lead, and be yourselves alive!
  Back to the Ball-room speed your spectred host,
  Fool's Paradise is dull to that you lost. 
  No treacherous powder bids Conjecture quake;
  No stiff-starched stays make meddling fingers ache;
  (Transferred to those ambiguous things that ape
  Goats in their visage,  women in their shape;)
  No damsel faints when rather closely pressed,
  But more caressing seems when most caressed;
  Superfluous Hartshorn, and reviving Salts,
  Both banished by the sovereign cordial "Waltz."

    Seductive Waltz!--though on thy native shore
  Even Werter's self proclaimed thee half a whore;
  Werter--to decent vice though much inclined,
  Yet warm, not wanton; dazzled, but not blind--
  Though gentle Genlis,  in her strife with Stael,
  Would even proscribe thee from a Paris ball;
  The fashion hails--from Countesses to Queens,
  And maids and valets waltz behind the scenes;
  Wide and more wide thy witching circle spreads,
  And turns--if nothing else--at least our heads;
  With thee even clumsy cits attempt to bounce,
  And cockney's practise what they can't pronounce.
  Gods! how the glorious theme my strain exalts,
  And Rhyme finds partner Rhyme in praise of "Waltz!"
  Blest was the time Waltz chose for her debut!
  The Court, the Regent, like herself were new; 
  New face for friends, for foes some new rewards;
  New ornaments for black-and royal Guards; 
  New laws to hang the rogues that roared for bread;
  New coins (most new)  to follow those that fled;
  New victories--nor can we prize them less,
  Though Jenky  wonders at his own success;
  New wars, because the old succeed so well,
  That most survivors envy those who fell;
  New mistresses--no, old--and yet 'tis true,
  Though they be old, the thing is something new;
  Each new, quite new--(except some ancient tricks), 
  New white-sticks--gold-sticks--broom-sticks--all new sticks!
  With vests or ribands--decked alike in hue,
  New troopers strut, new turncoats blush in blue:
  So saith the Muse: my----,  what say you?
  Such was the time when Waltz might best maintain
  Her new preferments in this novel reign;
  Such was the time, nor ever yet was such;
  Hoops are  more, and petticoats not much;
  Morals and Minuets, Virtue and her stays,
  And tell-tale powder--all have had their days.
  The Ball begins--the honours of the house
  First duly done by daughter or by spouse,
  Some Potentate--or royal or serene--
  With Kent's gay grace, or sapient Gloster's mien, 
  Leads forth the ready dame, whose rising flush
  Might once have been mistaken for a blush.
  From where the garb just leaves the bosom free,
  That spot where hearts  were once supposed to be;
  Round all the confines of the yielded waist,
  The strangest hand may wander undisplaced:
  The lady's in return may grasp as much
  As princely paunches offer to her touch.
  Pleased round the chalky floor how well they trip
  One hand reposing on the royal hip! 
  The other to the shoulder no less royal
  Ascending with affection truly loyal!
  Thus front to front the partners move or stand,
  The foot may rest, but none withdraw the hand;
  And all in turn may follow in their rank,
  The Earl of--Asterisk--and Lady--Blank;
  Sir--Such-a-one--with those of fashion's host,  
  For whose blest surnames--vide "Morning Post."
  (Or if for that impartial print too late,
  Search Doctors' Commons six months from my date)--
  Thus all and each, in movement swift or slow,
  The genial contact gently undergo;
  Till some might marvel, with the modest Turk,
  If "nothing follows all this palming work?" 
  True, honest Mirza!--you may trust my rhyme--
  Something does follow at a fitter time;
  The breast thus publicly resigned to man,
  In private may resist him--if it can.

    O ye who loved our Grandmothers of yore,
  Fitzpatrick,  Sheridan, and many more!
  And thou, my Prince! whose sovereign taste and will 
  It is to love the lovely beldames still!
  Thou Ghost of Queensberry!  whose judging Sprite
  Satan may spare to peep a single night,
  Pronounce--if ever in your days of bliss
  Asmodeus struck so bright a stroke as this;
  To teach the young ideas how to rise,
  Flush in the cheek, and languish in the eyes;
  Rush to the heart, and lighten through the frame,
  With half-told wish, and ill-dissembled flame,
  For prurient Nature still will storm the breast--
  Who, tempted thus, can answer for the rest?

    But ye--who never felt a single thought
  For what our Morals are to be, or ought;
  Who wisely wish the charms you view to reap,
  Say--would you make those beauties quite so cheap?
  Hot from the hands promiscuously applied,
  Round the slight waist, or down the glowing side,
  Where were the rapture then to clasp the form
  From this lewd grasp and lawless contact warm? 
  At once Love's most endearing thought resign,
  To press the hand so pressed by none but thine;
  To gaze upon that eye which never met
  Another's ardent look without regret;
  Approach the lip which all, without restraint,
  Come near enough--if not to touch--to taint;
  If such thou lovest--love her then no more,
  Or give--like her--caresses to a score;
  Her Mind with these is gone, and with it go
  The little left behind it to bestow.

    Voluptuous Waltz! and dare I thus blaspheme?
  Thy bard forgot thy praises were his theme.
  Terpsichore forgive!--at every Ball
  My wife now waltzes--and my daughters shall;
  My son--(or stop--'tis needless to inquire--
  These little accidents should ne'er transpire;
  Some ages hence our genealogic tree 
  Will wear as green a bough for him as me)--
  Waltzing shall rear, to make our name amends
  Grandsons for me--in heirs to all his friends.

                        CHILDE HAROLD'S PILGRIMAGE

                             CANTO THE FIRST.

                            TO IANTHE.

    Not in those climes where I have late been straying,
      Though Beauty long hath there been matchless deemed,
      Not in those visions to the heart displaying
      Forms which it sighs but to have only dreamed,
      Hath aught like thee in Truth or Fancy seemed:
      Nor, having seen thee, shall I vainly seek
      To paint those charms which varied as they beamed--
      To such as see thee not my words were weak;
    To those who gaze on thee what language could they speak?

    Ah! may'st thou ever be what now thou art,
      Nor unbeseem the promise of thy Spring--
      As fair in form, as warm yet pure in heart,
      Love's image upon earth without his wing,
      And guileless beyond Hope's imagining!
      And surely she who now so fondly rears
      Thy youth, in thee, thus hourly brightening,
      Beholds the Rainbow of her future years,
    Before whose heavenly hues all Sorrow disappears.

    Young Peri of the West!--'tis well for me
      My years already doubly number thine;
      My loveless eye unmoved may gaze on thee,
      And safely view thy ripening beauties shine;
      Happy, I ne'er shall see them in decline;
      Happier, that, while all younger hearts shall bleed,
      Mine shall escape the doom thine eyes assign
      To those whose admiration shall succeed,
    But mixed with pangs to Love's even loveliest hours decreed.

    Oh! let that eye, which, wild as the Gazelle's,
      Now brightly bold or beautifully shy,
      Wins as it wanders, dazzles where it dwells,
      Glance o'er this page, nor to my verse deny
      That smile for which my breast might vainly sigh
      Could I to thee be ever more than friend:
      This much, dear Maid, accord; nor question why
      To one so young my strain I would commend,
    But bid me with my wreath one matchless Lily blend.

    Such is thy name with this my verse entwined;
      And long as kinder eyes a look shall cast
      On Harold's page, Ianthe's here enshrined
      Shall thus be first beheld, forgotten last:
      My days once numbered--should this homage past
      Attract thy fairy fingers near the Lyre
      Of him who hailed thee loveliest, as thou wast--
      Such is the most my Memory may desire;
    Though more than Hope can claim, could Friendship less require?

                       CHILDE HAROLD'S PILGRIMAGE.

                                A ROMAUNT.

                             CANTO THE FIRST.

                             I.

    Oh, thou! in Hellas deemed of heavenly birth,
      Muse! formed or fabled at the Minstrel's will!
      Since shamed full oft by later lyres on earth,
      Mine dares not call thee from thy sacred Hill:
      Yet there I've wandered by thy vaunted rill;
      Yes! sighed o'er Delphi's long deserted shrine,
      Where, save that feeble fountain, all is still;
      Nor mote my shell awake the weary Nine
    To grace so plain a tale--this lowly lay of mine.

                              II.

    Whilome in Albion's isle there dwelt a youth,
      Who ne in Virtue's ways did take delight;
      But spent his days in riot most uncouth,
      And vexed with mirth the drowsy ear of Night.
      Ah me! in sooth he was a shameless wight,
      Sore given to revel and ungodly glee;
      Few earthly things found favour in his sight
      Save concubines and carnal companie,
    And flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.

                              III.

    Childe Harold was he hight:--but whence his name
      And lineage long, it suits me not to say;
      Suffice it, that perchance they were of fame,
      And had been glorious in another day:
      But one sad losel soils a name for ay,
      However mighty in the olden time;
      Nor all that heralds rake from coffined clay,
      Nor florid prose, nor honied lies of rhyme,
    Can blazon evil deeds, or consecrate a crime.

                              IV.

    Childe Harold basked him in the Noontide sun,
      Disporting there like any other fly;
      Nor deemed before his little day was done
      One blast might chill him into misery.
      But long ere scarce a third of his passed by,
      Worse than Adversity the Childe befell;
      He felt the fulness of Satiety:
      Then loathed he in his native land to dwell,
    Which seemed to him more lone than Eremite's sad cell.

                               V.

    For he through Sin's long labyrinth had run,
      Nor made atonement when he did amiss,
      Had sighed to many though he loved but one,
      And that loved one, alas! could ne'er be his.
      Ah, happy she! to 'scape from him whose kiss
      Had been pollution unto aught so chaste;
      Who soon had left her charms for vulgar bliss,
      And spoiled her goodly lands to gild his waste,
    Nor calm domestic peace had ever deigned to taste.

                              VI.

    And now Childe Harold was sore sick at heart,
      And from his fellow Bacchanals would flee;
      'Tis said, at times the sullen tear would start,
      But Pride congealed the drop within his ee:
      Apart he stalked in joyless reverie,
      And from his native land resolved to go,
      And visit scorching climes beyond the sea;
      With pleasure drugged, he almost longed for woe,
    And e'en for change of scene would seek the shades below.

                              VII.

    The Childe departed from his father's hall:
      It was a vast and venerable pile;
      So old, it seemed only not to fall,
      Yet strength was pillared in each massy aisle.
      Monastic dome! condemned to uses vile!
      Where Superstition once had made her den
      Now Paphian girls were known to sing and smile;
      And monks might deem their time was come agen,
    If ancient tales say true, nor wrong these holy men.

                            VIII.

    Yet oft-times in his maddest mirthful mood
      Strange pangs would flash along Childe Harold's brow,
      As if the Memory of some deadly feud
      Or disappointed passion lurked below:
      But this none knew, nor haply cared to know;
      For his was not that open, artless soul
      That feels relief by bidding sorrow flow,
      Nor sought he friend to counsel or condole,
    Whate'er this grief mote be, which he could not control.

                            IX.

    And none did love him!--though to hall and bower
      He gathered revellers from far and near,
      He knew them flatterers of the festal hour,
      The heartless Parasites of present cheer.
      Yea! none did love him--not his lemans dear--
      But pomp and power alone are Woman's care,
      And where these are light Eros finds a feere;
      Maidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare,
    And Mammon wins his way where Seraphs might despair.

                               X.

    Childe Harold had a mother--not forgot,
      Though parting from that mother he did shun;
      A sister whom he loved, but saw her not
      Before his weary pilgrimage begun:
      If friends he had, he bade adieu to none.
      Yet deem not thence his breast a breast of steel:
      Ye, who have known what 'tis to dote upon
      A few dear objects, will in sadness feel
    Such partings break the heart they fondly hope to heal.

                              XI.

    His house, his home, his heritage, his lands,
      The laughing dames in whom he did delight,
      Whose large blue eyes, fair locks, and snowy hands,
      Might shake the Saintship of an Anchorite,
      And long had fed his youthful appetite;
      His goblets brimmed with every costly wine,
      And all that mote to luxury invite,
      Without a sigh he left, to cross the brine,
    And traverse Paynim shores, and pass Earth's central line.

                              XII.

    The sails were filled, and fair the light winds blew,
      As glad to waft him from his native home;
      And fast the white rocks faded from his view,
      And soon were lost in circumambient foam:
      And then, it may be, of his wish to roam
      Repented he, but in his bosom slept
      The silent thought, nor from his lips did come
      One word of wail, whilst others sate and wept,
    And to the reckless gales unmanly moaning kept.

                             XIII.

    But when the Sun was sinking in the sea
      He seized his harp, which he at times could string,
      And strike, albeit with untaught melody,
      When deemed he no strange ear was listening:
      And now his fingers o'er it he did fling,
      And tuned his farewell in the dim twilight;
      While flew the vessel on her snowy wing,
      And fleeting shores receded from his sight,
    Thus to the elements he poured his last "Good Night."

                       CHILDE HAROLD'S GOOD NIGHT.

                               1.

    "Adieu, adieu! my native shore
      Fades o'er the waters blue;
    The night-winds sigh, the breakers roar,
      And shrieks the wild sea-mew.
    Yon Sun that sets upon the sea
      We follow in his flight;
    Farewell awhile to him and thee,
      My native Land--Good Night!

                               2.

    "A few short hours and He will rise
      To give the Morrow birth;
    And I shall hail the main and skies,
      But not my mother Earth.
    Deserted is my own good Hall,
      Its hearth is desolate;
    Wild weeds are gathering on the wall;
      My Dog howls at the gate.

                               3.

    "Come hither, hither, my little page
      Why dost thou weep and wail?
    Or dost thou dread the billows' rage,
      Or tremble at the gale?
    But dash the tear-drop from thine eye;
      Our ship is swift and strong:
    Our fleetest falcon scarce can fly
      More merrily along."

                               4.

    "Let winds be shrill, let waves roll high,
      I fear not wave nor wind:
    Yet marvel not, Sir Childe, that I
      Am sorrowful in mind;
    For I have from my father gone,
      A mother whom I love,
    And have no friend, save these alone,
      But thee--and One above.

                               5.

    'My father blessed me fervently,
      Yet did not much complain;
    But sorely will my mother sigh
      Till I come back again.'--
    "Enough, enough, my little lad!
      Such tears become thine eye;
    If I thy guileless bosom had,
      Mine own would not be dry.

                               6.

    "Come hither, hither, my staunch yeoman,
      Why dost thou look so pale?
    Or dost thou dread a French foeman?
      Or shiver at the gale?"--
    'Deem'st thou I tremble for my life?
      Sir Childe, I'm not so weak;
    But thinking on an absent wife
      Will blanch a faithful cheek.

                               7.

    'My spouse and boys dwell near thy hall,
      Along the bordering Lake,
    And when they on their father call,
      What answer shall she make?'--
    "Enough, enough, my yeoman good,
      Thy grief let none gainsay;
    But I, who am of lighter mood,
      Will laugh to flee away.

                               8.

    "For who would trust the seeming sighs
      Of wife or paramour?
    Fresh feeres will dry the bright blue eyes
      We late saw streaming o'er.
    For pleasures past I do not grieve,
      Nor perils gathering near;
    My greatest grief is that I leave
      No thing that claims a tear.

                               9.

    "And now I'm in the world alone,
      Upon the wide, wide sea:
    But why should I for others groan,
      When none will sigh for me?
    Perchance my Dog will whine in vain,
      Till fed by stranger hands;
    But long ere I come back again,
      He'd tear me where he stands.

                              10.

    "With thee, my bark, I'll swiftly go
      Athwart the foaming brine;
    Nor care what land thou bear'st me to,
      So not again to mine.
    Welcome, welcome, ye dark-blue waves!
      And when you fail my sight,
    Welcome, ye deserts, and ye caves!
      My native Land--Good Night!"

                              XIV.

    On, on the vessel flies, the land is gone,
      And winds are rude in Biscay's sleepless bay.
      Four days are sped, but with the fifth, anon,
      New shores descried make every bosom gay;
      And Cintra's mountain greets them on their way,
      And Tagus dashing onward to the Deep,
      His fabled golden tribute bent to pay;
      And soon on board the Lusian pilots leap,
    And steer 'twixt fertile shores where yet few rustics reap.

                              XV.

    Oh, Christ! it is a goodly sight to see
      What Heaven hath done for this delicious land!
      What fruits of fragrance blush on every tree!
      What goodly prospects o'er the hills expand!
      But man would mar them with an impious hand:
      And when the Almighty lifts his fiercest scourge
      'Gainst those who most transgress his high command,
      With treble vengeance will his hot shafts urge
    Gaul's locust host, and earth from fellest foemen purge

                              XVI.

    What beauties doth Lisboa first unfold!
      Her image floating on that noble tide,
      Which poets vainly pave with sands of gold,
      But now whereon a thousand keels did ride
      Of mighty strength, since Albion was allied,
      And to the Lusians did her aid afford:
      A nation swoln with ignorance and pride,
      Who lick yet loathe the hand that waves the sword
    To save them from the wrath of Gaul's unsparing lord.

                             XVII.

    But whoso entereth within this town,
      That, sheening far, celestial seems to be,
      Disconsolate will wander up and down,
      'Mid many things unsightly to strange ee;
      For hut and palace show like filthily:
      The dingy denizens are reared in dirt;
      Ne personage of high or mean degree
      Doth care for cleanness of surtout or shirt,
    Though shent with Egypt's plague, unkempt, unwashed, unhurt.

                             XVIII.

    Poor, paltry slaves! yet born 'midst noblest scenes--
      Why, Nature, waste thy wonders on such men?
      Lo! Cintra's glorious Eden intervenes
      In variegated maze of mount and glen.
      Ah, me! what hand can pencil guide, or pen,
      To follow half on which the eye dilates
      Through views more dazzling unto mortal ken
      Than those whereof such things the Bard relates,
    Who to the awe-struck world unlocked Elysium's gates.

                              XIX.

    The horrid crags, by toppling convent crowned,
      The cork-trees hoar that clothe the shaggy steep,
      The mountain-moss by scorching skies imbrowned,
      The sunken glen, whose sunless shrubs must weep,
      The tender azure of the unruffled deep,
      The orange tints that gild the greenest bough,
      The torrents that from cliff to valley leap,
      The vine on high, the willow branch below,
    Mixed in one mighty scene, with varied beauty glow.

                              XX.

    Then slowly climb the many-winding way,
      And frequent turn to linger as you go,
      From loftier rocks new loveliness survey,
      And rest ye at "Our Lady's house of Woe;"
      Where frugal monks their little relics show,
      And sundry legends to the stranger tell:
      Here impious men have punished been, and lo!
      Deep in yon cave Honorius long did dwell,
    In hope to merit Heaven by making earth a Hell.

                              XXI.

    And here and there, as up the crags you spring,
      Mark many rude-carved crosses near the path:
      Yet deem not these Devotion's offering--
      These are memorials frail of murderous wrath:
      For wheresoe'er the shrieking victim hath
      Pour'd forth his blood beneath the assassin's knife,
      Some hand erects a cross of mouldering lath;
      And grove and glen with thousand such are rife
    Throughout this purple land, where Law secures not life.

                             XXII.

    On sloping mounds, or in the vale beneath,
      Are domes where whilome kings did make repair;
      But now the wild flowers round them only breathe:
      Yet ruined Splendour still is lingering there.
      And yonder towers the Prince's palace fair:
      There thou too, Vathek! England's wealthiest son,
      Once formed thy Paradise, as not aware
      When wanton Wealth her mightiest deeds hath done,
    Meek Peace voluptuous lures was ever wont to shun.

                             XXIII.

    Here didst thou dwell, here schemes of pleasure plan,
      Beneath yon mountain's ever beauteous brow:
      But now, as if a thing unblest by Man,
      Thy fairy dwelling is as lone as Thou!
      Here giant weeds a passage scarce allow
      To Halls deserted, portals gaping wide:
      Fresh lessons to the thinking bosom, how
      Vain are the pleasaunces on earth supplied;
    Swept into wrecks anon by Time's ungentle tide!

                             XXIV.

    Behold the hall where chiefs were late convened!
      Oh! dome displeasing unto British eye!
      With diadem hight Foolscap, lo! a Fiend,
      A little Fiend that scoffs incessantly,
      There sits in parchment robe arrayed, and by
      His side is hung a seal and sable scroll,
      Where blazoned glare names known to chivalry,
      And sundry signatures adorn the roll,
    Whereat the Urchin points and laughs with all his soul.

                              XXV.

    Convention is the dwarfish demon styled
      That foiled the knights in Marialva's dome:
      Of brains (if brains they had) he them beguiled,
      And turned a nation's shallow joy to gloom.
      Here Folly dashed to earth the victor's plume,
      And Policy regained what arms had lost:
      For chiefs like ours in vain may laurels bloom!
      Woe to the conquering, not the conquered host,
    Since baffled Triumph droops on Lusitania's coast.

                             XXVI.

    And ever since that martial Synod met,
      Britannia sickens, Cintra! at thy name;
      And folks in office at the mention fret,
      And fain would blush, if blush they could, for shame.
      How will Posterity the deed proclaim!
      Will not our own and fellow-nations sneer,
      To view these champions cheated of their fame,
      By foes in fight o'erthrown, yet victors here,
    Where Scorn her finger points through many a coming year?

                             XXVII.

    So deemed the Childe, as o'er the mountains he
      Did take his way in solitary guise:
      Sweet was the scene, yet soon he thought to flee,
      More restless than the swallow in the skies:
      Though here awhile he learned to moralise,
      For Meditation fixed at times on him;
      And conscious Reason whispered to despise
      His early youth, misspent in maddest whim;
    But as he gazed on truth his aching eyes grew dim.

                            XXVIII.

    To horse! to horse! he quits, for ever quits
      A scene of peace, though soothing to his soul:
      Again he rouses from his moping fits,
      But seeks not now the harlot and the bowl.
      Onward he flies, nor fixed as yet the goal
      Where he shall rest him on his pilgrimage;
      And o'er him many changing scenes must roll
      Ere toil his thirst for travel can assuage,
    Or he shall calm his breast, or learn experience sage.

                             XXIX.

    Yet Mafra shall one moment claim delay,
      Where dwelt of yore the Lusians' luckless queen;
      And Church and Court did mingle their array,
      And Mass and revel were alternate seen;
      Lordlings and freres--ill-sorted fry I ween!
      But here the Babylonian Whore hath built
      A dome, where flaunts she in such glorious sheen,
      That men forget the blood which she hath spilt,
    And bow the knee to Pomp that loves to varnish guilt.

                              XXX.

    O'er vales that teem with fruits, romantic hills,
      (Oh, that such hills upheld a freeborn race!)
      Whereon to gaze the eye with joyaunce fills,
      Childe Harold wends through many a pleasant place.
      Though sluggards deem it but a foolish chase,
      And marvel men should quit their easy chair,
      The toilsome way, and long, long league to trace,
      Oh! there is sweetness in the mountain air,
    And Life, that bloated Ease can never hope to share.

                             XXXI.

    More bleak to view the hills at length recede,
      And, less luxuriant, smoother vales extend:
      Immense horizon-bounded plains succeed!
      Far as the eye discerns, withouten end,
      Spain's realms appear whereon her shepherds tend
      Flocks, whose rich fleece right well the trader knows--
      Now must the Pastor's arm his lambs defend:
      For Spain is compassed by unyielding foes,
    And all must shield their all, or share Subjection's woes.

                             XXXII.

    Where Lusitania and her Sister meet,
      Deem ye what bounds the rival realms divide?
      Or ere the jealous Queens of Nations greet,
      Doth Tayo interpose his mighty tide?
      Or dark Sierras rise in craggy pride?
      Or fence of art, like China's vasty wall?--
      Ne barrier wall, ne river deep and wide,
      Ne horrid crags, nor mountains dark and tall,
    Rise like the rocks that part Hispania's land from Gaul:

                            XXXIII.

    But these between a silver streamlet glides,
      And scarce a name distinguisheth the brook,
      Though rival kingdoms press its verdant sides:
      Here leans the idle shepherd on his crook,
      And vacant on the rippling waves doth look,
      That peaceful still 'twixt bitterest foemen flow;
      For proud each peasant as the noblest duke:
      Well doth the Spanish hind the difference know
    'Twixt him and Lusian slave, the lowest of the low.

                             XXXIV.

    But ere the mingling bounds have far been passed,
      Dark Guadiana rolls his power along
      In sullen billows, murmuring and vast,
      So noted ancient roundelays among.
      Whilome upon his banks did legions throng
      Of Moor and Knight, in mailed splendour drest:
      Here ceased the swift their race, here sunk the strong;
      The Paynim turban and the Christian crest
    Mixed on the bleeding stream, by floating hosts oppressed.

                             XXXV.

    Oh, lovely Spain! renowned, romantic Land!
      Where is that standard which Pelagio bore,
      When Cava's traitor-sire first called the band
      That dyed thy mountain streams with Gothic gore?
      Where are those bloody Banners which of yore
      Waved o'er thy sons, victorious to the gale,
      And drove at last the spoilers to their shore?
      Red gleamed the Cross, and waned the Crescent pale,
    While Afric's echoes thrilled with Moorish matrons' wail.

                             XXXVI.

    Teems not each ditty with the glorious tale?
      Ah! such, alas! the hero's amplest fate!
      When granite moulders and when records fail,
      A peasant's plaint prolongs his dubious date.
      Pride! bend thine eye from Heaven to thine estate,
      See how the Mighty shrink into a song!
      Can Volume, Pillar, Pile preserve thee great?
      Or must thou trust Tradition's simple tongue,
    When Flattery sleeps with thee, and History does thee wrong?

                            XXXVII.

    Awake, ye Sons of Spain! awake! advance!
      Lo! Chivalry, your ancient Goddess, cries,
      But wields not, as of old, her thirsty lance,
      Nor shakes her crimson plumage in the skies:
      Now on the smoke of blazing bolts she flies,
      And speaks in thunder through yon engine's roar:
      In every peal she calls--"Awake! arise!"
      Say, is her voice more feeble than of yore,
    When her war-song was heard on Andalusia's shore?

                            XXXVIII.

    Hark!--heard you not those hoofs of dreadful note?
      Sounds not the clang of conflict on the heath?
      Saw ye not whom the reeking sabre smote,
      Nor saved your brethren ere they sank beneath
      Tyrants and Tyrants' slaves?--the fires of Death,
      The Bale-fires flash on high:--from rock to rock!
      Each volley tells that thousands cease to breathe;
      Death rides upon the sulphury Siroc,
    Red Battle stamps his foot, and Nations feel the shock.

                             XXXIX.

    Lo! where the Giant on the mountain stands,
      His blood-red tresses deepening in the Sun,
      With death-shot glowing in his fiery hands,
      And eye that scorcheth all it glares upon;
      Restless it rolls, now fixed, and now anon
      Flashing afar,--and at his iron feet
      Destruction cowers, to mark what deeds are done;
      For on this morn three potent Nations meet,
    To shed before his Shrine the blood he deems most sweet.

                              XL.

    By Heaven! it is a splendid sight to see
      (For one who hath no friend, no brother there)
      Their rival scarfs of mixed embroidery,
      Their various arms that glitter in the air!
      What gallant War-hounds rouse them from their lair,
      And gnash their fangs, loud yelling for the prey!
      All join the chase, but few the triumph share;
      The Grave shall bear the chiefest prize away,
    And Havoc scarce for joy can number their array.

                              XLI.

    Three hosts combine to offer sacrifice;
      Three tongues prefer strange orisons on high;
      Three gaudy standards flout the pale blue skies;
      The shouts are France, Spain, Albion, Victory!
      The Foe, the Victim, and the fond Ally
      That fights for all, but ever fights in vain,
      Are met--as if at home they could not die--
      To feed the crow on Talavera's plain,
    And fertilise the field that each pretends to gain.

                             XLII.

    There shall they rot--Ambition's honoured fools!
      Yes, Honour decks the turf that wraps their clay!
      Vain Sophistry! in these behold the tools,
      The broken tools, that Tyrants cast away
      By myriads, when they dare to pave their way
      With human hearts--to what?--a dream alone.
      Can Despots compass aught that hails their sway?
      Or call with truth one span of earth their own,
    Save that wherein at last they crumble bone by bone?

                             XLIII.

    Oh, Albuera! glorious field of grief!
      As o'er thy plain the Pilgrim pricked his steed,
      Who could foresee thee, in a space so brief,
      A scene where mingling foes should boast and bleed!
      Peace to the perished! may the warrior's meed
      And tears of triumph their reward prolong!
      Till others fall where other chieftains lead
      Thy name shall circle round the gaping throng,
    And shine in worthless lays, the theme of transient song.

                             XLIV.

    Enough of Battle's minions! let them play
      Their game of lives, and barter breath for fame:
      Fame that will scarce reanimate their clay,
      Though thousands fall to deck some single name.
      In sooth 'twere sad to thwart their noble aim
      Who strike, blest hirelings! for their country's good,
      And die, that living might have proved her shame;
      Perished, perchance, in some domestic feud,
    Or in a narrower sphere wild Rapine's path pursued.

                              XLV.

    Full swiftly Harold wends his lonely way
      Where proud Sevilla triumphs unsubdued:
      Yet is she free? the Spoiler's wished-for prey!
      Soon, soon shall Conquest's fiery foot intrude,
      Blackening her lovely domes with traces rude.
      Inevitable hour! 'Gainst fate to strive
      Where Desolation plants her famished brood
      Is vain, or Ilion, Tyre might yet survive,
    And Virtue vanquish all, and Murder cease to thrive

                             XLVI.

    But all unconscious of the coming doom,
      The feast, the song, the revel here abounds;
      Strange modes of merriment the hours consume,
      Nor bleed these patriots with their country's wounds:
      Nor here War's clarion, but Love's rebeck sounds;
      Here Folly still his votaries inthralls;
      And young-eyed Lewdness walks her midnight rounds:
      Girt with the silent crimes of Capitals,
    Still to the last kind Vice clings to the tott'ring walls.

                             XLVII.

    Not so the rustic--with his trembling mate
      He lurks, nor casts his heavy eye afar,
      Lest he should view his vineyard desolate,
      Blasted below the dun hot breath of War.
      No more beneath soft Eve's consenting star
      Fandango twirls his jocund castanet:
      Ah, Monarchs! could ye taste the mirth ye mar,
      Not in the toils of Glory would ye fret;
    The hoarse dull drum would sleep, and Man be happy yet!

                            XLVIII.

    How carols now the lusty muleteer?
      Of Love, Romance, Devotion is his lay,
      As whilome he was wont the leagues to cheer,
      His quick bells wildly jingling on the way?
      No! as he speeds, he chants "Viva el Rey!"
      And checks his song to execrate Godoy,
      The royal wittol Charles, and curse the day
      When first Spain's queen beheld the black-eyed boy,
    And gore-faced Treason sprung from her adulterate joy.

                             XLIX.

    On yon long level plain, at distance crowned
      With crags, whereon those Moorish turrets rest,
      Wide-scattered hoof-marks dint the wounded ground;
      And, scathed by fire, the greensward's darkened vest
      Tells that the foe was Andalusia's guest:
      Here was the camp, the watch-flame, and the host,
      Here the bold peasant stormed the Dragon's nest;
      Still does he mark it with triumphant boast,
    And points to yonder cliffs, which oft were won and lost.

                               L.

    And whomsoe'er along the path you meet
      Bears in his cap the badge of crimson hue,
      Which tells you whom to shun and whom to greet:
      Woe to the man that walks in public view
      Without of loyalty this token true:
      Sharp is the knife, and sudden is the stroke;
      And sorely would the Gallic foeman rue,
      If subtle poniards, wrapt beneath the cloke,
    Could blunt the sabre's edge, or clear the cannon's smoke.

                              LI.

    At every turn Morena's dusky height
      Sustains aloft the battery's iron load;
      And, far as mortal eye can compass sight,
      The mountain-howitzer, the broken road,
      The bristling palisade, the fosse o'erflowed,
      The stationed bands, the never-vacant watch,
      The magazine in rocky durance stowed,
      The bolstered steed beneath the shed of thatch,
    The ball-piled pyramid, the ever-blazing match,

                              LII.

    Portend the deeds to come:--but he whose nod
      Has tumbled feebler despots from their sway,
      A moment pauseth ere he lifts the rod;
      A little moment deigneth to delay:
      Soon will his legions sweep through these their way;
      The West must own the Scourger of the world.
      Ah! Spain! how sad will be thy reckoning-day,
      When soars Gaul's Vulture, with his wings unfurled,
    And thou shall view thy sons in crowds to Hades hurled.

                             LIII.

    And must they fall? the young, the proud, the brave,
      To swell one bloated Chiefs unwholesome reign?
      No step between submission and a grave?
      The rise of Rapine and the fall of Spain?
      And doth the Power that man adores ordain
      Their doom, nor heed the suppliant's appeal?
      Is all that desperate Valour acts in vain?
      And Counsel sage, and patriotic Zeal--
    The Veteran's skill--Youth's fire--and Manhood's heart of steel?

                              LIV.

    Is it for this the Spanish maid, aroused,
      Hangs on the willow her unstrung guitar,
      And, all unsexed, the Anlace hath espoused,
      Sung the loud song, and dared the deed of war?
      And she, whom once the semblance of a scar
      Appalled, an owlet's 'larum chilled with dread,
      Now views the column-scattering bay'net jar,
      The falchion flash, and o'er the yet warm dead
    Stalks with Minerva's step where Mars might quake to tread.

                              LV.

    Ye who shall marvel when you hear her tale,
      Oh! had you known her in her softer hour,
      Marked her black eye that mocks her coal-black veil,
      Heard her light, lively tones in Lady's bower,
      Seen her long locks that foil the painter's power,
      Her fairy form, with more than female grace,
      Scarce would you deem that Saragoza's tower
      Beheld her smile in Danger's Gorgon face,
    Thin the closed ranks, and lead in Glory's fearful chase.

                              LVI.

    Her lover sinks--she sheds no ill-timed tear;
      Her Chief is slain--she fills his fatal post;
      Her fellows flee--she checks their base career;
      The Foe retires--she heads the sallying host:
      Who can appease like her a lover's ghost?
      Who can avenge so well a leader's fall?
      What maid retrieve when man's flushed hope is lost?
      Who hang so fiercely on the flying Gaul,
    Foiled by a woman's hand, before a battered wall?

                             LVII.

    Yet are Spain's maids no race of Amazons,
      But formed for all the witching arts of love:
      Though thus in arms they emulate her sons,
      And in the horrid phalanx dare to move,
      'Tis but the tender fierceness of the dove,
      Pecking the hand that hovers o'er her mate:
      In softness as in firmness far above
      Remoter females, famed for sickening prate;
    Her mind is nobler sure, her charms perchance as great.

                             LVIII.

    The seal Love's dimpling finger hath impressed
      Denotes how soft that chin which bears his touch:
      Her lips, whose kisses pout to leave their nest,
      Bid man be valiant ere he merit such:
      Her glance how wildly beautiful! how much
      Hath Phoebus wooed in vain to spoil her cheek,
      Which glows yet smoother from his amorous clutch!
      Who round the North for paler dames would seek?
    How poor their forms appear! how languid, wan, and weak!

                              LIX.

    Match me, ye climes! which poets love to laud;
      Match me, ye harems of the land! where now
      I strike my strain, far distant, to applaud
      Beauties that ev'n a cynic must avow;
      Match me those Houries, whom ye scarce allow
      To taste the gale lest Love should ride the wind,
      With Spain's dark-glancing daughters--deign to know,
      There your wise Prophet's Paradise we find,
    His black-eyed maids of Heaven, angelically kind.

                              LX.

    Oh, thou Parnassus! whom I now survey,
      Not in the phrensy of a dreamer's eye,
      Not in the fabled landscape of a lay,
      But soaring snow-clad through thy native sky,
      In the wild pomp of mountain-majesty!
      What marvel if I thus essay to sing?
      The humblest of thy pilgrims passing by
      Would gladly woo thine Echoes with his string,
    Though from thy heights no more one Muse will wave her wing.

                              LXI.

    Oft have I dreamed of Thee! whose glorious name
      Who knows not, knows not man's divinest lore:
      And now I view thee--'tis, alas, with shame
      That I in feeblest accents must adore.
      When I recount thy worshippers of yore
      I tremble, and can only bend the knee;
      Nor raise my voice, nor vainly dare to soar,
      But gaze beneath thy cloudy canopy
    In silent joy to think at last I look on Thee!

                             LXII.

    Happier in this than mightiest Bards have been,
      Whose Fate to distant homes confined their lot,
      Shall I unmoved behold the hallowed scene,
      Which others rave of, though they know it not?
      Though here no more Apollo haunts his Grot,
      And thou, the Muses' seat, art now their grave,
      Some gentle Spirit still pervades the spot,
      Sighs in the gale, keeps silence in the Cave,
    And glides with glassy foot o'er yon melodious wave.

                             LXIII.

    Of thee hereafter.--Ev'n amidst my strain
      I turned aside to pay my homage here;
      Forgot the land, the sons, the maids of Spain;
      Her fate, to every freeborn bosom dear;
      And hailed thee, not perchance without a tear.
      Now to my theme--but from thy holy haunt
      Let me some remnant, some memorial bear;
      Yield me one leaf of Daphne's deathless plant,
    Nor let thy votary's hope be deemed an idle vaunt.

                             LXIV.

    But ne'er didst thou, fair Mount! when Greece was young,
      See round thy giant base a brighter choir,
      Nor e'er did Delphi, when her Priestess sung
      The Pythian hymn with more than mortal fire,
      Behold a train more fitting to inspire
      The song of love, than Andalusia's maids,
      Nurst in the glowing lap of soft Desire:
      Ah! that to these were given such peaceful shades
    As Greece can still bestow, though Glory fly her glades.

                              LXV.

    Fair is proud Seville; let her country boast
      Her strength, her wealth, her site of ancient days;
      But Cadiz, rising on the distant coast,
      Calls forth a sweeter, though ignoble praise.
      Ah, Vice! how soft are thy voluptuous ways!
      While boyish blood is mantling, who can 'scape
      The fascination of thy magic gaze?
      A Cherub-Hydra round us dost thou gape,
    And mould to every taste thy dear delusive shape.

                             LXVI.

    When Paphos fell by Time--accursed Time!
      The Queen who conquers all must yield to thee--
      The Pleasures fled, but sought as warm a clime;
      And Venus, constant to her native Sea,
      To nought else constant, hither deigned to flee,
      And fixed her shrine within these walls of white:
      Though not to one dome circumscribeth She
      Her worship, but, devoted to her rite,
    A thousand Altars rise, for ever blazing bright.

                             LXVII.

    From morn till night, from night till startled Morn
      Peeps blushing on the Revel's laughing crew,
      The Song is heard, the rosy Garland worn;
      Devices quaint, and Frolics ever new,
      Tread on each other's kibes. A long adieu
      He bids to sober joy that here sojourns:
      Nought interrupts the riot, though in lieu
      Of true devotion monkish incense burns,
    And Love and Prayer unite, or rule the hour by turns.

                            LXVIII.

    The Sabbath comes, a day of blessed rest:
      What hallows it upon this Christian shore?
      Lo! it is sacred to a solemn Feast:
      Hark! heard you not the forest-monarch's roar?
      Crashing the lance, he snuffs the spouting gore
      Of man and steed, o'erthrown beneath his horn;
      The thronged arena shakes with shouts for more;
      Yells the mad crowd o'er entrails freshly torn,
    Nor shrinks the female eye, nor ev'n affects to mourn.

                           LXIX.

    The seventh day this--the Jubilee of man!
      London! right well thou know'st the day of prayer:
      Then thy spruce citizen, washed artisan,
      And smug apprentice gulp their weekly air:
      Thy coach of hackney, whiskey, one-horse chair,
      And humblest gig through sundry suburbs whirl,
      To Hampstead, Brentford, Harrow make repair;
      Till the tired jade the wheel forgets to hurl,
    Provoking envious gibe from each pedestrian churl.

                              LXX.

    Some o'er thy Thamis row the ribboned fair,
      Others along the safer turnpike fly;
      Some Richmond-hill ascend, some scud to Ware,
      And many to the steep of Highgate hie.
      Ask ye, Boeotian Shades! the reason why?
      'Tis to the worship of the solemn Horn,
      Grasped in the holy hand of Mystery,
      In whose dread name both men and maids are sworn,
    And consecrate the oath with draught, and dance till morn.

                             LXXI.

    All have their fooleries--not alike are thine,
      Fair Cadiz, rising o'er the dark blue sea!
      Soon as the Matin bell proclaimeth nine,
      Thy Saint-adorers count the Rosary:
      Much is the VIRGIN teased to shrive them free
      (Well do I ween the only virgin there)
      From crimes as numerous as her beadsmen be;
      Then to the crowded circus forth they fare:
    Young, old, high, low, at once the same diversion share.

                             LXXII.

    The lists are oped, the spacious area cleared,
      Thousands on thousands piled are seated round;
      Long ere the first loud trumpet's note is heard,
      Ne vacant space for lated wight is found:
      Here Dons, Grandees, but chiefly Dames abound,
      Skilled in the ogle of a roguish eye,
      Yet ever well inclined to heal the wound;
      None through their cold disdain are doomed to die,
    As moon-struck bards complain, by Love's sad archery.

                            LXXIII.

    Hushed is the din of tongues--on gallant steeds,
      With milk-white crest, gold spur, and light-poised lance,
      Four cavaliers prepare for venturous deeds,
      And lowly-bending to the lists advance;
      Rich are their scarfs, their chargers featly prance:
      If in the dangerous game they shine to-day,
      The crowd's loud shout and ladies' lovely glance,
      Best prize of better acts! they bear away,
    And all that kings or chiefs e'er gain their toils repay.

                             LXXIV.

    In costly sheen and gaudy cloak arrayed.
      But all afoot, the light-limbed Matadore
      Stands in the centre, eager to invade
      The lord of lowing herds; but not before
      The ground, with cautious tread, is traversed o'er,
      Lest aught unseen should lurk to thwart his speed:
      His arms a dart, he fights aloof, nor more
      Can Man achieve without the friendly steed--
    Alas! too oft condemned for him to bear and bleed.

                             LXXV.

    Thrice sounds the Clarion; lo! the signal falls,
      The den expands, and Expectation mute
      Gapes round the silent circle's peopled walls.
      Bounds with one lashing spring the mighty brute,
      And, wildly staring, spurns, with sounding foot,
      The sand, nor blindly rushes on his foe:
      Here, there, he points his threatening front, to suit
      His first attack, wide-waving to and fro
    His angry tail; red rolls his eye's dilated glow.

                             LXXVI.

    Sudden he stops--his eye is fixed--away--
      Away, thou heedless boy! prepare the spear:
      Now is thy time, to perish, or display
      The skill that yet may check his mad career!
      With well-timed croupe the nimble coursers veer;
      On foams the Bull, but not unscathed he goes;
      Streams from his flank the crimson torrent clear:
      He flies, he wheels, distracted with his throes;
    Dart follows dart--lance, lance--loud bellowings speak his woes.

                            LXXVII.

    Again he comes; nor dart nor lance avail,
      Nor the wild plunging of the tortured horse;
      Though Man and Man's avenging arms assail,
      Vain are his weapons, vainer is his force.
      One gallant steed is stretched a mangled corse;
      Another, hideous sight! unseamed appears,
      His gory chest unveils life's panting source;
      Though death-struck, still his feeble frame he rears;
    Staggering, but stemming all, his Lord unharmed he bears.

                            LXXVIII.

    Foiled, bleeding, breathless, furious to the last,
      Full in the centre stands the Bull at bay,
      Mid wounds, and clinging darts, and lances brast,
      And foes disabled in the brutal fray:
      And now the Matadores around him play,
      Shake the red cloak, and poise the ready brand:
      Once more through all he bursts his thundering way--
      Vain rage! the mantle quits the conynge hand,
    Wraps his fierce eye--'tis past--he sinks upon the sand!

                             LXXIX.

    Where his vast neck just mingles with the spine,
      Sheathed in his form the deadly weapon lies.
      He stops--he starts--disdaining to decline:
      Slowly he falls, amidst triumphant cries,
      Without a groan, without a struggle dies.
      The decorated car appears--on high
      The corse is piled--sweet sight for vulgar eyes--
      Four steeds that spurn the rein, as swift as shy,
    Hurl the dark bulk along, scarce seen in dashing by.

                             LXXX.

    Such the ungentle sport that oft invites
      The Spanish maid, and cheers the Spanish swain.
      Nurtured in blood betimes, his heart delights
      In vengeance, gloating on another's pain.
      What private feuds the troubled village stain!
      Though now one phalanxed host should meet the foe,
      Enough, alas! in humble homes remain,
      To meditate 'gainst friend the secret blow,
   For some slight cause of wrath, whence Life's warm stream must flow.

                             LXXXI.

    But Jealousy has fled: his bars, his bolts,
      His withered Centinel, Duenna sage!
      And all whereat the generous soul revolts,
      Which the stern dotard deemed he could encage,
      Have passed to darkness with the vanished age.
      Who late so free as Spanish girls were seen,
      (Ere War uprose in his volcanic rage,)
      With braided tresses bounding o'er the green,
    While on the gay dance shone Night's lover-loving Queen?

                            LXXXII.

    Oh! many a time and oft, had Harold loved,
      Or dreamed he loved, since Rapture is a dream;
      But now his wayward bosom was unmoved,
      For not yet had he drunk of Lethe's stream;
      And lately had he learned with truth to deem
      Love has no gift so grateful as his wings:
      How fair, how young, how soft soe'er he seem,
      Full from the fount of Joy's delicious springs
    Some bitter o'er the flowers its bubbling venom flings.

                            LXXXIII.

    Yet to the beauteous form he was not blind,
      Though now it moved him as it moves the wise;
      Not that Philosophy on such a mind
      E'er deigned to bend her chastely-awful eyes:
      But Passion raves herself to rest, or flies;
      And Vice, that digs her own voluptuous tomb,
      Had buried long his hopes, no more to rise:
      Pleasure's palled Victim! life-abhorring Gloom
    Wrote on his faded brow curst Cain's unresting doom.

                            LXXXIV.

    Still he beheld, nor mingled with the throng;
      But viewed them not with misanthropic hate:
      Fain would he now have joined the dance, the song;
      But who may smile that sinks beneath his fate?
      Nought that he saw his sadness could abate:
      Yet once he struggled 'gainst the Demon's sway,
      And as in Beauty's bower he pensive sate,
      Poured forth his unpremeditated lay,
    To charms as fair as those that soothed his happier day.

                               TO INEZ.

                               1.

    Nay, smile not at my sullen brow;
      Alas! I cannot smile again:
    Yet Heaven avert that ever thou
      Shouldst weep, and haply weep in vain.

                               2.

    And dost thou ask what secret woe
      I bear, corroding Joy and Youth?
    And wilt thou vainly seek to know
      A pang, ev'n thou must fail to soothe?

                               3.

    It is not love, it is not hate,
      Nor low Ambition's honours lost,
    That bids me loathe my present state,
      And fly from all I prized the most:

                               4.

    It is that weariness which springs
      From all I meet, or hear, or see:
    To me no pleasure Beauty brings;
      Thine eyes have scarce a charm for me.

                               5.

    It is that settled, ceaseless gloom
      The fabled Hebrew Wanderer bore;
    That will not look beyond the tomb,
      But cannot hope for rest before.

                               6.

    What Exile from himself can flee?
      To zones though more and more remote,
    Still, still pursues, where'er I be,
      The blight of Life--the Demon Thought.

                               7.

    Yet others rapt in pleasure seem,
      And taste of all that I forsake;
    Oh! may they still of transport dream,
      And ne'er--at least like me--awake!

                               8.

    Through many a clime 'tis mine to go,
      With many a retrospection curst;
    And all my solace is to know,
      Whate'er betides, I've known the worst.

                               9.

    What is that worst? Nay do not ask--
      In pity from the search forbear:
    Smile on--nor venture to unmask
      Man's heart, and view the Hell that's there.                           

                             LXXXV.

    Adieu, fair Cadiz! yea, a long adieu!
      Who may forget how well thy walls have stood?
      When all were changing thou alone wert true,
      First to be free and last to be subdued;
      And if amidst a scene, a shock so rude,
      Some native blood was seen thy streets to dye,
      A Traitor only fell beneath the feud: 
      Here all were noble, save Nobility;
    None hugged a Conqueror's chain, save fallen Chivalry!

                            LXXXVI.

    Such be the sons of Spain, and strange her Fate!
      They fight for Freedom who were never free,
      A Kingless people for a nerveless state;
      Her vassals combat when their Chieftains flee,
      True to the veriest slaves of Treachery:
      Fond of a land which gave them nought but life,
      Pride points the path that leads to Liberty;
      Back to the struggle, baffled in the strife,
    War, war is still the cry, "War even to the knife!"

                            LXXXVII.

    Ye, who would more of Spain and Spaniards know
      Go, read whate'er is writ of bloodiest strife:
      Whate'er keen Vengeance urged on foreign foe
      Can act, is acting there against man's life:
      From flashing scimitar to secret knife,
      War mouldeth there each weapon to his need--
      So may he guard the sister and the wife,
      So may he make each curst oppressor bleed--
    So may such foes deserve the most remorseless deed!

                         LXXXVIII.

    Flows there a tear of Pity for the dead?
      Look o'er the ravage of the reeking plain;
      Look on the hands with female slaughter red;
      Then to the dogs resign the unburied slain,
      Then to the vulture let each corse remain,
      Albeit unworthy of the prey-bird's maw;
      Let their bleached bones, and blood's unbleaching stain,
      Long mark the battle-field with hideous awe:
    Thus only may our sons conceive the scenes we saw!

                            LXXXIX.

    Nor yet, alas! the dreadful work is done;
      Fresh legions pour adown the Pyrenees:
      It deepens still, the work is scarce begun,
      Nor mortal eye the distant end foresees.
      Fall'n nations gaze on Spain; if freed, she frees
      More than her fell Pizarros once enchained:
      Strange retribution! now Columbia's ease
      Repairs the wrongs that Quito's sons sustained,
    While o'er the parent clime prowls Murder unrestrained.

                              XC.

    Not all the blood at Talavera shed,
      Not all the marvels of Barossa's fight,
      Not Albuera lavish of the dead,
      Have won for Spain her well asserted right.
      When shall her Olive-Branch be free from blight?
      When shall she breathe her from the blushing toil?
      How many a doubtful day shall sink in night,
      Ere the Frank robber turn him from his spoil,
    And Freedom's stranger-tree grow native of the soil!

                              XCI.

    And thou, my friend!--since unavailing woe
      Bursts from my heart, and mingles with the strain--
     Had the sword laid thee with the mighty low,
      Pride might forbid e'en Friendship to complain:
      But thus unlaurelled to descend in vain,
      By all forgotten, save the lonely breast,
      And mix unbleeding with the boasted slain,
      While Glory crowns so many a meaner crest!
    What hadst thou done to sink so peacefully to rest?

                             XCII.

    Oh, known the earliest, and esteemed the most!
      Dear to a heart where nought was left so dear!
      Though to my hopeless days for ever lost,
      In dreams deny me not to see thee here!
      And Morn in secret shall renew the tear
      Of Consciousness awaking to her woes,
      And Fancy hover o'er thy bloodless bier,
      Till my frail frame return to whence it rose,
    And mourned and mourner lie united in repose.

                             XCIII.

    Here is one fytte of Harold's pilgrimage:
      Ye who of him may further seek to know,
      Shall find some tidings in a future page,
      If he that rhymeth now may scribble moe.
      Is this too much? stern Critic! say not so:
      Patience! and ye shall hear what he beheld
      In other lands, where he was doomed to go:
      Lands that contain the monuments of Eld,
    Ere Greece and Grecian arts by barbarous hands were quelled.

                    CHILDE HAROLD'S PILGRIMAGE

                         CANTO THE SECOND.

                          Childe Harold
                             Canto 2.

                            I.

    Come, blue-eyed Maid of Heaven!--but Thou, alas!
      Didst never yet one mortal song inspire--
      Goddess of Wisdom! here thy temple was,
      And is, despite of War and wasting fire,
      And years, that bade thy worship to expire:
      But worse than steel, and flame, and ages slow,
      Is the dread sceptre and dominion dire
      Of men who never felt the sacred glow
    That thoughts of thee and thine on polished breasts bestow.

                              II.

    Ancient of days! august Athena! where,
      Where are thy men of might? thy grand in soul?
      Gone--glimmering through the dream of things that were:
      First in the race that led to Glory's goal,
      They won, and passed away--is this the whole?
      A schoolboy's tale, the wonder of an hour!
      The Warrior's weapon and the Sophist's stole
      Are sought in vain, and o'er each mouldering tower,
    Dim with the mist of years, gray flits the shade of power.

                              III.

    Son of the Morning, rise! approach you here!
      Come--but molest not yon defenceless Urn:
      Look on this spot--a Nation's sepulchre!
      Abode of Gods, whose shrines no longer burn.
      Even Gods must yield--Religions take their turn:
      'Twas Jove's--'tis Mahomet's--and other Creeds
      Will rise with other years, till Man shall learn
      Vainly his incense soars, his victim bleeds;
    Poor child of Doubt and Death, whose hope is built on reeds.

                              IV.

    Bound to the Earth, he lifts his eye to Heaven--
      Is't not enough, Unhappy Thing! to know
      Thou art? Is this a boon so kindly given,
      That being, thou would'st be again, and go,
      Thou know'st not, reck'st not to what region, so
      On Earth no more, but mingled with the skies?
      Still wilt thou dream on future Joy and Woe?
      Regard and weigh yon dust before it flies:
    That little urn saith more than thousand Homilies.

                               V.

    Or burst the vanished Hero's lofty mound;
      Far on the solitary shore he sleeps:
      He fell, and falling nations mourned around;
      But now not one of saddening thousands weeps,
      Nor warlike worshipper his vigil keeps
      Where demi-gods appeared, as records tell.
      Remove yon skull from out the scattered heaps:
      Is that a Temple where a God may dwell?
    Why ev'n the Worm at last disdains her shattered cell!

                              VI.

    Look on its broken arch, its ruined wall,
      Its chambers desolate, and portals foul:
      Yes, this was once Ambition's airy hall,
      The Dome of Thought, the Palace of the Soul:
      Behold through each lack-lustre, eyeless hole,
      The gay recess of Wisdom and of Wit
      And Passion's host, that never brooked control:
      Can all Saint, Sage, or Sophist ever writ,
    People this lonely tower, this tenement refit?

                              VII.

    Well didst thou speak, Athena's wisest son!
      "All that we know is, nothing can be known."
      Why should we shrink from what we cannot shun?
      Each hath its pang, but feeble sufferers groan
      With brain-born dreams of Evil all their own.
      Pursue what Chance or Fate proclaimeth best;
      Peace waits us on the shores of Acheron:
      There no forced banquet claims the sated guest,
    But Silence spreads the couch of ever welcome Rest.

                           VIII.

    Yet if, as holiest men have deemed, there be
      A land of Souls beyond that sable shore,
      To shame the Doctrine of the Sadducee
      And Sophists, madly vain of dubious lore;
      How sweet it were in concert to adore
      With those who made our mortal labours light!
      To hear each voice we feared to hear no more!
      Behold each mighty shade revealed to sight,
    The Bactrian, Samian sage, and all who taught the Right!

                            IX.

    There, Thou!--whose Love and Life together fled,
      Have left me here to love and live in vain--
      Twined with my heart, and can I deem thee dead
      When busy Memory flashes on my brain?
      Well--I will dream that we may meet again,
      And woo the vision to my vacant breast:
      If aught of young Remembrance then remain,
      Be as it may Futurity's behest,
    For me 'twere bliss enough to know thy spirit blest!

                               X.

    Here let me sit upon this massy stone,
      The marble column's yet unshaken base;
      Here, son of Saturn! was thy favourite throne:
      Mightiest of many such! Hence let me trace
      The latent grandeur of thy dwelling-place.
      It may not be: nor ev'n can Fancy's eye
      Restore what Time hath laboured to deface.
      Yet these proud Pillars claim no passing sigh;
    Unmoved the Moslem sits, the light Greek carols by.

                              XI.

    But who, of all the plunderers of yon Fane
      On high--where Pallas linger'd, loth to flee
      The latest relic of her ancient reign--
      The last, the worst, dull spoiler, who was he?
      Blush, Caledonia! such thy son could be!
      England! I joy no child he was of thine:
      Thy free-born men should spare what once was free;
      Yet they could violate each saddening shrine,
    And hear these altars o'er the long-reluctant brine.

                              XII.

    But most the modern Pict's ignoble boast,
      To rive what Goth, and Turk, and Time hath spared:
      Cold as the crags upon his native coast,
      His mind as barren and his heart as hard,
      Is he whose head conceived, whose hand prepared.
      Aught to displace Athenae's poor remains:
      Her Sons too weak the sacred shrine to guard,
      Yet felt some portion of their Mother's pains,
    And never knew, till then, the weight of Despot's chains.

                             XIII.

    What! shall it e'er be said by British tongue,
      Albion was happy in Athena's tears?
      Though in thy name the slaves her bosom wrung,
      Tell not the deed to blushing Europe's ears;
      The Ocean Queen, the free Britannia, bears
      The last poor plunder from a bleeding land:
      Yes, she, whose generous aid her name endears,
      Tore down those remnants with a Harpy's hand,
    Which envious Eld forbore, and tyrants left to stand.

                              XIV.

    Where was thine Aegis, Pallas! that appalled
      Stern Alaric and Havoc on their way?
      Where Peleus' son? whom Hell in vain enthralled.
      His shade from Hades upon that dread day
      Bursting to light in terrible array!
      What! could not Pluto spare the Chief once more,
      To scare a second robber from his prey?
      Idly he wandered on the Stygian shore,
    Nor now preserved the walls he loved to shield before.

                              XV.

    Cold is the heart, fair Greece! that looks on Thee,
      Nor feels as Lovers o'er the dust they loved;
      Dull is the eye that will not weep to see
      Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed
      By British hands, which it had best behoved
      To guard those relics ne'er to be restored:--
      Curst be the hour when from their isle they roved,
      And once again thy hapless bosom gored,
    And snatched thy shrinking Gods to Northern climes abhorred!

                              XVI.

    But where is Harold? shall I then forget
      To urge the gloomy Wanderer o'er the wave?
      Little recked he of all that Men regret;
      No loved-one now in feigned lament could rave;
      No friend the parting hand extended gave,
      Ere the cold Stranger passed to other climes:
      Hard is his heart whom charms may not enslave;
      But Harold felt not as in other times,
    And left without a sigh the land of War and Crimes.

                             XVII.

    He that has sailed upon the dark blue sea
      Has viewed at times, I ween, a full fair sight,
      When the fresh breeze is fair as breeze may be,
      The white sail set, the gallant Frigate tight--
      Masts, spires, and strand retiring to the right,
      The glorious Main expanding o'er the bow,
      The Convoy spread like wild swans in their flight,
      The dullest sailer wearing bravely now--
    So gaily curl the waves before each dashing prow.

                             XVIII.

    And oh, the little warlike world within!
      The well-reeved guns, the netted canopy,
      The hoarse command, the busy humming din,
      When, at a word, the tops are manned on high:
      Hark, to the Boatswain's call, the cheering cry!
      While through the seaman's hand the tackle glides;
      Or schoolboy Midshipman that, standing by,
      Strains his shrill pipe as good or ill betides,
    And well the docile crew that skilful Urchin guides.

                              XIX.

    White is the glassy deck, without a stain,
      Where on the watch the staid Lieutenant walks:
      Look on that part which sacred doth remain
      For the lone Chieftain, who majestic stalks,
      Silent and feared by all--not oft he talks
      With aught beneath him, if he would preserve
      That strict restraint, which broken, ever balks
      Conquest and Fame: but Britons rarely swerve
    From law, however stern, which tends their strength to nerve.

                              XX.

    Blow! swiftly blow, thou keel-compelling gale!
      Till the broad Sun withdraws his lessening ray:
      Then must the Pennant-bearer slacken sail,
      That lagging barks may make their lazy way.
      Ah! grievance sore, and listless dull delay,
      To waste on sluggish hulks the sweetest breeze!
      What leagues are lost, before the dawn of day,
      Thus loitering pensive on the willing seas,
    The flapping sail hauled down to halt for logs like these!

                              XXI.

    The Moon is up; by Heaven, a lovely eve!
      Long streams of light o'er dancing waves expand;
      Now lads on shore may sigh, and maids believe:
      Such be our fate when we return to land!
      Meantime some rude Arion's restless hand
      Wakes the brisk harmony that sailors love;
      A circle there of merry listeners stand
      Or to some well-known measure featly move,
    Thoughtless, as if on shore they still were free to rove.

                             XXII.

    Through Calpe's straits survey the steepy shore;
      Europe and Afric on each other gaze!
      Lands of the dark-eyed Maid and dusky Moor
      Alike beheld beneath pale Hecate's blaze:
      How softly on the Spanish shore she plays!
      Disclosing rock, and slope, and forest brown,
      Distinct, though darkening with her waning phase;
      But Mauritania's giant-shadows frown,
    From mountain-cliff to coast descending sombre down.

                             XXIII.

    'Tis night, when Meditation bids us feel
      We once have loved, though Love is at an end:
      The Heart, lone mourner of its baffled zeal,
      Though friendless now, will dream it had a friend.
      Who with the weight of years would wish to bend,
      When Youth itself survives young Love and Joy?
      Alas! when mingling souls forget to blend,
      Death hath but little left him to destroy!
    Ah! happy years! once more who would not be a boy?

                             XXIV.

    Thus bending o'er the vessel's laving side,
      To gaze on Dian's wave-reflected sphere,
      The Soul forgets her schemes of Hope and Pride,
      And flies unconscious o'er each backward year;
      None are so desolate but something dear,
      Dearer than self, possesses or possessed
      A thought, and claims the homage of a tear;
      A flashing pang! of which the weary breast
    Would still, albeit in vain, the heavy heart divest.

                             XXV.

    To sit on rocks--to muse o'er flood and fell--
      To slowly trace the forest's shady scene,
      Where things that own not Man's dominion dwell,
      And mortal foot hath ne'er or rarely been;
      To climb the trackless mountain all unseen,
      With the wild flock that never needs a fold;
      Alone o'er steeps and foaming falls to lean;
      This is not Solitude--'tis but to hold
    Converse with Nature's charms, and view her stores unrolled.

                             XXVI.

    But midst the crowd, the hum, the shock of men,
      To hear, to see, to feel, and to possess,
      And roam along, the World's tired denizen,
      With none who bless us, none whom we can bless;
      Minions of Splendour shrinking from distress!
      None that, with kindred consciousness endued,
      If we were not, would seem to smile the less,
      Of all that flattered--followed--sought, and sued:
    This is to be alone--This, This is Solitude!

                          XXVII.

    More blest the life of godly Eremite,
      Such as on lonely Athos may be seen,
      Watching at eve upon the Giant Height,
      Which looks o'er waves so blue, skies so serene,
      That he who there at such an hour hath been
      Will wistful linger on that hallowed spot;
      Then slowly tear him from the 'witching scene,
      Sigh forth one wish that such had been his lot,
    Then turn to hate a world he had almost forgot.

                            XXVIII.

    Pass we the long unvarying course, the track
      Oft trod, that never leaves a trace behind;
      Pass we the calm--the gale--the change--the tack,
      And each well known caprice of wave and wind;
      Pass we the joys and sorrows sailors find,
      Cooped in their winged sea-girt citadel;
      The foul--the fair--the contrary--the kind--
      As breezes rise and fall and billows swell,
    Till on some jocund morn--lo, Land! and All is well!

                             XXIX.

    But not in silence pass Calypso's isles,
      The sister tenants of the middle deep;
      There for the weary still a Haven smiles,
      Though the fair Goddess long hath ceased to weep,
      And o'er her cliffs a fruitless watch to keep
      For him who dared prefer a mortal bride:
      Here, too, his boy essayed the dreadful leap
      Stern Mentor urged from high to yonder tide;
    While thus of both bereft, the Nymph-Queen doubly sighed.

                              XXX.

    Her reign is past, her gentle glories gone:
      But trust not this; too easy Youth, beware!
      A mortal Sovereign holds her dangerous throne,
      And thou may'st find a new Calypso there.
      Sweet Florence could another ever share
      This wayward, loveless heart, it would be thine:
      But checked by every tie, I may not dare
      To cast a worthless offering at thy shrine,
    Nor ask so dear a breast to feel one pang for mine.

                             XXXI.

    Thus Harold deemed, as on that Lady's eye
      He looked, and met its beam without a thought,
      Save Admiration glancing harmless by:
      Love kept aloof, albeit not far remote,
      Who knew his Votary often lost and caught,
      But knew him as his Worshipper no more,
      And ne'er again the Boy his bosom sought:
      Since now he vainly urged him to adore,
    Well deemed the little God his ancient sway was o'er.

                             XXXII.

    Fair Florence found, in sooth with some amaze,
      One who, 'twas said, still sighed to all he saw,
      Withstand, unmoved, the lustre of her gaze,
      Which others hailed with real or mimic awe,
      Their hope, their doom, their punishment, their law;
      All that gay Beauty from her bondsmen claims:
      And much she marvelled that a youth so raw
      Nor felt, nor feigned at least, the oft-told flames,
    Which though sometimes they frown, yet rarely anger dames.

                            XXXIII.

    Little knew she that seeming marble heart,
      Now masked in silence or withheld by Pride,
      Was not unskilful in the spoiler's art,
      And spread its snares licentious far and wide;
      Nor from the base pursuit had turned aside,
      As long as aught was worthy to pursue:
      But Harold on such arts no more relied;
      And had he doted on those eyes so blue,
    Yet never would he join the lover's whining crew.

                             XXXIV.

    Not much he kens, I ween, of Woman's breast,
      Who thinks that wanton thing is won by sighs;
      What careth she for hearts when once possessed?
      Do proper homage to thine Idol's eyes;
      But not too humbly, or she will despise
      Thee and thy suit, though told in moving tropes:
      Disguise ev'n tenderness, if thou art wise;
      Brisk Confidence still best with woman copes:
    Pique her and soothe in turn--soon Passion crowns thy hopes.

                             XXXV.

    'Tis an old lesson--Time approves it true,
      And those who know it best, deplore it most;
      When all is won that all desire to woo,
      The paltry prize is hardly worth the cost:
      Youth wasted--Minds degraded--Honour lost--
      These are thy fruits, successful Passion! these!
      If, kindly cruel, early Hope is crost,
      Still to the last it rankles, a disease,
    Not to be cured when Love itself forgets to please.

                             XXXVI.

    Away! nor let me loiter in my song,
      For we have many a mountain-path to tread,
      And many a varied shore to sail along,
      By pensive Sadness, not by Fiction, led--
      Climes, fair withal as ever mortal head
      Imagined in its little schemes of thought;
      Or e'er in new Utopias were ared,
      To teach Man what he might be, or he ought--
    If that corrupted thing could ever such be taught.

                            XXXVII.

    Dear Nature is the kindest mother still!
      Though always changing, in her aspect mild;
      From her bare bosom let me take my fill,
      Her never-weaned, though not her favoured child.
      Oh! she is fairest in her features wild,
      Where nothing polished dares pollute her path:
      To me by day or night she ever smiled,
      Though I have marked her when none other hath,
    And sought her more and more, and loved her best in wrath.

                            XXXVIII.

    Land of Albania! where Iskander rose,
      Theme of the young, and beacon of the wise,
      And he his namesake, whose oft-baffled foes
      Shrunk from his deeds of chivalrous emprize:
      Land of Albania! let me bend mine eyes
      On thee, thou rugged Nurse of savage men!
      The Cross descends, thy Minarets arise,
      And the pale Crescent sparkles in the glen,
    Through many a cypress-grove within each city's ken.

                             XXXIX.

    Childe Harold sailed, and passed the barren spot,
      Where sad Penelope o'erlooked the wave;
      And onward viewed the mount, not yet forgot,
      The Lover's refuge, and the Lesbian's grave.
      Dark Sappho! could not Verse immortal save
      That breast imbued with such immortal fire?
      Could she not live who life eternal gave?
      If life eternal may await the lyre,
    That only Heaven to which Earth's children may aspire.

                              XL.

    'Twas on a Grecian autumn's gentle eve
      Childe Harold hailed Leucadia's cape afar;
      A spot he longed to see, nor cared to leave:
      Oft did he mark the scenes of vanished war,
      Actium--Lepanto--fatal Trafalgar;
      Mark them unmoved, for he would not delight
      (Born beneath some remote inglorious star)
      In themes of bloody fray, or gallant fight,
    But loathed the bravo's trade, and laughed at martial wight.

                              XLI.

    But when he saw the Evening star above
      Leucadia's far-projecting rock of woe,
      And hailed the last resort of fruitless love,
      He felt, or deemed he felt, no common glow:
      And as the stately vessel glided slow
      Beneath the shadow of that ancient mount,
      He watched the billows' melancholy flow,
      And, sunk albeit in thought as he was wont,
    More placid seemed his eye, and smooth his pallid front.

                             XLII.

    Morn dawns; and with it stern Albania's hills,
      Dark Suli's rocks, and Pindus' inland peak,
      Robed half in mist, bedewed with snowy rills,
      Arrayed in many a dun and purple streak,
      Arise; and, as the clouds along them break,
      Disclose the dwelling of the mountaineer:
      Here roams the wolf--the eagle whets his beak--
      Birds--beasts of prey--and wilder men appear,
    And gathering storms around convulse the closing year.

                             XLIII.

    Now Harold felt himself at length alone,
      And bade to Christian tongues a long adieu;
      Now he adventured on a shore unknown,
      Which all admire, but many dread to view:
      His breast was armed 'gainst fate, his wants were few
      Peril he sought not, but ne'er shrank to meet:
      The scene was savage, but the scene was new;
      This made the ceaseless toil of travel sweet,
    Beat back keen Winter's blast, and welcomed Summer's heat.

                             XLIV.

    Here the red Cross, for still the Cross is here,
      Though sadly scoffed at by the circumcised,
      Forgets that Pride to pampered priesthood dear;
      Churchman and Votary alike despised.
      Foul Superstition! howsoe'er disguised,
      Idol--Saint--Virgin--Prophet--Crescent--Cross--
      For whatsoever symbol thou art prized,
      Thou sacerdotal gain, but general loss!
    Who from true Worship's gold can separate thy dross?

                              XLV.

    Ambracia's gulf behold, where once was lost
      A world for Woman, lovely, harmless thing!
      In yonder rippling bay, their naval host
      Did many a Roman chief and Asian King
      To doubtful conflict, certain slaughter bring:
      Look where the second Caesar's trophies rose!
      Now, like the hands that reared them, withering:
      Imperial Anarchs, doubling human woes!
    GOD! was thy globe ordained for such to win and lose?

                             XLVI.

    From the dark barriers of that rugged clime,
      Ev'n to the centre of Illyria's vales,
      Childe Harold passed o'er many a mount sublime,
      Through lands scarce noticed in historic tales:
      Yet in famed Attica such lovely dales
      Are rarely seen; nor can fair Tempe boast
      A charm they know not; loved Parnassus fails,
      Though classic ground and consecrated most,
    To match some spots that lurk within this lowering coast.

                             XLVII.

    He passed bleak Pindus, Acherusia's lake,
      And left the primal city of the land,
      And onwards did his further journey take
      To greet Albania's Chief, whose dread command
      Is lawless law; for with a bloody hand
      He sways a nation,--turbulent and bold:
      Yet here and there some daring mountain-band
      Disdain his power, and from their rocky hold
    Hurl their defiance far, nor yield, unless to gold.

                            XLVIII.

    Monastic Zitza! from thy shady brow,
      Thou small, but favoured spot of holy ground!
      Where'er we gaze--around--above--below,--
      What rainbow tints, what magic charms are found!
      Rock, river, forest, mountain, all abound,
      And bluest skies that harmonise the whole:
      Beneath, the distant Torrent's rushing sound
      Tells where the volumed Cataract doth roll
    Between those hanging rocks, that shock yet please the soul.

                             XLIX.

    Amidst the grove that crowns yon tufted hill,
      Which, were it not for many a mountain nigh
      Rising in lofty ranks, and loftier still,
      Might well itself be deemed of dignity,
      The Convent's white walls glisten fair on high:
      Here dwells the caloyer, nor rude is he,
      Nor niggard of his cheer; the passer by
      Is welcome still; nor heedless will he flee
    From hence, if he delight kind Nature's sheen to see.

                               L.

    Here in the sultriest season let him rest,
      Fresh is the green beneath those aged trees;
      Here winds of gentlest wing will fan his breast,
      From Heaven itself he may inhale the breeze:
      The plain is far beneath--oh! let him seize
      Pure pleasure while he can; the scorching ray
      Here pierceth not, impregnate with disease:
      Then let his length the loitering pilgrim lay,
    And gaze, untired, the Morn--the Noon--the Eve away.

                              LI.

    Dusky and huge, enlarging on the sight,
      Nature's volcanic Amphitheatre,
      Chimaera's Alps extend from left to right:
      Beneath, a living valley seems to stir;
      Flocks play, trees wave, streams flow, the mountain-fir
      Nodding above; behold black Acheron!
      Once consecrated to the sepulchre.
      Pluto! if this be Hell I look upon,
    Close shamed Elysium's gates, my shade shall seek for none.

                              LII.

    Ne city's towers pollute the lovely view;
      Unseen is Yanina, though not remote,
      Veiled by the screen of hills: here men are few,
      Scanty the hamlet, rare the lonely cot:
      But, peering down each precipice, the goat
      Browseth; and, pensive o'er his scattered flock,
      The little shepherd in his white capote
      Doth lean his boyish form along the rock,
    Or in his cave awaits the Tempest's short-lived shock.

                             LIII.

    Oh! where, Dodona! is thine aged Grove,
      Prophetic Fount, and Oracle divine?
      What valley echoed the response of Jove?
      What trace remaineth of the Thunderer's shrine?
      All, all forgotten--and shall Man repine
      That his frail bonds to fleeting life are broke?
      Cease, Fool! the fate of Gods may well be thine:
      Wouldst thou survive the marble or the oak?
    When nations, tongues, and worlds must sink beneath the stroke!

                              LIV.

    Epirus' bounds recede, and mountains fail;
      Tired of up-gazing still, the wearied eye
      Reposes gladly on as smooth a vale
      As ever Spring yclad in grassy dye:
      Ev'n on a plain no humble beauties lie,
      Where some bold river breaks the long expanse,
      And woods along the banks are waving high,
      Whose shadows in the glassy waters dance,
    Or with the moonbeam sleep in Midnight's solemn trance.

                              LV.

    The Sun had sunk behind vast Tomerit,
      And Laos wide and fierce came roaring by;
      The shades of wonted night were gathering yet,
      When, down the steep banks winding warily,
      Childe Harold saw, like meteors in the sky,
      The glittering minarets of Tepalen,
      Whose walls o'erlook the stream; and drawing nigh,
      He heard the busy hum of warrior-men
    Swelling the breeze that sighed along the lengthening glen.

                              LVI.

    He passed the sacred Haram's silent tower,
      And underneath the wide o'erarching gate
      Surveyed the dwelling of this Chief of power,
      Where all around proclaimed his high estate.
      Amidst no common pomp the Despot sate,
      While busy preparation shook the court,
      Slaves, eunuchs, soldiers, guests, and santons wait;
      Within, a palace, and without, a fort:
    Here men of every clime appear to make resort.

                             LVII.

    Richly caparisoned, a ready row
      Of armed horse, and many a warlike store,
      Circled the wide-extending court below;
      Above, strange groups adorned the corridore;
      And oft-times through the area's echoing door
      Some high-capped Tartar spurred his steed away:
      The Turk--the Greek--the Albanian--and the Moor,
      Here mingled in their many-hued array,
    While the deep war-drum's sound announced the close of day.

                             LVIII.

    The wild Albanian kirtled to his knee,
      With shawl-girt head and ornamented gun,
      And gold-embroidered garments, fair to see;
      The crimson-scarfed men of Macedon;
      The Delhi with his cap of terror on,
      And crooked glaive--the lively, supple Greek
      And swarthy Nubia's mutilated son;
      The bearded Turk that rarely deigns to speak,
    Master of all around, too potent to be meek,

                              LIX.

    Are mixed conspicuous: some recline in groups,
      Scanning the motley scene that varies round;
      There some grave Moslem to devotion stoops,
      And some that smoke, and some that play, are found;
      Here the Albanian proudly treads the ground;
      Half-whispering there the Greek is heard to prate;
      Hark! from the Mosque the nightly solemn sound,
      The Muezzin's call doth shake the minaret,
    "There is no god but God!--to prayer--lo! God is great!"

                              LX.

    Just at this season Ramazani's fast
      Through the long day its penance did maintain:
      But when the lingering twilight hour was past,
      Revel and feast assumed the rule again:
      Now all was bustle, and the menial train
      Prepared and spread the plenteous board within;
      The vacant Gallery now seemed made in vain,
      But from the chambers came the mingling din,
    As page and slave anon were passing out and in.

                              LXI.

    Here woman's voice is never heard: apart,
      And scarce permitted, guarded, veiled, to move,
      She yields to one her person and her heart,
      Tamed to her cage, nor feels a wish to rove:
      For, not unhappy in her Master's love,
      And joyful in a mother's gentlest cares,
      Blest cares! all other feelings far above!
      Herself more sweetly rears the babe she bears
    Who never quits the breast--no meaner passion shares.

                             LXII.

    In marble-paved pavilion, where a spring
      Of living water from the centre rose,
      Whose bubbling did a genial freshness fling,
      And soft voluptuous couches breathed repose,
      ALI reclined, a man of war and woes:
      Yet in his lineaments ye cannot trace,
      While Gentleness her milder radiance throws
      Along that aged venerable face,
    The deeds that lurk beneath, and stain him with disgrace.

                             LXIII.

    It is not that yon hoary lengthening beard
      Ill suits the passions which belong to Youth;
      Love conquers Age--so Hafiz hath averr'd,
      So sings the Teian, and he sings in sooth--
      But crimes that scorn the tender voice of ruth,
      Beseeming all men ill, but most the man
      In years, have marked him with a tiger's tooth;
      Blood follows blood, and, through their mortal span,
    In bloodier acts conclude those who with blood began.

                             LXIV.

    'Mid many things most new to ear and eye
      The Pilgrim rested here his weary feet,
      And gazed around on Moslem luxury,
      Till quickly, wearied with that spacious seat
      Of Wealth and Wantonness, the choice retreat
      Of sated Grandeur from the city's noise:
      And were it humbler it in sooth were sweet;
      But Peace abhorreth artificial joys,
    And Pleasure, leagued with Pomp, the zest of both destroys.

                              LXV.

    Fierce are Albania's children, yet they lack
      Not virtues, were those virtues more mature.
      Where is the foe that ever saw their back?
      Who can so well the toil of War endure?
      Their native fastnesses not more secure
      Than they in doubtful time of troublous need:
      Their wrath how deadly! but their friendship sure,
      When Gratitude or Valour bids them bleed,
    Unshaken rushing on where'er their Chief may lead.

                             LXVI.

    Childe Harold saw them in their Chieftain's tower
      Thronging to War in splendour and success;
      And after viewed them, when, within their power,
      Himself awhile the victim of distress;
      That saddening hour when bad men hotlier press:
      But these did shelter him beneath their roof,
      When less barbarians would have cheered him less,
      And fellow-countrymen have stood aloof--
    In aught that tries the heart, how few withstand the proof!

                             LXVII.

    It chanced that adverse winds once drove his bark
      Full on the coast of Suli's shaggy shore,
      When all around was desolate and dark;
      To land was perilous, to sojourn more;
      Yet for awhile the mariners forbore,
      Dubious to trust where Treachery might lurk:
      At length they ventured forth, though doubting sore
      That those who loathe alike the Frank and Turk
    Might once again renew their ancient butcher-work.

                            LXVIII.

    Vain fear! the Suliotes stretched the welcome hand,
      Led them o'er rocks and past the dangerous swamp,
      Kinder than polished slaves though not so bland,
      And piled the hearth, and wrung their garments damp,
      And filled the bowl, and trimmed the cheerful lamp,
      And spread their fare; though homely, all they had:
      Such conduct bears Philanthropy's rare stamp:
      To rest the weary and to soothe the sad,
    Doth lesson happier men, and shames at least the bad.

                             LXIX.

    It came to pass, that when he did address
      Himself to quit at length this mountain-land,
      Combined marauders half-way barred egress,
      And wasted far and near with glaive and brand;
      And therefore did he take a trusty band
      To traverse Acarnania's forest wide,
      In war well-seasoned, and with labours tanned,
      Till he did greet white Achelous' tide,
    And from his further bank Aetolia's wolds espied.

                              LXX.

    Where lone Utraikey forms its circling cove,
      And weary waves retire to gleam at rest,
      How brown the foliage of the green hill's grove,
      Nodding at midnight o'er the calm bay's breast,
      As winds come lightly whispering from the West,
      Kissing, not ruffling, the blue deep's serene:--
      Here Harold was received a welcome guest;
      Nor did he pass unmoved the gentle scene,
    For many a joy could he from Night's soft presence glean.

                             LXXI.

    On the smooth shore the night-fires brightly blazed,
      The feast was done, the red wine circling fast,
      And he that unawares had there ygazed
      With gaping wonderment had stared aghast;
      For ere night's midmost, stillest hour was past,
      The native revels of the troop began;
      Each Palikar his sabre from him cast,
      And bounding hand in hand, man linked to man,
    Yelling their uncouth dirge, long daunced the kirtled clan.

                             LXXII.

    Childe Harold at a little distance stood
      And viewed, but not displeased, the revelrie,
      Nor hated harmless mirth, however rude:
      In sooth, it was no vulgar sight to see
      Their barbarous, yet their not indecent, glee;
      And, as the flames along their faces gleamed,
      Their gestures nimble, dark eyes flashing free,
      The long wild locks that to their girdles streamed,
    While thus in concert they this lay half sang,
                                               half screamed:--

                               1.

    Tambourgi! Tambourgi! thy 'larum afar
    Gives hope to the valiant, and promise of war;
    All the Sons of the mountains arise at the note,
    Chimariot, Illyrian, and dark Suliote!

                               2.

    Oh! who is more brave than a dark Suliote,
    In his snowy camese and his shaggy capote?
    To the wolf and the vulture he leaves his wild flock,
    And descends to the plain like the stream from the rock.

                               3.

    Shall the sons of Chimari, who never forgive
    The fault of a friend, bid an enemy live?
    Let those guns so unerring such vengeance forego?
    What mark is so fair as the breast of a foe?

                               4.

    Macedonia sends forth her invincible race;
    For a time they abandon the cave and the chase:
    But those scarfs of blood-red shall be redder, before
    The sabre is sheathed and the battle is o'er.

                               5.

    Then the Pirates of Parga that dwell by the waves,
    And teach the pale Franks what it is to be slaves,
    Shall leave on the beach the long galley and oar,
    And track to his covert the captive on shore.

                               6.

    I ask not the pleasures that riches supply,
    My sabre shall win what the feeble must buy;
    Shall win the young bride with her long flowing hair,
    And many a maid from her mother shall tear.

                               7.

    I love the fair face of the maid in her youth,
    Her caresses shall lull me, her music shall soothe;
    Let her bring from the chamber her many-toned lyre,
    And sing us a song on the fall of her Sire.

                               8.

    Remember the moment when Previsa fell,
    The shrieks of the conquered, the conquerors' yell;
    The roofs that we fired, and the plunder we shared,
    The wealthy we slaughtered, the lovely we spared.

                               9.

    I talk not of mercy, I talk not of fear;
    He neither must know who would serve the Vizier:
    Since the days of our Prophet the Crescent ne'er saw
    A chief ever glorious like Ali Pashaw.

                              10.

    Dark Muchtar his son to the Danube is sped,
    Let the yellow-haired Giaours
                                      view his horse-tail with dread;
    When his Delhis come dashing in blood o'er the banks,
    How few shall escape from the Muscovite ranks!

                              11.

    Selictar! unsheathe then our chief's Scimitar;
    Tambourgi! thy 'larum gives promise of War.
    Ye Mountains, that see us descend to the shore,
    Shall view us as Victors, or view us no more!

                            LXXIII.

    Fair Greece! sad relic of departed Worth!
      Immortal, though no more; though fallen, great!
      Who now shall lead thy scattered children forth,
      And long accustomed bondage uncreate?
      Not such thy sons who whilome did await,
      The helpless warriors of a willing doom,
      In bleak Thermopylae's sepulchral strait--
      Oh! who that gallant spirit shall resume,
    Leap from Eurotas' banks, and call thee from the tomb?

                             LXXIV.

    Spirit of Freedom! when on Phyle's brow
      Thou sat'st with Thrasybulus and his train,
      Couldst thou forebode the dismal hour which now
      Dims the green beauties of thine Attic plain?
      Not thirty tyrants now enforce the chain,
      But every carle can lord it o'er thy land;
      Nor rise thy sons, but idly rail in vain,
      Trembling beneath the scourge of Turkish hand,
    From birth till death enslaved; in word, in deed, unmanned.

                             LXXV.

    In all save form alone, how changed! and who
      That marks the fire still sparkling in each eye,
      Who but would deem their bosoms burned anew
      With thy unquenched beam, lost Liberty!
      And many dream withal the hour is nigh
      That gives them back their fathers' heritage:
      For foreign arms and aid they fondly sigh,
      Nor solely dare encounter hostile rage,
    Or tear their name defiled from Slavery's mournful page.

                             LXXVI.

    Hereditary Bondsmen! know ye not
      Who would be free themselves must strike the blow?
      By their right arms the conquest must be wrought?
      Will Gaul or Muscovite redress ye? No!
      True--they may lay your proud despoilers low,
      But not for you will Freedom's Altars flame.
      Shades of the Helots! triumph o'er your foe!
      Greece! change thy lords, thy state is still the same;
    Thy glorious day is o'er, but not thine years of shame.

                            LXXVII.

    The city won for Allah from the Giaour
      The Giaour from Othman's race again may wrest;
      And the Serai's impenetrable tower
      Receive the fiery Frank, her former guest;
      Or Wahab's rebel brood who dared divest
      The Prophet's tomb of all its pious spoil,
      May wind their path of blood along the West;
      But ne'er will Freedom seek this fated soil,
    But slave succeed to slave through years of endless toil.

                            LXXVIII.

    Yet mark their mirth--ere Lenten days begin,
      That penance which their holy rites prepare
      To shrive from Man his weight of mortal sin,
      By daily abstinence and nightly prayer;
      But ere his sackcloth garb Repentance wear,
      Some days of joyaunce are decreed to all,
      To take of pleasaunce each his secret share,
      In motley robe to dance at masking ball,
    And join the mimic train of merry Carnival.

                          LXXIX.

    And whose more rife with merriment than thine,
      Oh Stamboul! once the Empress of their reign?
      Though turbans now pollute Sophia's shrine,
      And Greece her very altars eyes in vain:
      (Alas! her woes will still pervade my strain!)
      Gay were her minstrels once, for free her throng,
      All felt the common joy they now must feign,
      Nor oft I've seen such sight, nor heard such song,
    As wooed the eye, and thrilled the Bosphorus along.

                             LXXX.

    Loud was the lightsome tumult on the shore,
      Oft Music changed, but never ceased her tone,
      And timely echoed back the measured oar,
      And rippling waters made a pleasant moan:
      The Queen of tides on high consenting shone,
      And when a transient breeze swept o'er the wave,
      'Twas, as if darting from her heavenly throne,
      A brighter glance her form reflected gave,
    Till sparkling billows seemed to light the banks they lave.

                             LXXXI.

    Glanced many a light Caique along the foam,
      Danced on the shore the daughters of the land,
      No thought had man or maid of rest or home,
      While many a languid eye and thrilling hand
      Exchanged the look few bosoms may withstand,
      Or gently prest, returned the pressure still:
      Oh Love! young Love! bound in thy rosy band,
      Let sage or cynic prattle as he will,
    These hours, and only these, redeem Life's years of ill!

                            LXXXII.

    But, midst the throng in merry masquerade,
      Lurk there no hearts that throb with secret pain,
      Even through the closest searment half betrayed?
      To such the gentle murmurs of the main
      Seem to re-echo all they mourn in vain;
      To such the gladness of the gamesome crowd
      Is source of wayward thought and stern disdain:
      How do they loathe the laughter idly loud,
    And long to change the robe of revel for the shroud!

                            LXXXIII.

    This must he feel, the true-born son of Greece,
      If Greece one true-born patriot still can boast:
      Not such as prate of War, but skulk in Peace,
      The bondsman's peace, who sighs for all he lost,
      Yet with smooth smile his Tyrant can accost,
      And wield the slavish sickle, not the sword:
      Ah! Greece! they love thee least who owe thee most--
      Their birth, their blood, and that sublime record
    Of hero Sires, who shame thy now degenerate horde!

                            LXXXIV.

    When riseth Lacedemon's Hardihood,
      When Thebes Epaminondas rears again,
      When Athens' children are with hearts endued,
      When Grecian mothers shall give birth to men,
      Then may'st thou be restored; but not till then.
      A thousand years scarce serve to form a state;
      An hour may lay it in the dust: and when
      Can Man its shattered splendour renovate,
    Recall its virtues back, and vanquish Time and Fate?

                             LXXXV.

    And yet how lovely in thine age of woe,
      Land of lost Gods and godlike men, art thou!
      Thy vales of evergreen, thy hills of snow,
      Proclaim thee Nature's varied favourite now:
      Thy fanes, thy temples to thy surface bow,
      Commingling slowly with heroic earth,
      Broke by the share of every rustic plough:
      So perish monuments of mortal birth,
    So perish all in turn, save well-recorded Worth:

                            LXXXVI.

    Save where some solitary column mourns
      Above its prostrate brethren of the cave;
      Save where Tritonia's airy shrine adorns
      Colonna's cliff, and gleams along the wave;
      Save o'er some warrior's half-forgotten grave,
      Where the gray stones and unmolested grass
      Ages, but not Oblivion, feebly brave;
      While strangers, only, not regardless pass,
    Lingering like me, perchance, to gaze, and sigh "Alas!"

                            LXXXVII.

    Yet are thy skies as blue, thy crags as wild;
      Sweet are thy groves, and verdant are thy fields,
      Thine olive ripe as when Minerva smiled,
      And still his honied wealth Hymettus yields;
      There the blithe Bee his fragrant fortress builds,
      The free-born wanderer of thy mountain-air;
      Apollo still thy long, long summer gilds,
      Still in his beam Mendeli's marbles glare:
    Art, Glory, Freedom fail, but Nature still is fair.

                         LXXXVIII.

    Where'er we tread 'tis haunted, holy ground;
      No earth of thine is lost in vulgar mould,
      But one vast realm of Wonder spreads around,
      And all the Muse's tales seem truly told,
      Till the sense aches with gazing to behold
      The scenes our earliest dreams have dwelt upon;
      Each hill and dale, each deepening glen and wold
      Defies the power which crushed thy temples gone:
    Age shakes Athenae's tower, but spares gray Marathon.

                            LXXXIX.

    The Sun, the soil--but not the slave, the same;--
      Unchanged in all except its foreign Lord,
      Preserves alike its bounds and boundless fame
      The Battle-field, where Persia's victim horde
      First bowed beneath the brunt of Hellas' sword,
      As on the morn to distant Glory dear,
      When Marathon became a magic word;
      Which uttered, to the hearer's eye appear
    The camp, the host, the fight, the Conqueror's career,

                              XC.

    The flying Mede, his shaftless broken bow--
      The fiery Greek, his red pursuing spear;
      Mountains above--Earth's, Ocean's plain below--
      Death in the front, Destruction in the rear!
      Such was the scene--what now remaineth here?
      What sacred Trophy marks the hallowed ground,
      Recording Freedom's smile and Asia's tear?
      The rifled urn, the violated mound,
    The dust thy courser's hoof, rude stranger! spurns around.

                              XCI.

    Yet to the remnants of thy Splendour past
      Shall pilgrims, pensive, but unwearied, throng;
      Long shall the voyager, with th' Ionian blast,
      Hail the bright clime of Battle and of Song:
      Long shall thine annals and immortal tongue
      Fill with thy fame the youth of many a shore;
      Boast of the aged! lesson of the young!
      Which Sages venerate and Bards adore,
    As Pallas and the Muse unveil their awful lore.

                             XCII.

    The parted bosom clings to wonted home,
      If aught that's kindred cheer the welcome hearth;
      He that is lonely--hither let him roam,
      And gaze complacent on congenial earth.
      Greece is no lightsome land of social mirth:
      But he whom Sadness sootheth may abide,
      And scarce regret the region of his birth,
      When wandering slow by Delphi's sacred side,
    Or gazing o'er the plains where Greek and Persian died.

                             XCIII.

    Let such approach this consecrated Land,
      And pass in peace along the magic waste;
      But spare its relics--let no busy hand
      Deface the scenes, already how defaced!
      Not for such purpose were these altars placed:
      Revere the remnants Nations once revered:
      So may our Country's name be undisgraced,
      So may'st thou prosper where thy youth was reared,
    By every honest joy of Love and Life endeared!

                             XCIV.

    For thee, who thus in too protracted song
      Hast soothed thine Idlesse with inglorious lays,
      Soon shall thy voice be lost amid the throng
      Of louder Minstrels in these later days:
      To such resign the strife for fading Bays--
      Ill may such contest now the spirit move
      Which heeds nor keen Reproach nor partial Praise,
      Since cold each kinder heart that might approve--
    And none are left to please when none are left to love.

                              XCV.

    Thou too art gone, thou loved and lovely one!
      Whom Youth and Youth's affections bound to me;
      Who did for me what none beside have done,
      Nor shrank from one albeit unworthy thee.
      What is my Being! thou hast ceased to be!
      Nor staid to welcome here thy wanderer home,
      Who mourns o'er hours which we no more shall see--
      Would they had never been, or were to come!
    Would he had ne'er returned to find fresh cause to roam!

                             XCVI.

    Oh! ever loving, lovely, and beloved!
      How selfish Sorrow ponders on the past,
      And clings to thoughts now better far removed!
      But Time shall tear thy shadow from me last.
      All thou couldst have of mine, stern Death! thou hast;
      The Parent, Friend, and now the more than Friend:
      Ne'er yet for one thine arrows flew so fast,
      And grief with grief continuing still to blend,
    Hath snatched the little joy that Life had yet to lend.

                             XCVII.

    Then must I plunge again into the crowd,
      And follow all that Peace disdains to seek?
      Where Revel calls, and Laughter, vainly loud,
      False to the heart, distorts the hollow cheek,
      To leave the flagging spirit doubly weak;
      Still o'er the features, which perforce they cheer,
      To feign the pleasure or conceal the pique:
      Smiles form the channel of a future tear,
    Or raise the writhing lip with ill-dissembled sneer.

                            XCVIII.

    What is the worst of woes that wait on Age?
      What stamps the wrinkle deeper on the brow?
      To view each loved one blotted from Life's page,
      And be alone on earth, as I am now.
      Before the Chastener humbly let me bow,
      O'er Hearts divided and o'er Hopes destroyed:
      Roll on, vain days! full reckless may ye flow,
      Since Time hath reft whate'er my soul enjoyed,
    And with the ills of Eld mine earlier years alloyed.
 
                        CHILDE HAROLD'S PILGRIMAGE.
  
                             CANTO THE THIRD.

                               I.

    Is thy face like thy mothers, my fair child!
      ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?
      When last I saw thy young blue eyes they smiled,
      And then we parted,--not as now we part,
      But with a hope.--
                         Awaking with a start,
      The waters heave around me; and on high
      The winds lift up their voices: I depart,
      Whither I know not; but the hour's gone by,
    When Albion's lessening shores could grieve or glad mine eye.

                              II.

    Once more upon the waters! yet once more!
      And the waves bound beneath me as a steed
      That knows his rider. Welcome to their roar!
      Swift be their guidance, wheresoe'er it lead!
      Though the strained mast should quiver as a reed,
      And the rent canvass fluttering strew the gale,
      Still must I on; for I am as a weed,
      Flung from the rock, on Ocean's foam, to sail
    Where'er the surge may sweep, the tempest's breath prevail.

                              III.

    In my youth's summer I did sing of One,
      The wandering outlaw of his own dark mind;
      Again I seize the theme, then but begun,
      And bear it with me, as the rushing wind
      Bears the cloud onwards: in that Tale I find
      The furrows of long thought, and dried-up tears,
      Which, ebbing, leave a sterile track behind,
      O'er which all heavily the journeying years
    Plod the last sands of life,--where not a flower appears.

                              IV.

    Since my young days of passion--joy, or pain--
      Perchance my heart and harp have lost a string--
      And both may jar: it may be, that in vain
      I would essay as I have sung to sing:
      Yet, though a dreary strain, to this I cling;
      So that it wean me from the weary dream
      Of selfish grief or gladness--so it fling
      Forgetfulness around me--it shall seem
    To me, though to none else, a not ungrateful theme.

                               V.

    He, who grown aged in this world of woe,
      In deeds, not years, piercing the depths of life,
      So that no wonder waits him--nor below
      Can Love or Sorrow, Fame, Ambition, Strife,
      Cut to his heart again with the keen knife
      Of silent, sharp endurance--he can tell
      Why Thought seeks refuge in lone caves, yet rife
      With airy images, and shapes which dwell
    Still unimpaired, though old, in the Soul's haunted cell.

                              VI.

    'Tis to create, and in creating live
      A being more intense that we endow
      With form our fancy, gaining as we give
      The life we image, even as I do now--
      What am I? Nothing: but not so art thou,
      Soul of my thought! with whom I traverse earth,
      Invisible but gazing, as I glow--
      Mixed with thy spirit, blended with thy birth,
    And feeling still with thee in my crushed feelings' dearth.

                              VII.

    Yet must I think less wildly:--I have thought
      Too long and darkly, till my brain became,
      In its own eddy boiling and o'erwrought,
      A whirling gulf of phantasy and flame:
      And thus, untaught in youth my heart to tame,
      My springs of life were poisoned. 'Tis too late:
      Yet am I changed; though still enough the same
      In strength to bear what Time can not abate,
    And feed on bitter fruits without accusing Fate.

                             VIII.

    Something too much of this:--but now 'tis past,
      And the spell closes with its silent seal--
      Long absent HAROLD re-appears at last;
      He of the breast which fain no more would feel,
      Wrung with the wounds which kill not, but ne'er heal;
      Yet Time, who changes all, had altered him
      In soul and aspect as in age: years steal
      Fire from the mind as vigour from the limb;
    And Life's enchanted cup but sparkles near the brim.

                              IX.

    His had been quaffed too quickly, and he found
      The dregs were wormwood; but he filled again,
      And from a purer fount, on holier ground,
      And deemed its spring perpetual--but in vain!
      Still round him clung invisibly a chain
      Which galled for ever, fettering though unseen,
      And heavy though it clanked not; worn with pain,
      Which pined although it spoke not, and grew keen,
    Entering with every step he took through many a scene.

                               X.

    Secure in guarded coldness, he had mixed
      Again in fancied safety with his kind,
      And deemed his spirit now so firmly fixed
      And sheathed with an invulnerable mind,
      That, if no joy, no sorrow lurked behind;
      And he, as one, might 'midst the many stand
      Unheeded, searching through the crowd to find
      Fit speculation--such as in strange land
    He found in wonder-works of God and Nature's hand.

                              XI.

    But who can view the ripened rose, nor seek
      To wear it? who can curiously behold
      The smoothness and the sheen of Beauty's cheek,
      Nor feel the heart can never all grow old?
      Who can contemplate Fame through clouds unfold
      The star which rises o'er her steep, nor climb?
      Harold, once more within the vortex, rolled
      On with the giddy circle, chasing Time,
    Yet with a nobler aim than in his Youth's fond prime.

                              XII.

    But soon he knew himself the most unfit
      Of men to herd with Man, with whom he held
      Little in common; untaught to submit
      His thoughts to others, though his soul was quelled
      In youth by his own thoughts; still uncompelled,
      He would not yield dominion of his mind
      To Spirits against whom his own rebelled,
      Proud though in desolation--which could find
    A life within itself, to breathe without mankind.

                             XIII.

    Where rose the mountains, there to him were friends;
      Where rolled the ocean, thereon was his home;
      Where a blue sky, and glowing clime, extends,
      He had the passion and the power to roam;
      The desert, forest, cavern, breaker's foam,
      Were unto him companionship; they spake
      A mutual language, clearer than the tome
      Of his land's tongue, which he would oft forsake
    For Nature's pages glassed by sunbeams on the lake.

                              XIV.

    Like the Chaldean, he could watch the stars,
      Till he had peopled them with beings bright
      As their own beams; and earth, and earth-born jars,
      And human frailties, were forgotten quite:
      Could he have kept his spirit to that flight
      He had been happy; but this clay will sink
      Its spark immortal, envying it the light
      To which it mounts, as if to break the link
    That keeps us from yon heaven which woos us to its brink.

                              XV.

    But in Man's dwellings he became a thing
      Restless and worn, and stern and wearisome,
      Drooped as a wild-born falcon with clipt wing,
      To whom the boundless air alone were home:
      Then came his fit again, which to o'ercome,
      As eagerly the barred-up bird will beat
      His breast and beak against his wiry dome
      Till the blood tinge his plumage--so the heat
    Of his impeded Soul would through his bosom eat.

                              XVI.

    Self-exiled Harold wanders forth again,
      With nought of Hope left--but with less of gloom;
      The very knowledge that he lived in vain,
      That all was over on this side the tomb,
      Had made Despair a smilingness assume,
      Which, though 'twere wild,--as on the plundered wreck
      When mariners would madly meet their doom
      With draughts intemperate on the sinking deck,--
    Did yet inspire a cheer, which he forbore to check.

                             XVII.

    Stop!--for thy tread is on an Empire's dust!
      An Earthquake's spoil is sepulchred below!
      Is the spot marked with no colossal bust?
      Nor column trophied for triumphal show?
      None; but the moral's truth tells simpler so.--
      As the ground was before, thus let it be;--
      How that red rain hath made the harvest grow!
      And is this all the world has gained by thee,
    Thou first and last of Fields! king-making Victory?

                             XVIII.

    And Harold stands upon this place of skulls,
      The grave of France, the deadly Waterloo!
      How in an hour the Power which gave annuls
      Its gifts, transferring fame as fleeting too!--
      In "pride of place" here last the Eagle flew,
      Then tore with bloody talon the rent plain,
      Pierced by the shaft of banded nations through;
      Ambition's life and labours all were vain--
    He wears the shattered links of the World's broken chain.

                              XIX.

    Fit retribution! Gaul may champ the bit
      And foam in fetters;--but is Earth more free?
      Did nations combat to make One submit?
      Or league to teach all Kings true Sovereignty?
      What! shall reviving Thraldom again be
      The patched-up Idol of enlightened days?
      Shall we, who struck the Lion down, shall we
      Pay the Wolf homage? proffering lowly gaze
    And servile knees to Thrones? No! prove before ye praise!

                              XX.

    If not, o'er one fallen Despot boast no more!
      In vain fair cheeks were furrowed with hot tears
      For Europe's flowers long rooted up before
      The trampler of her vineyards; in vain, years
      Of death, depopulation, bondage, fears,
      Have all been borne, and broken by the accord
      Of roused-up millions: all that most endears
      Glory, is when the myrtle wreathes a Sword,
    Such as Harmodius drew on Athens' tyrant Lord.

                              XXI.

    There was a sound of revelry by night,
      And Belgium's Capital had gathered then
      Her Beauty and her Chivalry--and bright
      The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;
      A thousand hearts beat happily; and when
      Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
      Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,
      And all went merry as a marriage bell;
    But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!

                             XXII.

    Did ye not hear it?--No--'twas but the Wind,
      Or the car rattling o'er the stony street;
      On with the dance! let joy be unconfined;
      No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet
      To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet--
      But hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more,
      As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
      And nearer--clearer--deadlier than before!
    Arm! Arm! it is--it is--the cannon's opening roar!

                             XXIII.

    Within a windowed niche of that high hall
      Sate Brunswick's fated Chieftain; he did hear
      That sound the first amidst the festival,
      And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;
      And when they smiled because he deemed it near,
      His heart more truly knew that peal too well
      Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,
      And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell;
    He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.

                             XXIV.

    Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro--
      And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,
      And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago
      Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness--
      And there were sudden partings, such as press
      The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
      Which ne'er might be repeated; who could guess
      If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
    Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise!

                              XXV.

    And there was mounting in hot haste--the steed,
      The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,
      Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
      And swiftly forming in the ranks of war--
      And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;
      And near, the beat of the alarming drum
      Roused up the soldier ere the Morning Star;
      While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,
    Or whispering, with white lips--"The foe! They come! they come!"

                             XXVI.

    And wild and high the "Cameron's Gathering" rose!
      The war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn's hills
      Have heard, and heard, too, have her Saxon foes;--
      How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills,
      Savage and shrill! But with the breath which fills
      Their mountain-pipe, so fill the mountaineers
      With the fierce native daring which instils
      The stirring memory of a thousand years,
    And Evan's--Donald's fame rings in each clansman's ears!

                             XXVII.

    And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,
      Dewy with Nature's tear-drops, as they pass--
      Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,
      Over the unreturning brave,--alas!
      Ere evening to be trodden like the grass
      Which now beneath them, but above shall grow
      In its next verdure, when this fiery mass
      Of living Valour, rolling on the foe
    And burning with high Hope, shall moulder cold and low.

                            XXVIII.

    Last noon beheld them full of lusty life;--
      Last eve in Beauty's circle proudly gay;
      The Midnight brought the signal-sound of strife,
      The Morn the marshalling in arms,--the Day
      Battle's magnificently-stern array!
      The thunder-clouds close o'er it, which when rent
      The earth is covered thick with other clay
      Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,
    Rider and horse,--friend,--foe,--in one red burial blent!

                             XXIX.

    Their praise is hymned by loftier harps than mine;
      Yet one I would select from that proud throng,
      Partly because they blend me with his line,
      And partly that I did his Sire some wrong,
      And partly that bright names will hallow song;
      And his was of the bravest, and when showered
      The death-bolts deadliest the thinned files along,
      Even where the thickest of War's tempest lowered,
    They reached no nobler breast than thine, young, gallant Howard!

                              XXX.

    There have been tears and breaking hearts for thee,
      And mine were nothing, had I such to give;
      But when I stood beneath the fresh green tree,
      Which living waves where thou didst cease to live,
      And saw around me the wide field revive
      With fruits and fertile promise, and the Spring
      Come forth her work of gladness to contrive,
      With all her reckless birds upon the wing,
    I turned from all she brought to those she could not bring.

                             XXXI.

    I turned to thee, to thousands, of whom each
      And one as all a ghastly gap did make
      In his own kind and kindred, whom to teach
      Forgetfulness were mercy for their sake;
      The Archangel's trump, not Glory's, must awake
      Those whom they thirst for; though the sound of Fame
      May for a moment soothe, it cannot slake
      The fever of vain longing, and the name
    So honoured but assumes a stronger, bitterer claim.

                             XXXII.

    They mourn, but smile at length--and, smiling, mourn:
      The tree will wither long before it fall;
      The hull drives on, though mast and sail be torn;
      The roof-tree sinks, but moulders on the hall
      In massy hoariness; the ruined wall
      Stands when its wind-worn battlements are gone;
      The bars survive the captive they enthral;
      The day drags through though storms keep out the sun;
    And thus the heart will break, yet brokenly live on:

                            XXXIII.

    Even as a broken Mirror, which the glass
      In every fragment multiplies--and makes
      A thousand images of one that was,
      The same--and still the more, the more it breaks;
      And thus the heart will do which not forsakes,
      Living in shattered guise; and still, and cold,
      And bloodless, with its sleepless sorrow aches,
      Yet withers on till all without is old,
    Showing no visible sign, for such things are untold.

                             XXXIV.

    There is a very life in our despair,
      Vitality of poison,--a quick root
      Which feeds these deadly branches; for it were
      As nothing did we die; but Life will suit
      Itself to Sorrow's most detested fruit,
      Like to the apples on the Dead Sea's shore,
      All ashes to the taste: Did man compute
      Existence by enjoyment, and count o'er
    Such hours 'gainst years of life,--say, would he name threescore?

                             XXXV.

    The Psalmist numbered out the years of man:
      They are enough; and if thy tale be true,
      Thou, who didst grudge him even that fleeting span,
      More than enough, thou fatal Waterloo!
      Millions of tongues record thee, and anew
      Their children's lips shall echo them, and say--
      "Here, where the sword united nations drew,
      Our countrymen were warring on that day!"
    And this is much--and all--which will not pass away.

                             XXXVI.

    There sunk the greatest, nor the worst of men,
      Whose Spirit, antithetically mixed,
      One moment of the mightiest, and again
      On little objects with like firmness fixed;
      Extreme in all things! hadst thou been betwixt,
      Thy throne had still been thine, or never been;
      For Daring made thy rise as fall: thou seek'st
      Even now to re-assume the imperial mien,
    And shake again the world, the Thunderer of the scene!

                            XXXVII.

    Conqueror and Captive of the Earth art thou!
      She trembles at thee still, and thy wild name
      Was ne'er more bruited in men's minds than now
      That thou art nothing, save the jest of Fame,
      Who wooed thee once, thy Vassal, and became
      The flatterer of thy fierceness--till thou wert
      A God unto thyself; nor less the same
      To the astounded kingdoms all inert,
    Who deemed thee for a time whate'er thou didst assert.

                            XXXVIII.

    Oh, more or less than man--in high or low--
      Battling with nations, flying from the field;
      Now making monarchs' necks thy footstool, now
      More than thy meanest soldier taught to yield;
      An Empire thou couldst crush, command, rebuild,
      But govern not thy pettiest passion, nor,
      However deeply in men's spirits skilled,
      Look through thine own, nor curb the lust of War,
    Nor learn that tempted Fate will leave the loftiest Star.

                             XXXIX.

    Yet well thy soul hath brooked the turning tide
      With that untaught innate philosophy,
      Which, be it Wisdom, Coldness, or deep Pride,
      Is gall and wormwood to an enemy.
      When the whole host of hatred stood hard by,
      To watch and mock thee shrinking, thou hast smiled
      With a sedate and all-enduring eye;--
      When Fortune fled her spoiled and favourite child,
    He stood unbowed beneath the ills upon him piled.

                              XL.

    Sager than in thy fortunes; for in them
      Ambition steeled thee on too far to show
      That just habitual scorn, which could contemn
      Men and their thoughts; 'twas wise to feel, not so
      To wear it ever on thy lip and brow,
      And spurn the instruments thou wert to use
      Till they were turned unto thine overthrow:
      'Tis but a worthless world to win or lose;
    So hath it proved to thee, and all such lot who choose.

                              XLI.

    If, like a tower upon a headlong rock,
      Thou hadst been made to stand or fall alone,
      Such scorn of man had helped to brave the shock;
      But men's thoughts were the steps which paved thy throne,
      Their admiration thy best weapon shone;
      The part of Philip's son was thine, not then
      (Unless aside thy Purple had been thrown)
      Like stern Diogenes to mock at men--
    For sceptred Cynics Earth were far too wide a den.

                             XLII.

    But Quiet to quick bosoms is a Hell,
      And there hath been thy bane; there is a fire
      And motion of the Soul which will not dwell
      In its own narrow being, but aspire
      Beyond the fitting medium of desire;
      And, but once kindled, quenchless evermore,
      Preys upon high adventure, nor can tire
      Of aught but rest; a fever at the core,
    Fatal to him who bears, to all who ever bore.

                             XLIII.

    This makes the madmen who have made men mad
      By their contagion; Conquerors and Kings,
      Founders of sects and systems, to whom add
      Sophists, Bards, Statesmen, all unquiet things
      Which stir too strongly the soul's secret springs,
      And are themselves the fools to those they fool;
      Envied, yet how unenviable! what stings
      Are theirs! One breast laid open were a school
    Which would unteach Mankind the lust to shine or rule:

                             XLIV.

    Their breath is agitation, and their life
      A storm whereon they ride, to sink at last,
      And yet so nursed and bigoted to strife,
      That should their days, surviving perils past,
      Melt to calm twilight, they feel overcast
      With sorrow and supineness, and so die;
      Even as a flame unfed, which runs to waste
      With its own flickering, or a sword laid by,
    Which eats into itself, and rusts ingloriously.

                              XLV.

    He who ascends to mountain-tops, shall find
      The loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow;
      He who surpasses or subdues mankind,
      Must look down on the hate of those below.
      Though high above the Sun of Glory glow,
      And far beneath the Earth and Ocean spread,
      Round him are icy rocks, and loudly blow
      Contending tempests on his naked head,
    And thus reward the toils which to those summits led.

                             XLVI.

    Away with these! true Wisdom's world will be
      Within its own creation, or in thine,
      Maternal Nature! for who teems like thee,
      Thus on the banks of thy majestic Rhine?
      There Harold gazes on a work divine,
      A blending of all beauties; streams and dells,
      Fruit, foliage, crag, wood, cornfield, mountain, vine,
      And chiefless castles breathing stern farewells
    From gray but leafy walls, where Ruin greenly dwells.

                             XLVII.

    And there they stand, as stands a lofty mind,
      Worn, but unstooping to the baser crowd,
      All tenantless, save to the crannying Wind,
      Or holding dark communion with the Cloud
      There was a day when they were young and proud;
      Banners on high, and battles passed below;
      But they who fought are in a bloody shroud,
      And those which waved are shredless dust ere now,
    And the bleak battlements shall bear no future blow.

                            XLVIII.

    Beneath these battlements, within those walls,
      Power dwelt amidst her passions; in proud state
      Each robber chief upheld his armed halls,
      Doing his evil will, nor less elate
      Than mightier heroes of a longer date.
      What want these outlaws conquerors should have
      But History's purchased page to call them great?
      A wider space--an ornamented grave?
    Their hopes were not less warm, their souls were full as brave.

                             XLIX.

    In their baronial feuds and single fields,
      What deeds of prowess unrecorded died!
      And Love, which lent a blazon to their shields,
      With emblems well devised by amorous pride,
      Through all the mail of iron hearts would glide;
      But still their flame was fierceness, and drew on
      Keen contest and destruction near allied,
      And many a tower for some fair mischief won,
    Saw the discoloured Rhine beneath its ruin run.

                               L.

    But Thou, exulting and abounding river!
      Making thy waves a blessing as they flow
      Through banks whose beauty would endure for ever
      Could man but leave thy bright creation so,
      Nor its fair promise from the surface mow
      With the sharp scythe of conflict, then to see
      Thy valley of sweet waters, were to know
      Earth paved like Heaven--and to seem such to me,
    Even now what wants thy stream?--that it should Lethe be.

                              LI.

    A thousand battles have assailed thy banks,
      But these and half their fame have passed away,
      And Slaughter heaped on high his weltering ranks:
      Their very graves are gone, and what are they?
      Thy tide washed down the blood of yesterday,
      And all was stainless, and on thy clear stream
      Glassed, with its dancing light, the sunny ray;
      But o'er the blacken'd memory's blighting dream
    Thy waves would vainly roll, all sweeping as they seem.

                              LII.

    Thus Harold inly said, and passed along,
      Yet not insensible to all which here
      Awoke the jocund birds to early song
      In glens which might have made even exile dear:
      Though on his brow were graven lines austere,
      And tranquil sternness, which had ta'en the place
      Of feelings fierier far but less severe--
      Joy was not always absent from his face,
    But o'er it in such scenes would steal with transient trace.

                             LIII.

    Nor was all Love shut from him, though his days
      Of Passion had consumed themselves to dust.
      It is in vain that we would coldly gaze
      On such as smile upon us; the heart must
      Leap kindly back to kindness, though Disgust
      Hath weaned it from all worldlings: thus he felt,
      For there was soft Remembrance, and sweet Trust
      In one fond breast, to which his own would melt,
    And in its tenderer hour on that his bosom dwelt.

                              LIV.

    And he had learned to love,--I know not why,
      For this in such as him seems strange of mood,
      The helpless looks of blooming Infancy,
      Even in its earliest nurture; what subdued,
      To change like this, a mind so far imbued
      With scorn of man, it little boots to know;
      But thus it was; and though in solitude
      Small power the nipped affections have to grow,
    In him this glowed when all beside had ceased to glow.

                              LV.

    And there was one soft breast, as hath been said,
      Which unto his was bound by stronger ties
      Than the church links withal; and--though unwed,
      That love was pure--and, far above disguise,
      Had stood the test of mortal enmities
      Still undivided, and cemented more
      By peril, dreaded most in female eyes;
      But this was firm, and from a foreign shore
    Well to that heart might his these absent greetings pour!

                               1.

    The castled Crag of Drachenfels
    Frowns o'er the wide and winding Rhine,
    Whose breast of waters broadly swells
    Between the banks which bear the vine,
    And hills all rich with blossomed trees,
    And fields which promise corn and wine,
    And scattered cities crowning these,
    Whose far white walls along them shine,
    Have strewed a scene, which I should see
    With double joy wert thou with me.

                               2.

    And peasant girls, with deep blue eyes,
    And hands which offer early flowers,
    Walk smiling o'er this Paradise;
    Above, the frequent feudal towers
    Through green leaves lift their walls of gray;
    And many a rock which steeply lowers,
    And noble arch in proud decay,
    Look o'er this vale of vintage-bowers;
    But one thing want these banks of Rhine,--
    Thy gentle hand to clasp in mine!

                               3.

    I send the lilies given to me--
    Though long before thy hand they touch,
    I know that they must withered be,
    But yet reject them not as such;
    For I have cherished them as dear,
    Because they yet may meet thine eye,
    And guide thy soul to mine even here,
    When thou behold'st them drooping nigh,
    And know'st them gathered by the Rhine,
    And offered from my heart to thine!

                               4.

    The river nobly foams and flows--
    The charm of this enchanted ground,
    And all its thousand turns disclose
    Some fresher beauty varying round:
    The haughtiest breast its wish might bound
    Through life to dwell delighted here;
    Nor could on earth a spot be found
    To Nature and to me so dear--
    Could thy dear eyes in following mine
    Still sweeten more these banks of Rhine!

                              LVI.

    By Coblentz, on a rise of gentle ground,
      There is a small and simple Pyramid,
      Crowning the summit of the verdant mound;
      Beneath its base are Heroes' ashes hid--
      Our enemy's--but let not that forbid
      Honour to Marceau! o'er whose early tomb
      Tears, big tears, gushed from the rough soldier's lid,
      Lamenting and yet envying such a doom,
    Falling for France, whose rights he battled to resume.

                             LVII.

    Brief, brave, and glorious was his young career,--
      His mourners were two hosts, his friends and foes;
      And fitly may the stranger lingering here
      Pray for his gallant Spirit's bright repose;--
      For he was Freedom's Champion, one of those,
      The few in number, who had not o'erstept
      The charter to chastise which she bestows
      On such as wield her weapons; he had kept
    The whiteness of his soul--and thus men o'er him wept.

                             LVIII.

    Here Ehrenbreitstein, with her shattered wall
      Black with the miner's blast, upon her height
      Yet shows of what she was, when shell and ball
      Rebounding idly on her strength did light:--
      A Tower of Victory! from whence the flight
      Of baffled foes was watched along the plain:
      But Peace destroyed what War could never blight,
      And laid those proud roofs bare to Summer's rain--
    On which the iron shower for years had poured in vain.

                              LIX.

    Adieu to thee, fair Rhine! How long delighted
      The stranger fain would linger on his way!
      Thine is a scene alike where souls united
      Or lonely Contemplation thus might stray;
      And could the ceaseless vultures cease to prey
      On self-condemning bosoms, it were here,
      Where Nature, nor too sombre nor too gay,
      Wild but not rude, awful yet not austere,
    Is to the mellow Earth as Autumn to the year.

                              LX.

    Adieu to thee again! a vain adieu!
      There can be no farewell to scene like thine;
      The mind is coloured by thy every hue;
      And if reluctantly the eyes resign
      Their cherished gaze upon thee, lovely Rhine!
      'Tis with the thankful glance of parting praise;
      More mighty spots may rise--more glaring shine,
      But none unite in one attaching maze
    The brilliant, fair, and soft,--the glories of old days,

                              LXI.

    The negligently grand, the fruitful bloom
      Of coming ripeness, the white city's sheen,
      The rolling stream, the precipice's gloom,
      The forest's growth, and Gothic walls between,--
      The wild rocks shaped, as they had turrets been,
      In mockery of man's art; and these withal
      A race of faces happy as the scene,
      Whose fertile bounties here extend to all,
    Still springing o'er thy banks, though Empires near them fall.

                             LXII.

    But these recede. Above me are the Alps,
      The Palaces of Nature, whose vast walls
      Have pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps,
      And throned Eternity in icy halls
      Of cold Sublimity, where forms and falls
      The Avalanche--the thunderbolt of snow!
      All that expands the spirit, yet appals,
      Gather around these summits, as to show
    How Earth may pierce to Heaven, yet leave vain man below.

                             LXIII.

    But ere these matchless heights I dare to scan,
      There is a spot should not be passed in vain,--
      Morat! the proud, the patriot field! where man
      May gaze on ghastly trophies of the slain,
      Nor blush for those who conquered on that plain;
      Here Burgundy bequeathed his tombless host,
      A bony heap, through ages to remain,
      Themselves their monument;--the Stygian coast
    Unsepulchred they roamed, and shrieked each
                                           wandering ghost.

                             LXIV.

    While Waterloo with Cannae's carnage vies,
      Morat and Marathon twin names shall stand;
      They were true Glory's stainless victories,
      Won by the unambitious heart and hand
      Of a proud, brotherly, and civic band,
      All unbought champions in no princely cause
      Of vice-entailed Corruption; they no land
      Doomed to bewail the blasphemy of laws
    Making Kings' rights divine, by some Draconic clause.

                              LXV.

    By a lone wall a lonelier column rears
      A gray and grief-worn aspect of old days;
      'Tis the last remnant of the wreck of years,
      And looks as with the wild-bewildered gaze
      Of one to stone converted by amaze,
      Yet still with consciousness; and there it stands
      Making a marvel that it not decays,
      When the coeval pride of human hands,
    Levelled Aventicum, hath strewed her subject lands.

                             LXVI.

    And there--oh! sweet and sacred be the name!--
      Julia--the daughter--the devoted--gave
      Her youth to Heaven; her heart, beneath a claim
      Nearest to Heaven's, broke o'er a father's grave.
      Justice is sworn 'gainst tears, and hers would crave
      The life she lived in--but the Judge was just--
      And then she died on him she could not save.
      Their tomb was simple, and without a bust,
    And held within their urn one mind--one heart--one dust.

                             LXVII.

    But these are deeds which should not pass away,
      And names that must not wither, though the Earth
      Forgets her empires with a just decay,
      The enslavers and the enslaved--their death and birth;
      The high, the mountain-majesty of Worth
      Should be--and shall, survivor of its woe,
      And from its immortality, look forth
      In the sun's face, like yonder Alpine snow,
    Imperishably pure beyond all things below.

                            LXVIII.

    Lake Leman woos me with its crystal face,
      The mirror where the stars and mountains view
      The stillness of their aspect in each trace
      Its clear depth yields of their far height and hue:
      There is too much of Man here, to look through
      With a fit mind the might which I behold;
      But soon in me shall Loneliness renew
      Thoughts hid, but not less cherished than of old,
    Ere mingling with the herd had penned me in their fold.

                             LXIX.

    To fly from, need not be to hate, mankind:
      All are not fit with them to stir and toil,
      Nor is it discontent to keep the mind
      Deep in its fountain, lest it overboil
      In the hot throng, where we become the spoil
      Of our infection, till too late and long
      We may deplore and struggle with the coil,
      In wretched interchange of wrong for wrong
    Midst a contentious world, striving where none are strong.

                              LXX.

    There, in a moment, we may plunge our years
      In fatal penitence, and in the blight
      Of our own Soul turn all our blood to tears,
      And colour things to come with hues of Night;
      The race of life becomes a hopeless flight
      To those that walk in darkness: on the sea
      The boldest steer but where their ports invite--
      But there are wanderers o'er Eternity
    Whose bark drives on and on, and anchored ne'er shall be.

                             LXXI.

    Is it not better, then, to be alone,
      And love Earth only for its earthly sake?
      By the blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone,
      Or the pure bosom of its nursing Lake,
      Which feeds it as a mother who doth make
      A fair but froward infant her own care,
      Kissing its cries away as these awake;--
      Is it not better thus our lives to wear,
    Than join the crushing crowd, doomed to inflict or bear?

                             LXXII.

    I live not in myself, but I become
      Portion of that around me; and to me
      High mountains are a feeling, but the hum
      Of human cities torture: I can see
      Nothing to loathe in Nature, save to be
      A link reluctant in a fleshly chain,
      Classed among creatures, when the soul can flee,
      And with the sky--the peak--the heaving plain
    Of Ocean, or the stars, mingle--and not in vain.

                            LXXIII.

    And thus I am absorbed, and this is life:--
      I look upon the peopled desert past,
      As on a place of agony and strife,
      Where, for some sin, to Sorrow I was cast,
      To act and suffer, but remount at last
      With a fresh pinion; which I feel to spring,
      Though young, yet waxing vigorous as the Blast
      Which it would cope with, on delighted wing,
    Spurning the clay-cold bonds which round our being cling.

                             LXXIV.

    And when, at length, the mind shall be all free
      From what it hates in this degraded form,
      Reft of its carnal life, save what shall be
      Existent happier in the fly and worm,--
      When Elements to Elements conform,
      And dust is as it should be, shall I not
      Feel all I see less dazzling but more warm?
      The bodiless thought? the Spirit of each spot?
    Of which, even now, I share at times the immortal lot?

                             LXXV.

    Are not the mountains, waves, and skies, a part
      Of me and of my Soul, as I of them?
      Is not the love of these deep in my heart
      With a pure passion? should I not contemn
      All objects, if compared with these? and stem
      A tide of suffering, rather than forego
      Such feelings for the hard and worldly phlegm
      Of those whose eyes are only turned below,
    Gazing upon the ground, with thoughts which dare not glow?

                             LXXVI.

    But this is not my theme; and I return
      To that which is immediate, and require
      Those who find contemplation in the urn,
      To look on One, whose dust was once all fire,--
      A native of the land where I respire
      The clear air for a while--a passing guest,
      Where he became a being,--whose desire
      Was to be glorious; 'twas a foolish quest,
    The which to gain and keep, he sacrificed all rest.

                            LXXVII.

    Here the self-torturing sophist, wild Rousseau,
      The apostle of Affliction, he who threw
      Enchantment over Passion, and from Woe
      Wrung overwhelming eloquence, first drew
      The breath which made him wretched; yet he knew
      How to make Madness beautiful, and cast
      O'er erring deeds and thoughts, a heavenly hue
      Of words, like sunbeams, dazzling as they past
    The eyes, which o'er them shed tears feelingly and fast.

                            LXXVIII.

    His love was Passion's essence--as a tree
      On fire by lightning; with ethereal flame
      Kindled he was, and blasted; for to be
      Thus, and enamoured, were in him the same.
      But his was not the love of living dame,
      Nor of the dead who rise upon our dreams,
      But of ideal Beauty, which became
      In him existence, and o'erflowing teems
    Along his burning page, distempered though it seems.

                             LXXIX.

    This breathed itself to life in Julie, this
      Invested her with all that's wild and sweet;
      This hallowed, too, the memorable kiss
      Which every morn his fevered lip would greet,
      From hers, who but with friendship his would meet;
      But to that gentle touch, through brain and breast
      Flashed the thrilled Spirit's love-devouring heat;
      In that absorbing sigh perchance more blest
    Than vulgar minds may be with all they seek possest.

                             LXXX.

    His life was one long war with self-sought foes,
      Or friends by him self-banished; for his mind
      Had grown Suspicion's sanctuary, and chose,
      For its own cruel sacrifice, the kind,
      'Gainst whom he raged with fury strange and blind.
      But he was phrensied, wherefore, who may know?
      Since cause might be which Skill could never find;
      But he was phrensied by disease or woe,
    To that worst pitch of all, which wears a reasoning show.

                             LXXXI.

    For then he was inspired, and from him came,
      As from the Pythian's mystic cave of yore,
      Those oracles which set the world in flame,
      Nor ceased to burn till kingdoms were no more:
      Did he not this for France? which lay before
      Bowed to the inborn tyranny of years?
      Broken and trembling to the yoke she bore,
      Till by the voice of him and his compeers,
    Roused up to too much wrath which follows o'ergrown fears?

                            LXXXII.

    They made themselves a fearful monument!
      The wreck of old opinions--things which grew,
      Breathed from the birth of Time: the veil they rent,
      And what behind it lay, all earth shall view.
      But good with ill they also overthrew,
      Leaving but ruins, wherewith to rebuild
      Upon the same foundation, and renew
      Dungeons and thrones, which the same hour refilled,
    As heretofore, because Ambition was self-willed.

                            LXXXIII.

    But this will not endure, nor be endured!
      Mankind have felt their strength, and made it felt.
      They might have used it better, but, allured
      By their new vigour, sternly have they dealt
      On one another; Pity ceased to melt
      With her once natural charities. But they,
      Who in Oppression's darkness caved had dwelt,
      They were not eagles, nourished with the day;
    What marvel then, at times, if they mistook their prey?

                            LXXXIV.

    What deep wounds ever closed without a scar?
      The heart's bleed longest, and but heal to wear
      That which disfigures it; and they who war
      With their own hopes, and have been vanquished, bear
      Silence, but not submission: in his lair
      Fixed Passion holds his breath, until the hour
      Which shall atone for years; none need despair:
      It came--it cometh--and will come,--the power
    To punish or forgive--in one we shall be slower.

                             LXXXV.

    Clear, placid Leman! thy contrasted lake,
      With the wild world I dwelt in, is a thing
      Which warns me, with its stillness, to forsake
      Earth's troubled waters for a purer spring.
      This quiet sail is as a noiseless wing
      To waft me from distraction; once I loved
      Torn Ocean's roar, but thy soft murmuring
      Sounds sweet as if a Sister's voice reproved,
    That I with stern delights should e'er have been so moved.

                            LXXXVI.

    It is the hush of night, and all between
      Thy margin and the mountains, dusk, yet clear,
      Mellowed and mingling, yet distinctly seen,
      Save darkened Jura, whose capt heights appear
      Precipitously steep; and drawing near,
      There breathes a living fragrance from the shore,
      Of flowers yet fresh with childhood; on the ear
      Drops the light drip of the suspended oar,
    Or chirps the grasshopper one good-night carol more.

                            LXXXVII.

    He is an evening reveller, who makes
      His life an infancy, and sings his fill;
      At intervals, some bird from out the brakes
      Starts into voice a moment, then is still.
      There seems a floating whisper on the hill,
      But that is fancy--for the Starlight dews
      All silently their tears of Love instil,
      Weeping themselves away, till they infuse
    Deep into Nature's breast the spirit of her hues.

                           LXXXVIII.

    Ye Stars! which are the poetry of Heaven!
      If in your bright leaves we would read the fate
      Of men and empires,--'tis to be forgiven,
      That in our aspirations to be great,
      Our destinies o'erleap their mortal state,
      And claim a kindred with you; for ye are
      A Beauty and a Mystery, and create
      In us such love and reverence from afar,
    That Fortune,--Fame,--Power,--Life, have named themselves a Star.

                            LXXXIX.

    All Heaven and Earth are still--though not in sleep,
      But breathless, as we grow when feeling most;
      And silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep:--
      All Heaven and Earth are still: From the high host
      Of stars, to the lulled lake and mountain-coast,
      All is concentered in a life intense,
      Where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,
      But hath a part of Being, and a sense
    Of that which is of all Creator and Defence.

                              XC.

    Then stirs the feeling infinite, so felt
      In solitude, where we are least alone;
      A truth, which through our being then doth melt,
      And purifies from self: it is a tone,
      The soul and source of Music, which makes known
      Eternal harmony, and sheds a charm
      Like to the fabled Cytherea's zone,
      Binding all things with beauty;--'twould disarm
    The spectre Death, had he substantial power to harm.

                              XCI.

    Not vainly did the early Persian make
      His altar the high places, and the peak
      Of earth-o'ergazing mountains, --and thus take
      A fit and unwalled temple, there to seek
      The Spirit, in whose honour shrines are weak
      Upreared of human hands. Come, and compare
      Columns and idol-dwellings--Goth or Greek--
      With Nature's realms of worship, earth and air--
    Nor fix on fond abodes to circumscribe thy prayer!

                             XCII.

    The sky is changed!--and such a change! Oh Night,
      And Storm, and Darkness, ye are wondrous strong,
      Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light
      Of a dark eye in Woman! Far along,
      From peak to peak, the rattling crags among
      Leaps the live thunder! Not from one lone cloud,
      But every mountain now hath found a tongue,
      And Jura answers, through her misty shroud,
    Back to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud!

                             XCIII.

    And this is in the Night:--Most glorious Night!
      Thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be
      A sharer in thy fierce and far delight,--
      A portion of the tempest and of thee!
      How the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,
      And the big rain comes dancing to the earth!
      And now again 'tis black,--and now, the glee
      Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain-mirth,
    As if they did rejoice o'er a young Earthquake's birth.

                             XCIV.

    Now, where the swift Rhone cleaves his way between
      Heights which appear as lovers who have parted
      In hate, whose mining depths so intervene,
      That they can meet no more, though broken-hearted:
      Though in their souls, which thus each other thwarted,
      Love was the very root of the fond rage
      Which blighted their life's bloom, and then departed:--
      Itself expired, but leaving them an age
    Of years all winters,--war within themselves to wage:

                              XCV.

    Now, where the quick Rhone thus hath cleft his way,
      The mightiest of the storms hath ta'en his stand:
      For here, not one, but many, make their play,
      And fling their thunder-bolts from hand to hand,
      Flashing and cast around: of all the band,
      The brightest through these parted hills hath forked
      His lightnings,--as if he did understand,
      That in such gaps as Desolation worked,
    There the hot shaft should blast whatever therein lurked.

                             XCVI.

    Sky--Mountains--River--Winds--Lake--Lightnings! ye!
      With night, and clouds, and thunder--and a Soul
      To make these felt and feeling, well may be
      Things that have made me watchful; the far roll
      Of your departing voices, is the knoll
      Of what in me is sleepless,--if I rest.
      But where of ye, O Tempests! is the goal?
      Are ye like those within the human breast?
    Or do ye find, at length, like eagles, some high nest?

                             XCVII.

    Could I embody and unbosom now
      That which is most within me,--could I wreak
      My thoughts upon expression, and thus throw
      Soul--heart--mind--passions--feelings--strong or weak--
      All that I would have sought, and all I seek,
      Bear, know, feel--and yet breathe--into one word,
      And that one word were Lightning, I would speak;
      But as it is, I live and die unheard,
    With a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword.

                            XCVIII.

    The Morn is up again, the dewy Morn,
      With breath all incense, and with cheek all bloom--
      Laughing the clouds away with playful scorn,
      And living as if earth contained no tomb,--
      And glowing into day: we may resume
      The march of our existence: and thus I,
      Still on thy shores, fair Leman! may find room
      And food for meditation, nor pass by
    Much, that may give us pause, if pondered fittingly.

                             XCIX.

    Clarens! sweet Clarens birthplace of deep Love!
      Thine air is the young breath of passionate Thought;
      Thy trees take root in Love; the snows above,
      The very Glaciers have his colours caught,
      And Sun-set into rose-hues sees them wrought
      By rays which sleep there lovingly: the rocks,
      The permanent crags, tell here of Love, who sought
      In them a refuge from the worldly shocks,
    Which stir and sting the Soul with Hope that woos, then mocks.

                               C.

    Clarens! by heavenly feet thy paths are trod,--
      Undying Love's, who here ascends a throne
      To which the steps are mountains; where the God
      Is a pervading Life and Light,--so shown
      Not on those summits solely, nor alone
      In the still cave and forest; o'er the flower
      His eye is sparkling, and his breath hath blown,
      His soft and summer breath, whose tender power
    Passes the strength of storms in their most desolate hour.

                              CI.

    All things are here of Him; from the black pines,
      Which are his shade on high, and the loud roar
      Of torrents, where he listeneth, to the vines
      Which slope his green path downward to the shore,
      Where the bowed Waters meet him, and adore,
      Kissing his feet with murmurs; and the Wood,
      The covert of old trees, with trunks all hoar,
      But light leaves, young as joy, stands where it stood,
    Offering to him, and his, a populous solitude.

                              CII.

    A populous solitude of bees and birds,
      And fairy-formed and many-coloured things,
      Who worship him with notes more sweet than words,
      And innocently open their glad wings,
      Fearless and full of life: the gush of springs,
      And fall of lofty fountains, and the bend
      Of stirring branches, and the bud which brings
      The swiftest thought of Beauty, here extend
    Mingling--and made by Love--unto one mighty end.

                             CIII.

    He who hath loved not, here would learn that lore,
      And make his heart a spirit; he who knows
      That tender mystery, will love the more;
      For this is Love's recess, where vain men's woes,
      And the world's waste, have driven him far from those,
      For 'tis his nature to advance or die;
      He stands not still, but or decays, or grows
      Into a boundless blessing, which may vie
    With the immortal lights, in its eternity!

                              CIV.

    'Twas not for fiction chose Rousseau this spot,
      Peopling it with affections; but he found
      It was the scene which Passion must allot
      To the Mind's purified beings; 'twas the ground
      Where early Love his Psyche's zone unbound,
      And hallowed it with loveliness: 'tis lone,
      And wonderful, and deep, and hath a sound,
      And sense, and sight of sweetness; here the Rhone
    Hath spread himself a couch, the Alps have reared a throne.

    Lausanne! and Ferney! ye have been the abodes
      Of Names which unto you bequeathed a name;
      Mortals, who sought and found, by dangerous roads,
      A path to perpetuity of Fame:
      They were gigantic minds, and their steep aim
      Was, Titan-like, on daring doubts to pile
      Thoughts which should call down thunder, and the flame
      Of Heaven again assailed--if Heaven, the while,
    On man and man's research could deign do more than smile.

    The one was fire and fickleness, a child
      Most mutable in wishes, but in mind
      A wit as various,--gay, grave, sage, or wild,--
      Historian, bard, philosopher, combined;
      He multiplied himself among mankind,
      The Proteus of their talents: But his own
      Breathed most in ridicule,--which, as the wind,
      Blew where it listed, laying all things prone,--
    Now to o'erthrow a fool, and now to shake a throne.

    The other, deep and slow, exhausting thought,
      And hiving wisdom with each studious year,
      In meditation dwelt--with learning wrought,
      And shaped his weapon with an edge severe,
      Sapping a solemn creed with solemn sneer;
      The lord of irony,--that master-spell,
      Which stung his foes to wrath, which grew from fear
      And doomed him to the zealot's ready Hell,
    Which answers to all doubts so eloquently well.

    Yet, peace be with their ashes,--for by them,
      If merited, the penalty is paid;
      It is not ours to judge,--far less condemn;
      The hour must come when such things shall be made
      Known unto all,--or hope and dread allayed
      By slumber, on one pillow, in the dust,
      Which, thus much we are sure, must lie decayed;
      And when it shall revive, as is our trust,
    'Twill be to be forgiven--or suffer what is just.

    But let me quit Man's works, again to read
      His Maker's, spread around me, and suspend
      This page, which from my reveries I feed,
      Until it seems prolonging without end.
      The clouds above me to the white Alps tend,
      And I must pierce them, and survey whate'er
      May be permitted, as my steps I bend
      To their most great and growing region, where
    The earth to her embrace compels the powers of air.

    Italia too! Italia! looking on thee,
      Full flashes on the Soul the light of ages,
      Since the fierce Carthaginian almost won thee,
      To the last halo of the Chiefs and Sages
      Who glorify thy consecrated pages;
      Thou wert the throne and grave of empires; still,
      The fount at which the panting Mind assuages
      Her thirst of knowledge, quaffing there her fill,
    Flows from the eternal source of Rome's imperial hill.

    Thus far have I proceeded in a theme
      Renewed with no kind auspices:--to feel
      We are not what we have been, and to deem
      We are not what we should be,--and to steel
      The heart against itself; and to conceal,
      With a proud caution, love, or hate, or aught,--
      Passion or feeling, purpose, grief, or zeal,--
      Which is the tyrant Spirit of our thought,
    Is a stern task of soul:--No matter,--it is taught.

                             CXII.

    And for these words, thus woven into song,
      It may be that they are a harmless wile,--
      The colouring of the scenes which fleet along,
      Which I would seize, in passing, to beguile
      My breast, or that of others, for a while.
      Fame is the thirst of youth,--but I am not
      So young as to regard men's frown or smile,
      As loss or guerdon of a glorious lot;--
    I stood and stand alone,--remembered or forgot.

                             CXIII.

    I have not loved the World, nor the World me;
      I have not flattered its rank breath, nor bowed
      To its idolatries a patient knee,
      Nor coined my cheek to smiles,--nor cried aloud
      In worship of an echo: in the crowd
      They could not deem me one of such--I stood
      Among them, but not of them--in a shroud
      Of thoughts which were not their thoughts, and still could,
    Had I not filed my mind, which thus itself subdued.

                             CXIV.

    I have not loved the World, nor the World me,--
      But let us part fair foes; I do believe,
      Though I have found them not, that there may be
      Words which are things,--hopes which will not deceive,
      And Virtues which are merciful, nor weave
      Snares for the failing; I would also deem
      O'er others' griefs that some sincerely grieve--
      That two, or one, are almost what they seem,--
    That Goodness is no name--and Happiness no dream.

    My daughter! with thy name this song begun!
      My daughter! with thy name thus much shall end!--
      I see thee not--I hear thee not--but none
      Can be so wrapt in thee; Thou art the Friend
      To whom the shadows of far years extend:
      Albeit my brow thou never should'st behold,
      My voice shall with thy future visions blend,
      And reach into thy heart,--when mine is cold,--
    A token and a tone, even from thy father's mould.

                             CXVI.

    To aid thy mind's developement,--to watch
      Thy dawn of little joys,--to sit and see
      Almost thy very growth,--to view thee catch
      Knowledge of objects,--wonders yet to thee!
      To hold thee lightly on a gentle knee,
      And print on thy soft cheek a parent's kiss,--
      This, it should seem, was not reserved for me--
      Yet this was in my nature:--as it is,
    I know not what is there, yet something like to this.

                             CXVII.

    Yet, though dull Hate as duty should be taught,
      I know that thou wilt love me: though my name
      Should be shut from thee, as a spell still fraught
      With desolation, and a broken claim:
      Though the grave closed between us,--'twere the same,
      I know that thou wilt love me--though to drain
      My blood from out thy being were an aim,
      And an attainment,--all would be in vain,--
    Still thou would'st love me, still that more than life retain.

    The child of Love! though born in bitterness,
      And nurtured in Convulsion! Of thy sire
      These were the elements,--and thine no less.
      As yet such are around thee,--but thy fire
      Shall be more tempered, and thy hope far higher!
      Sweet be thy cradled slumbers! O'er the sea
      And from the mountains where I now respire,
      Fain would I waft such blessing upon thee,
    As--with a sigh--I deem thou might'st have been to me!

                     Quel monte che divide, e quel che serra
                   Italia, e un mare e l'altro che la bagna."

                               I.

    I stood in Venice, on the "Bridge of Sighs;"
      A Palace and a prison on each hand:
      I saw from out the wave her structures rise
      As from the stroke of the Enchanter's wand:
      A thousand Years their cloudy wings expand
      Around me, and a dying Glory smiles
      O'er the far times, when many a subject land
      Looked to the winged Lion's marble piles,
    Where Venice sate in state, throned on her hundred isles!

                              II.

    She looks a sea Cybele, fresh from Ocean,
      Rising with her tiara of proud towers
      At airy distance, with majestic motion,
      A Ruler of the waters and their powers:
      And such she was;--her daughters had their dowers
      From spoils of nations, and the exhaustless East
      Poured in her lap all gems in sparkling showers.
      In purple was she robed, and of her feast
    Monarchs partook, and deemed their dignity increased.

                              III.

    In Venice Tasso's echoes are no more,
      And silent rows the songless Gondolier;
      Her palaces are crumbling to the shore,
      And Music meets not always now the ear:
      Those days are gone--but Beauty still is here.
      States fall--Arts fade--but Nature doth not die,
      Nor yet forget how Venice once was dear,
      The pleasant place of all festivity,
    The Revel of the earth--the Masque of Italy!

                              IV.

    But unto us she hath a spell beyond
      Her name in story, and her long array
      Of mighty shadows, whose dim forms despond
      Above the Dogeless city's vanished sway;
      Ours is a trophy which will not decay
      With the Rialto; Shylock and the Moor,
      And Pierre, can not be swept or worn away--
      The keystones of the Arch! though all were o'er,
    For us repeopled were the solitary shore.

                               V.

    The Beings of the Mind are not of clay:
      Essentially immortal, they create
      And multiply in us a brighter ray
      And more beloved existence: that which Fate
      Prohibits to dull life in this our state
      Of mortal bondage, by these Spirits supplied,
      First exiles, then replaces what we hate;
      Watering the heart whose early flowers have died,
    And with a fresher growth replenishing the void.

                              VI.

    Such is the refuge of our youth and age--
      The first from Hope, the last from Vacancy;
      And this wan feeling peoples many a page--
      And, may be, that which grows beneath mine eye:
      Yet there are things whose strong reality
      Outshines our fairy-land; in shape and hues
      More beautiful than our fantastic sky,
      And the strange constellations which the Muse
    O'er her wild universe is skilful to diffuse:

                              VII.

    I saw or dreamed of such,--but let them go,--
      They came like Truth--and disappeared like dreams;
      And whatsoe'er they were--are now but so:
      I could replace them if I would; still teems
      My mind with many a form which aptly seems
      Such as I sought for, and at moments found;
      Let these too go--for waking Reason deems
      Such over-weening phantasies unsound,
    And other voices speak, and other sights surround.

                             VIII.

    I've taught me other tongues--and in strange eyes
      Have made me not a stranger; to the mind
      Which is itself, no changes bring surprise;
      Nor is it harsh to make, nor hard to find
      A country with--aye, or without mankind;
      Yet was I born where men are proud to be,--
      Not without cause; and should I leave behind
      The inviolate Island of the sage and free,
    And seek me out a home by a remoter sea,

                              IX.

    Perhaps I loved it well; and should I lay
      My ashes in a soil which is not mine,
      My Spirit shall resume it--if we may
      Unbodied choose a sanctuary. I twine
      My hopes of being remembered in my line
      With my land's language: if too fond and far
      These aspirations in their scope incline,--
      If my Fame should be, as my fortunes are,
    Of hasty growth and blight, and dull Oblivion bar

                               X.

    My name from out the temple where the dead
      Are honoured by the Nations--let it be--
      And light the Laurels on a loftier head!
      And be the Spartan's epitaph on me--
      "Sparta hath many a worthier son than he."
      Meantime I seek no sympathies, nor need--
      The thorns which I have reaped are of the tree
      I planted,--they have torn me,--and I bleed:
    I should have known what fruit would spring from such a seed.

                              XI.

    The spouseless Adriatic mourns her Lord,
      And annual marriage now no more renewed--
      The Bucentaur lies rotting unrestored,
      Neglected garment of her widowhood!
      St. Mark yet sees his Lion where he stood
      Stand, but in mockery of his withered power,
      Over the proud Place where an Emperor sued,
      And monarchs gazed and envied in the hour
    When Venice was a Queen with an unequalled dower.

                              XII.

    The Suabian sued, and now the Austrian reigns--
      An Emperor tramples where an Emperor knelt;
      Kingdoms are shrunk to provinces, and chains
      Clank over sceptred cities; Nations melt
      From Power's high pinnacle, when they have felt
      The sunshine for a while, and downward go
      Like Lauwine loosened from the mountain's belt;
      Oh for one hour of blind old Dandolo!
    Th' octogenarian chief, Byzantium's conquering foe.

                             XIII.

    Before St. Mark still glow his Steeds of brass,
      Their gilded collars glittering in the sun;
      But is not Doria's menace come to pass?
      Are they not bridled?--Venice, lost and won,
      Her thirteen hundred years of freedom done,
      Sinks, like a sea-weed, unto whence she rose!
      Better be whelmed beneath the waves, and shun,
      Even in Destruction's depth, her foreign foes,
    From whom Submission wrings an infamous repose.

                              XIV.

    In youth She was all glory,--a new Tyre,--
      Her very by-word sprung from Victory,
      The "Planter of the Lion," which through fire
      And blood she bore o'er subject Earth and Sea;
      Though making many slaves, Herself still free,
      And Europe's bulwark 'gainst the Ottomite;
      Witness Troy's rival, Candia! Vouch it, ye
      Immortal waves that saw Lepanto's fight!
    For ye are names no Time nor Tyranny can blight.

                              XV.

    Statues of glass--all shivered--the long file
      Of her dead Doges are declined to dust;
      But where they dwelt, the vast and sumptuous pile
      Bespeaks the pageant of their splendid trust;
      Their sceptre broken, and their sword in rust,
      Have yielded to the stranger: empty halls,
      Thin streets, and foreign aspects, such as must
      Too oft remind her who and what enthrals,
    Have flung a desolate cloud o'er Venice' lovely walls.

                              XVI.

    When Athens' armies fell at Syracuse,
      And fettered thousands bore the yoke of war,
      Redemption rose up in the Attic Muse,
      Her voice their only ransom from afar:
      See! as they chant the tragic hymn, the car
      Of the o'ermastered Victor stops--the reins
      Fall from his hands--his idle scimitar
      Starts from its belt--he rends his captive's chains,
    And bids him thank the Bard for Freedom and his strains.

                             XVII.

    Thus, Venice! if no stronger claim were thine,
      Were all thy proud historic deeds forgot--
      Thy choral memory of the Bard divine,
      Thy love of Tasso, should have cut the knot
      Which ties thee to thy tyrants; and thy lot
      Is shameful to the nations,--most of all,
      Albion! to thee: the Ocean queen should not
      Abandon Ocean's children; in the fall
    Of Venice think of thine, despite thy watery wall.

                             XVIII.

    I loved her from my boyhood--she to me
      Was as a fairy city of the heart,
      Rising like water-columns from the sea--
      Of Joy the sojourn, and of Wealth the mart;
      And Otway, Radcliffe, Schiller, Shakespeare's art,
      Had stamped her image in me, and even so,
      Although I found her thus, we did not part;
      Perchance even dearer in her day of woe,
    Than when she was a boast, a marvel, and a show.

                              XIX.

    I can repeople with the past--and of
      The present there is still for eye and thought,
      And meditation chastened down, enough;
      And more, it may be, than I hoped or sought;
      And of the happiest moments which were wrought
      Within the web of my existence, some
      From thee, fair Venice! have their colours caught:
      There are some feelings Time can not benumb,
    Nor Torture shake, or mine would now be cold and dumb.

                              XX.

    But from their nature will the Tannen grow
      Loftiest on loftiest and least sheltered rocks,
      Rooted in barrenness, where nought below
      Of soil supports them 'gainst the Alpine shocks
      Of eddying storms; yet springs the trunk, and mocks
      The howling tempest, till its height and frame
      Are worthy of the mountains from whose blocks
      Of bleak, gray granite into life it came,
    And grew a giant tree;--the Mind may grow the same.

                              XXI.

    Existence may be borne, and the deep root
      Of life and sufferance make its firm abode
      In bare and desolated bosoms: mute
      The camel labours with the heaviest load,
      And the wolf dies in silence--not bestowed
      In vain should such example be; if they,
      Things of ignoble or of savage mood,
      Endure and shrink not, we of nobler clay
    May temper it to bear,--it is but for a day.

                             XXII.

    All suffering doth destroy, or is destroyed,
      Even by the sufferer--and, in each event,
      Ends:--Some, with hope replenished and rebuoyed,
      Return to whence they came--with like intent,
      And weave their web again; some, bowed and bent,
      Wax gray and ghastly, withering ere their time,
      And perish with the reed on which they leant;
      Some seek devotion--toil--war--good or crime,
    According as their souls were formed to sink or climb.

                             XXIII.

    But ever and anon of griefs subdued
      There comes a token like a Scorpion's sting,
      Scarce seen, but with fresh bitterness imbued;
      And slight withal may be the things which bring
      Back on the heart the weight which it would fling
      Aside for ever: it may be a sound--
      A tone of music--summer's eve--or spring--
      A flower--the wind--the Ocean--which shall wound,
    Striking the electric chain wherewith we are darkly bound;

                             XXIV.

    And how and why we know not, nor can trace
      Home to its cloud this lightning of the mind,
      But feel the shock renewed, nor can efface
      The blight and blackening which it leaves behind,
      Which out of things familiar, undesigned,
      When least we deem of such, calls up to view
      The Spectres whom no exorcism can bind,--
      The cold--the changed--perchance the dead, anew--
    The mourned--the loved--the lost--too many! yet how few!

                              XXV.

    But my Soul wanders; I demand it back
      To meditate amongst decay, and stand
      A ruin amidst ruins; there to track
      Fall'n states and buried greatness, o'er a land
      Which was the mightiest in its old command,
      And is the loveliest, and must ever be
      The master-mould of Nature's heavenly hand;
      Wherein were cast the heroic and the free,--
    The beautiful--the brave--the Lords of earth and sea,

                             XXVI.

    The Commonwealth of Kings--the Men of Rome!
      And even since, and now, fair Italy!
      Thou art the Garden of the World, the Home
      Of all Art yields, and Nature can decree;
      Even in thy desert, what is like to thee?
      Thy very weeds are beautiful--thy waste
      More rich than other climes' fertility;
      Thy wreck a glory--and thy ruin graced
    With an immaculate charm which cannot be defaced.

                             XXVII.

    The Moon is up, and yet it is not night--
      Sunset divides the sky with her--a sea
      Of glory streams along the Alpine height
      Of blue Friuli's mountains; Heaven is free
      From clouds, but of all colours seems to be,--
      Melted to one vast Iris of the West,--
      Where the Day joins the past Eternity;
      While, on the other hand, meek Dian's crest
    Floats through the azure air--an island of the blest!

                            XXVIII.

    A single star is at her side, and reigns
      With her o'er half the lovely heaven; but still
      Yon sunny Sea heaves brightly, and remains
      Rolled o'er the peak of the far Rhaetian hill,
      As Day and Night contending were, until
      Nature reclaimed her order:--gently flows
      The deep-dyed Brenta, where their hues instil
      The odorous purple of a new-born rose,
    Which streams upon her stream, and glassed within it glows,

                             XXIX.

    Filled with the face of heaven, which, from afar,
      Comes down upon the waters! all its hues,
      From the rich sunset to the rising star,
      Their magical variety diffuse:
      And now they change--a paler Shadow strews
      Its mantle o'er the mountains; parting Day
      Dies like the Dolphin, whom each pang imbues
      With a new colour as it gasps away--
    The last still loveliest, till--'tis gone--and all is gray.

                              XXX.

    There is a tomb in Arqua;--reared in air,
      Pillared in their sarcophagus, repose
      The bones of Laura's lover: here repair
      Many familiar with his well-sung woes,
      The Pilgrims of his Genius. He arose
      To raise a language, and his land reclaim
      From the dull yoke of her barbaric foes:
      Watering the tree which bears his Lady's name
    With his melodious tears, he gave himself to Fame.

                             XXXI.

    They keep his dust in Arqua, where he died--
      The mountain-village where his latter days
      Went down the vale of years; and 'tis their pride--
      An honest pride--and let it be their praise,
      To offer to the passing stranger's gaze
      His mansion and his sepulchre--both plain
      And venerably simple--such as raise
      A feeling more accordant with his strain
    Than if a Pyramid formed his monumental fane.

                             XXXII.

    And the soft quiet hamlet where he dwelt
      Is one of that complexion which seems made
      For those who their mortality have felt,
      And sought a refuge from their hopes decayed
      In the deep umbrage of a green hill's shade,
      Which shows a distant prospect far away
      Of busy cities, now in vain displayed,
      For they can lure no further; and the ray
    Of a bright Sun can make sufficient holiday,

                            XXXIII.

    Developing the mountains, leaves, and flowers,
      And shining in the brawling brook, where-by,
      Clear as its current, glide the sauntering hours
      With a calm languor, which, though to the eye
      Idlesse it seem, hath its morality--
      If from society we learn to live,
      'Tis Solitude should teach us how to die;
      It hath no flatterers--Vanity can give
    No hollow aid; alone--man with his God must strive:

                             XXXIV.

    Or, it may be, with Demons, who impair
      The strength of better thoughts, and seek their prey
      In melancholy bosoms--such as were
      Of moody texture from their earliest day,
      And loved to dwell in darkness and dismay
      Deeming themselves predestined to a doom
      Which is not of the pangs that pass away;
      Making the Sun like blood, the Earth a tomb,
    The tomb a hell--and Hell itself a murkier gloom.

                             XXXV.

    Ferrara! in thy wide and grass-grown streets,
      Whose symmetry was not for solitude,
      There seems as 'twere a curse upon the Seats
      Of former Sovereigns, and the antique brood
      Of Este, which for many an age made good
      Its strength within thy walls, and was of yore
      Patron or Tyrant, as the changing mood
      Of petty power impelled, of those who wore
    The wreath which Dante's brow alone had worn before.

                             XXXVI.

    And Tasso is their glory and their shame--
      Hark to his strain! and then survey his cell!
      And see how dearly earned Torquato's fame,
      And where Alfonso bade his poet dwell:
      The miserable Despot could not quell
      The insulted mind he sought to quench, and blend
      With the surrounding maniacs, in the hell
      Where he had plunged it. Glory without end
    Scattered the clouds away--and on that name attend

                            XXXVII.

    The tears and praises of all time, while thine
      Would rot in its oblivion--in the sink
      Of worthless dust, which from thy boasted line
      Is shaken into nothing--but the link
      Thou formest in his fortunes bids us think
      Of thy poor malice, naming thee with scorn:
      Alfonso! how thy ducal pageants shrink
      From thee! if in another station born,
    Scarce fit to be the slave of him thou mad'st to mourn:

                            XXXVIII.

    Thou! formed to eat, and be despised, and die,
      Even as the beasts that perish--save that thou
      Hadst a more splendid trough and wider sty:--
      He! with a glory round his furrowed brow,
      Which emanated then, and dazzles now,
      In face of all his foes, the Cruscan quire,
      And Boileau, whose rash envy could allow
      No strain which shamed his country's creaking lyre,
    That whetstone of the teeth--Monotony in wire!

                             XXXIX.

    Peace to Torquato's injured shade! 'twas his
      In life and death to be the mark where Wrong
      Aimed with her poisoned arrows,--but to miss.
      Oh, Victor unsurpassed in modern song!
      Each year brings forth its millions--but how long
      The tide of Generations shall roll on,
      And not the whole combined and countless throng
      Compose a mind like thine? though all in one
    Condensed their scattered rays--they would not form a Sun.

                              XL.

    Great as thou art, yet paralleled by those,
      Thy countrymen, before thee born to shine,
      The Bards of Hell and Chivalry: first rose
      The Tuscan Father's Comedy Divine;
      Then, not unequal to the Florentine,
      The southern Scott, the minstrel who called forth
      A new creation with his magic line,
      And, like the Ariosto of the North,
    Sang Ladye-love and War, Romance and Knightly Worth.

                              XLI.

    The lightning rent from Ariosto's bust
      The iron crown of laurel's mimicked leaves;
      Nor was the ominous element unjust,
      For the true laurel-wreath which Glory weaves
      Is of the tree no bolt of thunder cleaves,
      And the false semblance but disgraced his brow;
      Yet still, if fondly Superstition grieves,
      Know, that the lightning sanctifies below
    Whate'er it strikes;--yon head is doubly sacred now.

                             XLII.

    Italia! oh, Italia! thou who hast
      The fatal gift of Beauty, which became
      A funeral dower of present woes and past--
      On thy sweet brow is sorrow ploughed by shame,
      And annals graved in characters of flame.
      Oh, God! that thou wert in thy nakedness
      Less lovely or more powerful, and couldst claim
      Thy right, and awe the robbers back, who press
    To shed thy blood, and drink the tears of thy distress;

                             XLIII.

    Then might'st thou more appal--or, less desired,
      Be homely and be peaceful, undeplored
      For thy destructive charms; then, still untired,
      Would not be seen the armed torrents poured
      Down the deep Alps; nor would the hostile horde
      Of many-nationed spoilers from the Po
      Quaff blood and water; nor the stranger's sword
      Be thy sad weapon of defence--and so,
    Victor or vanquished, thou the slave of friend or foe.

                             XLIV.

    Wandering in youth, I traced the path of him,
      The Roman friend of Rome's least-mortal mind,
      The friend of Tully: as my bark did skim
      The bright blue waters with a fanning wind,
      Came Megara before me, and behind
      Aegina lay--Piraeus on the right,
      And Corinth on the left; I lay reclined
      Along the prow, and saw all these unite
    In ruin--even as he had seen the desolate sight;

                              XLV.

    For Time hath not rebuilt them, but upreared
      Barbaric dwellings on their shattered site,
      Which only make more mourned and more endeared
      The few last rays of their far-scattered light,
      And the crashed relics of their vanished might.
      The Roman saw these tombs in his own age,
      These sepulchres of cities, which excite
      Sad wonder, and his yet surviving page
    The moral lesson bears, drawn from such pilgrimage.

                             XLVI.

    That page is now before me, and on mine
      His Country's ruin added to the mass
      Of perished states he mourned in their decline,
      And I in desolation: all that was
      Of then destruction is; and now, alas!
      Rome--Rome imperial, bows her to the storm,
      In the same dust and blackness, and we pass
      The skeleton of her Titanic form,
    Wrecks of another world, whose ashes still are warm.

                             XLVII.

    Yet, Italy! through every other land
      Thy wrongs should ring--and shall--from side to side;
      Mother of Arts! as once of Arms! thy hand
      Was then our Guardian, and is still our Guide;
      Parent of our Religion! whom the wide
      Nations have knelt to for the keys of Heaven!
      Europe, repentant of her parricide,
      Shall yet redeem thee, and, all backward driven,
    Roll the barbarian tide, and sue to be forgiven.

                            XLVIII.

    But Arno wins us to the fair white walls,
      Where the Etrurian Athens claims and keeps
      A softer feeling for her fairy halls:
      Girt by her theatre of hills, she reaps
      Her corn, and wine, and oil--and Plenty leaps
      To laughing life, with her redundant Horn.
      Along the banks where smiling Arno sweeps
      Was modern Luxury of Commerce born,
    And buried Learning rose, redeemed to a new Morn.

                             XLIX.

    There, too, the Goddess loves in stone, and fills
      The air around with Beauty--we inhale
      The ambrosial aspect, which, beheld, instils
      Part of its immortality--the veil
      Of heaven is half undrawn--within the pale
      We stand, and in that form and face behold
      What Mind can make, when Nature's self would fail;
      And to the fond Idolaters of old
    Envy the innate flash which such a Soul could mould:

                               L.

    We gaze and turn away, and know not where,
      Dazzled and drunk with Beauty, till the heart
      Reels with its fulness; there--for ever there--
      Chained to the chariot of triumphal Art,
      We stand as captives, and would not depart.
      Away!--there need no words, nor terms precise,
      The paltry jargon of the marble mart,
      Where Pedantry gulls Folly--we have eyes:
    Blood--pulse--and breast confirm the Dardan Shepherd's prize.

                              LI.

    Appear'dst thou not to Paris in this guise?
      Or to more deeply blest Anchises? or,
      In all thy perfect Goddess-ship, when lies
      Before thee thy own vanquished Lord of War?
      And gazing in thy face as toward a star,
      Laid on thy lap, his eyes to thee upturn,
      Feeding on thy sweet cheek! while thy lips are
      With lava kisses melting while they burn,
    Showered on his eyelids, brow, and mouth, as from an urn!

                              LII.

    Glowing, and circumfused in speechless love--
      Their full divinity inadequate
      That feeling to express, or to improve--
      The Gods become as mortals--and man's fate
      Has moments like their brightest; but the weight
      Of earth recoils upon us;--let it go!
      We can recall such visions, and create,
      From what has been, or might be, things which grow
    Into thy statue's form, and look like gods below.

                             LIII.

    I leave to learned fingers, and wise hands,
      The Artist and his Ape, to teach and tell
      How well his Connoisseurship understands
      The graceful bend, and the voluptuous swell:
      Let these describe the undescribable:
      I would not their vile breath should crisp the stream
      Wherein that Image shall for ever dwell--
      The unruffled mirror of the loveliest dream
    That ever left the sky on the deep soul to beam.

                              LIV.

    In Santa Croce's holy precincts lie
      Ashes which make it holier, dust which is
      Even in itself an immortality,
      Though there were nothing save the past, and this,
      The particle of those sublimities
      Which have relapsed to chaos:--here repose
      Angelo's--Alfieri's bones--and his,
      The starry Galileo, with his woes;
    Here Machiavelli's earth returned to whence it rose.

                              LV.

    These are four minds, which, like the elements,
      Might furnish forth creation:--Italy!
      Time, which hath wronged thee with ten thousand rents
      Of thine imperial garment, shall deny
      And hath denied, to every other sky,
      Spirits which soar from ruin:--thy Decay
      Is still impregnate with divinity,
      Which gilds it with revivifying ray;
    Such as the great of yore, Canova is to-day.

                              LVI.

    But where repose the all Etruscan three--
      Dante, and Petrarch, and, scarce less than they,
      The Bard of Prose, creative Spirit! he
      Of the Hundred Tales of Love--where did they lay
      Their bones, distinguished from our common clay
      In death as life? Are they resolved to dust,
      And have their Country's Marbles nought to say?
      Could not her quarries furnish forth one bust?
    Did they not to her breast their filial earth entrust?

                             LVII.

    Ungrateful Florence! Dante sleeps afar,
      Like Scipio buried by the upbraiding shore:
      Thy factions, in their worse than civil war,
      Proscribed the Bard whose name for evermore
      Their children's children would in vain adore
      With the remorse of ages; and the crown
      Which Petrarch's laureate brow supremely wore,
      Upon a far and foreign soil had grown,
    His Life, his Fame, his Grave, though rifled--not thine own.

                             LVIII.

    Boccaccio to his parent earth bequeathed
      His dust,--and lies it not her Great among,
      With many a sweet and solemn requiem breathed
      O'er him who formed the Tuscan's siren tongue?
      That music in itself, whose sounds are song,
      The poetry of speech? No;--even his tomb
      Uptorn, must bear the hyaena bigot's wrong,
      No more amidst the meaner dead find room,
    Nor claim a passing sigh, because it told for whom!

                              LIX.

    And Santa Croce wants their mighty dust;
      Yet for this want more noted, as of yore
      The Caesar's pageant, shorn of Brutus' bust,
      Did but of Rome's best Son remind her more:
      Happier Ravenna! on thy hoary shore,
      Fortress of falling Empire! honoured sleeps
      The immortal Exile;--Arqua, too, her store
      Of tuneful relics proudly claims and keeps,
    While Florence vainly begs her banished dead and weeps.

                              LX.

    What is her Pyramid of precious stones?
      Of porphyry, jasper, agate, and all hues
      Of gem and marble, to encrust the bones
      Of merchant-dukes? the momentary dews
      Which, sparkling to the twilight stars, infuse
      Freshness in the green turf that wraps the dead,
      Whose names are Mausoleums of the Muse,
      Are gently prest with far more reverent tread
    Than ever paced the slab which paves the princely head.

                              LXI.

    There be more things to greet the heart and eyes
      In Arno's dome of Art's most princely shrine,
      Where Sculpture with her rainbow Sister vies;
      There be more marvels yet--but not for mine;
      For I have been accustomed to entwine
      My thoughts with Nature rather in the fields,
      Than Art in galleries: though a work divine
      Calls for my Spirit's homage, yet it yields
    Less than it feels, because the weapon which it wields

                             LXII.

    Is of another temper, and I roam
      By Thrasimene's lake, in the defiles
      Fatal to Roman rashness, more at home;
      For there the Carthaginian's warlike wiles
      Come back before me, as his skill beguiles
      The host between the mountains and the shore,
      Where Courage falls in her despairing files,
      And torrents, swoll'n to rivers with their gore,
    Reek through the sultry plain, with legions scattered o'er.

                             LXIII.

    Like to a forest felled by mountain winds;
      And such the storm of battle on this day,
      And such the frenzy, whose convulsion blinds
      To all save Carnage, that, beneath the fray,
      An Earthquake reeled unheededly away!
      None felt stern Nature rocking at his feet,
      And yawning forth a grave for those who lay
      Upon their bucklers for a winding sheet--
    Such is the absorbing hate when warring nations meet!

                             LXIV.

    The Earth to them was as a rolling bark
      Which bore them to Eternity--they saw
      The Ocean round, but had no time to mark
      The motions of their vessel; Nature's law,
      In them suspended, recked not of the awe
      Which reigns when mountains tremble, and the birds
      Plunge in the clouds for refuge, and withdraw
      From their down-toppling nests; and bellowing herds
    Stumble o'er heaving plains--and Man's dread hath no words.

                              LXV.

    Far other scene is Thrasimene now;
      Her lake a sheet of silver, and her plain
      Rent by no ravage save the gentle plough;
      Her aged trees rise thick as once the slain
      Lay where their roots are; but a brook hath ta'en--
      A little rill of scanty stream and bed--
      A name of blood from that day's sanguine rain;
      And Sanguinetto tells ye where the dead
    Made the earth wet, and turned the unwilling waters red.

                             LXVI.

    But thou, Clitumnus! in thy sweetest wave
      Of the most living crystal that was e'er
      The haunt of river-Nymph, to gaze and lave
      Her limbs where nothing hid them, thou dost rear
      Thy grassy banks whereon the milk-white steer
      Grazes--the purest God of gentle waters!
      And most serene of aspect, and most clear;
      Surely that stream was unprofaned by slaughters--
    A mirror and a bath for Beauty's youngest daughters!

                             LXVII.

    And on thy happy shore a Temple still,
      Of small and delicate proportion, keeps
      Upon a mild declivity of hill,
      Its memory of thee; beneath it sweeps
      Thy current's calmness; oft from out it leaps
      The finny darter with the glittering scales,
      Who dwells and revels in thy glassy deeps;
      While, chance, some scattered water-lily sails
    Down where the shallower wave still tells its bubbling tales.

                            LXVIII.

    Pass not unblest the Genius of the place!
      If through the air a Zephyr more serene
      Win to the brow, 'tis his; and if ye trace
      Along his margin a more eloquent green,
      If on the heart the freshness of the scene
      Sprinkle its coolness, and from the dry dust
      Of weary life a moment lave it clean
      With Nature's baptism,--'tis to him ye must
    Pay orisons for this suspension of disgust.

                             LXIX.

    The roar of waters!--from the headlong height
      Velino cleaves the wave-worn precipice;
      The fall of waters! rapid as the light
      The flashing mass foams shaking the abyss;
      The Hell of Waters! where they howl and hiss,
      And boil in endless torture; while the sweat
      Of their great agony, wrung out from this
      Their Phlegethon, curls round the rocks of jet
    That gird the gulf around, in pitiless horror set,

                              LXX.

    And mounts in spray the skies, and thence again
      Returns in an unceasing shower, which round,
      With its unemptied cloud of gentle rain,
      Is an eternal April to the ground,
      Making it all one emerald:--how profound
      The gulf! and how the Giant Element
      From rock to rock leaps with delirious bound,
      Crushing the cliffs, which, downward worn and rent
    With his fierce footsteps, yield in chasms a fearful vent

                             LXXI.

    To the broad column which rolls on, and shows
      More like the fountain of an infant sea
      Torn from the womb of mountains by the throes
      Of a new world, than only thus to be
      Parent of rivers, which flow gushingly,
      With many windings, through the vale:--Look back!
      Lo! where it comes like an Eternity,
      As if to sweep down all things in its track,
    Charming the eye with dread,--a matchless cataract,

                             LXXII.

    Horribly beautiful! but on the verge,
      From side to side, beneath the glittering morn,
      An Iris sits, amidst the infernal surge,
      Like Hope upon a death-bed, and, unworn
      Its steady dyes, while all around is torn
      By the distracted waters, bears serene
      Its brilliant hues with all their beams unshorn:
      Resembling, 'mid the torture of the scene,
    Love watching Madness with unalterable mien.

                            LXXIII.

    Once more upon the woody Apennine--
      The infant Alps, which--had I not before
      Gazed on their mightier Parents, where the pine
      Sits on more shaggy summits, and where roar
      The thundering Lauwine--might be worshipped more;
      But I have seen the soaring Jungfrau rear
      Her never-trodden snow, and seen the hoar
      Glaciers of bleak Mont Blanc both far and near--
    And in Chimari heard the Thunder-Hills of fear,

                             LXXIV.

    Th' Acroceraunian mountains of old name;
      And on Parnassus seen the Eagles fly
      Like Spirits of the spot, as 'twere for fame.
      For still they soared unutterably high:
      I've looked on Ida with a Trojan's eye;
      Athos--Olympus--Aetna.--Atlas--made
      These hills seem things of lesser dignity;
      All, save the lone Soracte's height, displayed
    Not now in snow, which asks the lyric Roman's aid

                             LXXV.

    For our remembrance, and from out the plain
      Heaves like a long-swept wave about to break,
      And on the curl hangs pausing: not in vain
      May he, who will, his recollections rake,
      And quote in classic raptures, and awake
      The hills with Latian echoes--I abhorred
      Too much, to conquer for the Poet's sake,
      The drilled dull lesson, forced down word by word
    In my repugnant youth, with pleasure to record

                             LXXVI.

    Aught that recalls the daily drug which turned
      My sickening memory; and, though Time hath taught
      My mind to meditate what then it learned,
      Yet such the fixed inveteracy wrought
      By the impatience of my early thought,
      That, with the freshness wearing out before
      My mind could relish what it might have sought,
      If free to choose, I cannot now restore
    Its health--but what it then detested, still abhor.

                            LXXVII.

    Then farewell, Horace--whom I hated so,
      Not for thy faults, but mine: it is a curse
      To understand, not feel thy lyric flow,
      To comprehend, but never love thy verse;
      Although no deeper Moralist rehearse
      Our little life, nor Bard prescribe his art,
      Nor livelier Satirist the conscience pierce,
      Awakening without wounding the touched heart,
    Yet fare thee well--upon Soracte's ridge we part.

                            LXXVIII.

    Oh, Rome! my Country! City of the Soul!
      The orphans of the heart must turn to thee,
      Lone Mother of dead Empires! and control
      In their shut breasts their petty misery.
      What are our woes and sufferance? Come and see
      The cypress--hear the owl--and plod your way
      O'er steps of broken thrones and temples--Ye!
      Whose agonies are evils of a day--
    A world is at our feet as fragile as our clay.

                             LXXIX.

    The Niobe of nations! there she stands,
      Childless and crownless, in her voiceless woe;
      empty urn within her withered hands,
      Whose holy dust was scattered long ago;
      The Scipios' tomb contains no ashes now;
      The very sepulchres lie tenantless
      Of their heroic dwellers: dost thou flow,
      Old Tiber! through a marble wilderness?
    Rise, with thy yellow waves, and mantle her distress.

                             LXXX.

    The Goth, the Christian--Time--War--Flood, and Fire,
      Have dealt upon the seven-hilled City's pride;
      She saw her glories star by star expire,
      And up the steep barbarian Monarchs ride,
      Where the car climbed the Capitol; far and wide
      Temple and tower went down, nor left a site:
      Chaos of ruins! who shall trace the void,
      O'er the dim fragments cast a lunar light,
    And say, "here was, or is," where all is doubly night?

                             LXXXI.

    The double night of ages, and of her,
      Night's daughter, Ignorance, hath wrapt and wrap
      All round us; we but feel our way to err:
      The Ocean hath his chart, the Stars their map,
      And Knowledge spreads them on her ample lap;
      But Rome is as the desert--where we steer
      Stumbling o'er recollections; now we clap
      Our hands, and cry "Eureka!" "it is clear"--
    When but some false Mirage of ruin rises near.

                            LXXXII.

    Alas! the lofty city! and alas!
      The trebly hundred triumphs! and the day
      When Brutus made the dagger's edge surpass
      The Conqueror's sword in bearing fame away!
      Alas, for Tully's voice, and Virgil's lay,
      And Livy's pictured page!--but these shall be
      Her resurrection; all beside--decay.
      Alas, for Earth, for never shall we see
    That brightness in her eye she bore when Rome was free!

                            LXXXIII.

    Oh, thou, whose chariot rolled on Fortune's wheel,
      Triumphant Sylla! Thou, who didst subdue
      Thy country's foes ere thou wouldst pause to feel
      The wrath of thy own wrongs, or reap the due
      Of hoarded vengeance till thine Eagles flew
      O'er prostrate Asia;--thou, who with thy frown
      Annihilated senates;--Roman, too,
      With all thy vices--for thou didst lay down
    With an atoning smile a more than earthly crown,

                            LXXXIV.

    Thy dictatorial wreath--couldst thou divine
      To what would one day dwindle that which made
      Thee more than mortal? and that so supine
      By aught than Romans Rome should thus be laid?
      She who was named Eternal, and arrayed
      Her warriors but to conquer--she who veiled
      Earth with her haughty shadow, and displayed,
      Until the o'er-canopied horizon failed,
    Her rushing wings--Oh! she who was Almighty hailed!

                             LXXXV.

    Sylla was first of victors; but our own,
      The sagest of usurpers, Cromwell!--he
      Too swept off senates while he hewed the throne
      Down to a block--immortal rebel! See
      What crimes it costs to be a moment free,
      And famous through all ages! but beneath
      His fate the moral lurks of destiny;
      His day of double victory and death
    Beheld him win two realms, and, happier, yield his breath.

                            LXXXVI.

    The third of the same Moon whose former course
      Had all but crowned him, on the selfsame day
      Deposed him gently from his throne of force,
      And laid him with the Earth's preceding clay.
      And showed not Fortune thus how fame and sway,
      And all we deem delightful, and consume
      Our souls to compass through each arduous way,
      Are in her eyes less happy than the tomb?
    Were they but so in Man's, how different were his doom!

                            LXXXVII.

    And thou, dread Statue! yet existent in
      The austerest form of naked majesty--
      Thou who beheldest, 'mid the assassins' din,
      At thy bathed base the bloody Caesar lie,
      Folding his robe in dying dignity--
      An offering to thine altar from the Queen
      Of gods and men, great Nemesis! did he die,
      And thou, too, perish, Pompey? have ye been
    Victors of countless kings, or puppets of a scene?

                           LXXXVIII.

    And thou, the thunder-stricken nurse of Rome!
      She-wolf! whose brazen-imaged dugs impart
      The milk of conquest yet within the dome
      Where, as a monument of antique art,
      Thou standest:--Mother of the mighty heart,
      Which the great Founder sucked from thy wild teat,
      Scorched by the Roman Jove's ethereal dart,
      And thy limbs black with lightning--dost thou yet
    Guard thine immortal cubs, nor thy fond charge forget?

                            LXXXIX.

    Thou dost;--but all thy foster-babes are dead--
      The men of iron; and the World hath reared
      Cities from out their sepulchres: men bled
      In imitation of the things they feared,
      And fought and conquered, and the same course steered,
      At apish distance; but as yet none have,
      Nor could, the same supremacy have neared,
      Save one vain Man, who is not in the grave--
    But, vanquished by himself, to his own slaves a slave--

                              XC.

    The fool of false dominion--and a kind
      Of bastard Caesar, following him of old
      With steps unequal; for the Roman's mind
      Was modelled in a less terrestrial mould,
      With passions fiercer, yet a judgment cold,
      And an immortal instinct which redeemed
      The frailties of a heart so soft, yet bold--
      Alcides with the distaff now he seemed
    At Cleopatra's feet,--and now himself he beamed,

                              XCI.

    And came--and saw--and conquered! But the man
      Who would have tamed his Eagles down to flee,
      Like a trained falcon, in the Gallic van,
      Which he, in sooth, long led to Victory,
      With a deaf heart which never seemed to be
      A listener to itself, was strangely framed;
      With but one weakest weakness--Vanity--
      Coquettish in ambition--still he aimed--
    And what? can he avouch, or answer what he claimed?

                             XCII.

    And would be all or nothing--nor could wait
      For the sure grave to level him; few years
      Had fixed him with the Caesars in his fate
      On whom we tread: For this the conqueror rears
      The Arch of Triumph! and for this the tears
      And blood of earth flow on as they have flowed,
      An universal Deluge, which appears
      Without an Ark for wretched Man's abode,
    And ebbs but to reflow!--Renew thy rainbow, God!

                             XCIII.

    What from this barren being do we reap?
      Our senses narrow, and our reason frail,
      Life short, and truth a gem which loves the deep,
      And all things weighed in Custom's falsest scale;
      Opinion an Omnipotence,--whose veil
      Mantles the earth with darkness, until right
      And wrong are accidents, and Men grow pale
      Lest their own judgments should become too bright,
    And their free thoughts be crimes, and Earth have too much light.

                             XCIV.

    And thus they plod in sluggish misery,
      Rotting from sire to son, and age to age,
      Proud of their trampled nature, and so die,
      Bequeathing their hereditary rage
      To the new race of inborn slaves, who wage
      War for their chains, and rather than be free,
      Bleed gladiator-like, and still engage
      Within the same Arena where they see
    Their fellows fall before, like leaves of the same tree.

                              XCV.

    I speak not of men's creeds--they rest between
      Man and his Maker--but of things allowed,
      Averred, and known, and daily, hourly seen--
      The yoke that is upon us doubly bowed,
      And the intent of Tyranny avowed,
      The edict of Earth's rulers, who are grown
      The apes of him who humbled once the proud,
      And shook them from their slumbers on the throne;
    Too glorious, were this all his mighty arm had done.

                             XCVI.

    Can tyrants but by tyrants conquered be,
      And Freedom find no Champion and no Child
      Such as Columbia saw arise when she
      Sprung forth a Pallas, armed and undefined?
      Or must such minds be nourished in the wild,
      Deep in the unpruned forest, 'midst the roar
      Of cataracts, where nursing Nature smiled
      On infant Washington? Has Earth no more
    Such seeds within her breast, or Europe no such shore?

                             XCVII.

    But France got drunk with blood to vomit crime;
      And fatal have her Saturnalia been
      To Freedom's cause, in every age and clime;
      Because the deadly days which we have seen,
      And vile Ambition, that built up between
      Man and his hopes an adamantine wall,
      And the base pageant last upon the scene,
      Are grown the pretext for the eternal thrall
    Which nips Life's tree, and dooms Man's worst--his second fall.

                            XCVIII.

    Yet, Freedom! yet thy banner, torn, but flying,
      Streams like the thunder-storm against the wind;
      Thy trumpet voice, though broken now and dying,
      The loudest still the Tempest leaves behind;
      Thy tree hath lost its blossoms, and the rind,
      Chopped by the axe, looks rough and little worth,
      But the sap lasts,--and still the seed we find
      Sown deep, even in the bosom of the North;
    So shall a better spring less bitter fruit bring forth.

                             XCIX.

    There is a stern round tower of other days
      Firm as a fortress, with its fence of stone,
      Such as an army's baffled strength delays,
      Standing with half its battlements alone,
      And with two thousand years of ivy grown,
      The garland of Eternity, where wave
      The green leaves over all by Time o'erthrown;--
      What was this tower of strength? within its cave
    What treasure lay so locked, so hid?--A woman's grave.

                               C.

    But who was she, the Lady of the dead,
      Tombed in a palace? Was she chaste and fair?
      Worthy a king's--or more--a Roman's bed?
      What race of Chiefs and Heroes did she bear?
      What daughter of her beauties was the heir?
      How lived--how loved--how died she? Was she not
      So honoured--and conspicuously there,
      Where meaner relics must not dare to rot,
    Placed to commemorate a more than mortal lot?

                              CI.

    Was she as those who love their lords, or they
      Who love the lords of others? such have been
      Even in the olden time, Rome's annals say.
      Was she a matron of Cornelia's mien,
      Or the light air of Egypt's graceful Queen,
      Profuse of joy--or 'gainst it did she war,
      Inveterate in virtue? Did she lean
      To the soft side of the heart, or wisely bar
    Love from amongst her griefs?--for such the affections are.

                              CII.

    Perchance she died in youth--it may be, bowed
      With woes far heavier than the ponderous tomb
      That weighed upon her gentle dust: a cloud
      Might gather o'er her beauty, and a gloom
      In her dark eye, prophetic of the doom
      Heaven gives its favourites--early death--yet shed
      A sunset charm around her, and illume
      With hectic light, the Hesperus of the dead,
    Of her consuming cheek the autumnal leaf-like red.

                             CIII.

    Perchance she died in age--surviving all,
      Charms--kindred--children--with the silver gray
      On her long tresses, which might yet recall,
      It may be, still a something of the day
      When they were braided, and her proud array
      And lovely form were envied, praised, and eyed
      By Rome--But whither would Conjecture stray?
      Thus much alone we know--Metella died,
    The wealthiest Roman's wife: Behold his love or pride!

                              CIV.

    I know not why--but standing thus by thee
      It seems as if I had thine inmate known,
      Thou Tomb! and other days come back on me
      With recollected music, though the tone
      Is changed and solemn, like the cloudy groan
      Of dying thunder on the distant wind;
      Yet could I seat me by this ivied stone
      Till I had bodied forth the heated mind
    Forms from the floating wreck which Ruin leaves behind:

                              CV.

    And from the planks, far shattered o'er the rocks,
      Built me a little bark of hope, once more
      To battle with the Ocean and the shocks
      Of the loud breakers, and the ceaseless roar
      Which rushes on the solitary shore
      Where all lies foundered that was ever dear:
      But could I gather from the wave-worn store
      Enough for my rude boat, where should I steer?
    There woos no home, nor hope, nor life, save what is here.

                              CVI.

    Then let the Winds howl on! their harmony
      Shall henceforth be my music, and the Night
      The sound shall temper with the owlets' cry,
      As I now hear them, in the fading light
      Dim o'er the bird of darkness' native site,
      Answering each other on the Palatine,
      With their large eyes, all glistening gray and bright,
      And sailing pinions.--Upon such a shrine
    What are our petty griefs?--let me not number mine.

                             CVII.

    Cypress and ivy, weed and wallflower grown
      Matted and massed together--hillocks heaped
      On what were chambers--arch crushed, column strown
      In fragments--choked up vaults, and frescos steeped
      In subterranean damps, where the owl peeped,
      Deeming it midnight:--Temples--Baths--or Halls?
      Pronounce who can: for all that Learning reaped
      From her research hath been, that these are walls--
    Behold the Imperial Mount! 'tis thus the Mighty falls.

                             CVIII.

    There is the moral of all human tales;
      'Tis but the same rehearsal of the past,
      First Freedom, and then Glory--when that fails,
      Wealth--Vice--Corruption,--Barbarism at last.
      And History, with all her volumes vast,
      Hath but one page,--'tis better written here,
      Where gorgeous Tyranny hath thus amassed
      All treasures, all delights, that Eye or Ear,
    Heart, Soul could seek--Tongue ask--Away with words! draw near,

                              CIX.

    Admire--exult--despise--laugh--weep,--for here
      There is such matter for all feeling:--Man!
      Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear,
      Ages and Realms are crowded in this span,
      This mountain, whose obliterated plan
      The pyramid of Empires pinnacled,
      Of Glory's gewgaws shining in the van
      Till the Sun's rays with added flame were filled!
    Where are its golden roofs? where those who dared to build?

                              CX.

    Tully was not so eloquent as thou,
      Thou nameless column with the buried base!
      What are the laurels of the Caesar's brow?
      Crown me with ivy from his dwelling-place.
      Whose arch or pillar meets me in the face,
      Titus or Trajan's? No--'tis that of Time:
      Triumph, arch, pillar, all he doth displace
      Scoffing; and apostolic statues climb
    To crush the imperial urn, whose ashes slept sublime,

                              CXI.

    Buried in air, the deep blue sky of Rome,
      And looking to the stars: they had contained
      A Spirit which with these would find a home,
      The last of those who o'er the whole earth reigned,
      The Roman Globe--for, after, none sustained,
      But yielded back his conquests:--he was more
      Than a mere Alexander, and, unstained
      With household blood and wine, serenely wore
    His sovereign virtues--still we Trajan's name adore.

                             CXII.

    Where is the rock of Triumph, the high place
      Where Rome embraced her heroes?--where the steep
      Tarpeian?--fittest goal of Treason's race,
      The Promontory whence the Traitor's Leap
      Cured all ambition? Did the conquerors heap
      Their spoils here? Yes; and in yon field below,
      A thousand years of silenced factions sleep--
      The Forum, where the immortal accents glow,
    And still the eloquent air breathes-burns with Cicero!

                             CXIII.

    The field of Freedom--Faction--Fame--and Blood:
      Here a proud people's passions were exhaled,
      From the first hour of Empire in the bud
      To that when further worlds to conquer failed;
      But long before had Freedom's face been veiled,
      And Anarchy assumed her attributes;
      Till every lawless soldier who assailed
      Trod on the trembling Senate's slavish mutes,
    Or raised the venal voice of baser prostitutes.

                             CXIV.

    Then turn we to her latest Tribune's name,
      From her ten thousand tyrants turn to thee,
      Redeemer of dark centuries of shame--
      The friend of Petrarch--hope of Italy--
      Rienzi! last of Romans! While the tree
      Of Freedom's withered trunk puts forth a leaf,
      Even for thy tomb a garland let it be--
      The Forum's champion, and the people's chief--
    Her new-born Numa thou--with reign, alas! too brief.

                              CXV.

    Egeria! sweet creation of some heart
      Which found no mortal resting-place so fair
      As thine ideal breast; whate'er thou art
      Or wert,--a young Aurora of the air,
      The nympholepsy of some fond despair--
      Or--it might be--a Beauty of the earth,
      Who found a more than common Votary there
      Too much adoring--whatsoe'er thy birth,
    Thou wert a beautiful Thought, and softly bodied forth.

                             CXVI.

    The mosses of thy Fountain still are sprinkled
      With thine Elysian water-drops; the face
      Of thy cave-guarded Spring, with years unwrinkled,
      Reflects the meek-eyed Genius of the place,
      Whose green, wild margin now no more erase
      Art's works; nor must the delicate waters sleep
      Prisoned in marble--bubbling from the base
      Of the cleft statue, with a gentle leap
    The rill runs o'er--and round, fern, flowers, and ivy, creep

                             CXVII.

    Fantastically tangled: the green hills
      Are clothed with early blossoms--through the grass
      The quick-eyed lizard rustles--and the bills
      Of summer-birds sing welcome as ye pass;
      Flowers fresh in hue, and many in their class,
      Implore the pausing step, and with their dyes
      Dance in the soft breeze in a fairy mass;
      The sweetness of the Violet's deep blue eyes,
    Kissed by the breath of heaven, seems coloured by its skies.

                            CXVIII.

    Here didst thou dwell, in this enchanted cover,
      Egeria! thy all heavenly bosom beating
      For the far footsteps of thy mortal lover;
      The purple Midnight veiled that mystic meeting
      With her most starry canopy--and seating
      Thyself by thine adorer, what befel?
      This cave was surely shaped out for the greeting
      Of an enamoured Goddess, and the cell
    Haunted by holy Love--the earliest Oracle!

                             CXIX.

    And didst thou not, thy breast to his replying,
      Blend a celestial with a human heart;
      And Love, which dies as it was born, in sighing,
      Share with immortal transports? could thine art
      Make them indeed immortal, and impart
      The purity of Heaven to earthly joys,
      Expel the venom and not blunt the dart--
      The dull satiety which all destroys--
    And root from out the soul the deadly weed which cloys?

                              CXX.

    Alas! our young affections run to waste,
      Or water but the desert! whence arise
      But weeds of dark luxuriance, tares of haste,
      Rank at the core, though tempting to the eyes
      Flowers whose wild odours breathe but agonies,
      And trees whose gums are poison; such the plants
      Which spring beneath her steps as Passion flies
      O'er the World's wilderness, and vainly pants
    For some celestial fruit forbidden to our wants.

                             CXXI.

    Oh, Love! no habitant of earth thou art--
      An unseen Seraph, we believe in thee,--
      A faith whose martyrs are the broken heart,--
      But never yet hath seen, nor e'er shall see
      The naked eye, thy form, as it should be;
      The mind hath made thee, as it peopled Heaven,
      Even with its own desiring phantasy,
      And to a thought such shape and image given,
    As haunts the unquenched soul--parched--wearied--wrung--and riven.

                             CXXII.

    Of its own beauty is the mind diseased,
      And fevers into false creation:--where,
      Where are the forms the sculptor's soul hath seized?
      In him alone. Can Nature show so fair?
      Where are the charms and virtues which we dare
      Conceive in boyhood and pursue as men,
      The unreached Paradise of our despair,
      Which o'er-informs the pencil and the pen,
    And overpowers the page where it would bloom again?

                            CXXIII.

    Who loves, raves--'tis youth's frenzy--but the cure
      Is bitterer still, as charm by charm unwinds
      Which robed our idols, and we see too sure
      Nor Worth nor Beauty dwells from out the mind's
      Ideal shape of such; yet still it binds
      The fatal spell, and still it draws us on,
      Reaping the whirlwind from the oft-sown winds;
      The stubborn heart, its alchemy begun,
    Seems ever near the prize--wealthiest when most undone.

                             CXXIV.

    We wither from our youth, we gasp away--
      Sick--sick; unfound the boon--unslaked the thirst,
      Though to the last, in verge of our decay,
      Some phantom lures, such as we sought at first--
      But all too late,--so are we doubly curst.
      Love, Fame, Ambition, Avarice--'tis the same,
      Each idle--and all ill--and none the worst--
      For all are meteors with a different name,
    And Death the sable smoke where vanishes the flame.

                             CXXV.

    Few--none--find what they love or could have loved,
      Though accident, blind contact, and the strong
      Necessity of loving, have removed
      Antipathies--but to recur, ere long,
      Envenomed with irrevocable wrong;
      And Circumstance, that unspiritual God
      And Miscreator, makes and helps along
      Our coming evils with a crutch-like rod,
    Whose touch turns Hope to dust,--the dust we all have trod.

                             CXXVI.

    Our life is a false nature--'tis not in
      The harmony of things,--this hard decree,
      This uneradicable taint of Sin,
      This boundless Upas, this all-blasting tree,
      Whose root is Earth--whose leaves and branches be
      The skies which rain their plagues on men like dew--
      Disease, death, bondage--all the woes we see,
      And worse, the woes we see not--which throb through
    The immedicable soul, with heart-aches ever new.

                            CXXVII.

    Yet let us ponder boldly--'tis a base
      Abandonment of reason to resign
      Our right of thought--our last and only place
      Of refuge; this, at least, shall still be mine:
      Though from our birth the Faculty divine
      Is chained and tortured--cabined, cribbed, confined,
      And bred in darkness, lest the Truth should shine
      Too brightly on the unprepared mind,
    The beam pours in--for Time and Skill will couch the blind.

                            CXXVIII.

    Arches on arches! as it were that Rome,
      Collecting the chief trophies of her line,
      Would build up all her triumphs in one dome,
      Her Coliseum stands; the moonbeams shine
      As 'twere its natural torches--for divine
      Should be the light which streams here,--to illume
      This long-explored but still exhaustless mine
      Of Contemplation; and the azure gloom
    Of an Italian night, where the deep skies assume

                             CXXIX.

    Hues which have words, and speak to ye of Heaven,
      Floats o'er this vast and wondrous monument,
      And shadows forth its glory. There is given
      Unto the things of earth, which Time hath bent,
      A Spirit's feeling, and where he hath leant
      His hand, but broke his scythe, there is a power
      And magic in the ruined battlement,
      For which the Palace of the present hour
    Must yield its pomp, and wait till Ages are its dower.

                             CXXX.

    Oh, Time! the Beautifier of the dead,
      Adorner of the ruin--Comforter
      And only Healer when the heart hath bled;
      Time! the Corrector where our judgments err,
      The test of Truth, Love--sole philosopher,
      For all beside are sophists--from thy thrift,
      Which never loses though it doth defer--
      Time, the Avenger! unto thee I lift
    My hands, and eyes, and heart, and crave of thee a gift:

                             CXXXI.

    Amidst this wreck, where thou hast made a shrine
      And temple more divinely desolate--
      Among thy mightier offerings here are mine,
      Ruins of years--though few, yet full of fate:--
      If thou hast ever seen me too elate,
      Hear me not; but if calmly I have borne
      Good, and reserved my pride against the hate
      Which shall not whelm me, let me not have worn
    This iron in my soul in vain--shall they not mourn?

                            CXXXII.

    And Thou, who never yet of human wrong
      Left the unbalanced scale, great Nemesis!
      Here, where the ancient paid thee homage long--
      Thou, who didst call the Furies from the abyss,
      And round Orestes bade them howl and hiss
      For that unnatural retribution--just,
      Had it but been from hands less near--in this
      Thy former realm, I call thee from the dust!
    Dost thou not hear my heart?--Awake! thou shalt, and must.

                            CXXXIII.

    It is not that I may not have incurred,
      For my ancestral faults or mine, the wound
      I bleed withal; and, had it been conferred
      With a just weapon, it had flowed unbound;
      But now my blood shall not sink in the ground--
      To thee I do devote it--Thou shalt take
      The vengeance, which shall yet be sought and found--
      Which if I have not taken for the sake--
    But let that pass--I sleep--but Thou shalt yet awake.

                            CXXXIV.

    And if my voice break forth, 'tis not that now
      I shrink from what is suffered: let him speak
      Who hath beheld decline upon my brow,
      Or seen my mind's convulsion leave it weak;
      But in this page a record will I seek.
      Not in the air shall these my words disperse,
      Though I be ashes; a far hour shall wreak
      The deep prophetic fulness of this verse,
    And pile on human heads the mountain of my curse!

                             CXXXV.

    That curse shall be Forgiveness.--Have I not--
      Hear me, my mother Earth! behold it, Heaven!--
      Have I not had to wrestle with my lot?
      Have I not suffered things to be forgiven?
      Have I not had my brain seared, my heart riven,
      Hopes sapped, name blighted, Life's life lied away?
      And only not to desperation driven,
      Because not altogether of such clay
    As rots into the souls of those whom I survey.

                          CXXXVI.

    From mighty wrongs to petty perfidy
      Have I not seen what human things could do?
      From the loud roar of foaming calumny
      To the small whisper of the as paltry few--
      And subtler venom of the reptile crew,
      The Janus glance of whose significant eye,
      Learning to lie with silence, would seem true--
      And without utterance, save the shrug or sigh,
    Deal round to happy fools its speechless obloquy.

                            CXXXVII.

    But I have lived, and have not lived in vain:
      My mind may lose its force, my blood its fire,
      And my frame perish even in conquering pain;
      But there is that within me which shall tire
      Torture and Time, and breathe when I expire;
      Something unearthly, which they deem not of,
      Like the remembered tone of a mute lyre,
      Shall on their softened spirits sink, and move
    In hearts all rocky now the late remorse of Love.

                           CXXXVIII.

    The seal is set.--Now welcome, thou dread Power!
      Nameless, yet thus omnipotent, which here
      Walk'st in the shadow of the midnight hour
      With a deep awe, yet all distinct from fear;
      Thy haunts are ever where the dead walls rear
      Their ivy mantles, and the solemn scene
      Derives from thee a sense so deep and clear
      That we become a part of what has been,
    And grow upon the spot--all-seeing but unseen.

                            CXXXIX.

    And here the buzz of eager nations ran,
      In murmured pity, or loud-roared applause,
      As man was slaughtered by his fellow man.
      And wherefore slaughtered? wherefore, but because
      Such were the bloody Circus' genial laws,
      And the imperial pleasure.--Wherefore not?
      What matters where we fall to fill the maws
      Of worms--on battle-plains or listed spot?
    Both are but theatres--where the chief actors rot.

                              CXL.

    I see before me the Gladiator lie:
      He leans upon his hand--his manly brow
      Consents to death, but conquers agony,
      And his drooped head sinks gradually low--
      And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow
      From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,
      Like the first of a thunder-shower; and now
      The arena swims around him--he is gone,
    Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the wretch who won.

                             CXLI.

    He heard it, but he heeded not--his eyes
      Were with his heart--and that was far away;
      He recked not of the life he lost nor prize,
      But where his rude hut by the Danube lay--
      There were his young barbarians all at play,
      There was their Dacian mother--he, their sire,
      Butchered to make a Roman holiday--
      All this rushed with his blood--Shall he expire
    And unavenged?--Arise! ye Goths, and glut your ire!

                             CXLII.

    But here, where Murder breathed her bloody steam;--
      And here, where buzzing nations choked the ways,
      And roared or murmured like a mountain stream
      Dashing or winding as its torrent strays;
      Here, where the Roman million's blame or praise
      Was Death or Life--the playthings of a crowd--
      My voice sounds much--and fall the stars' faint rays
      On the arena void--seats crushed--walls bowed--
    And galleries, where my steps seem echoes strangely loud.

                            CXLIII.

    A Ruin--yet what Ruin! from its mass
      Walls--palaces--half-cities, have been reared;
      Yet oft the enormous skeleton ye pass,
      And marvel where the spoil could have appeared.
      Hath it indeed been plundered, or but cleared?
      Alas! developed, opens the decay,
      When the colossal fabric's form is neared:
      It will not bear the brightness of the day,
    Which streams too much on all--years--man--have reft away.

                             CXLIV.

    But when the rising moon begins to climb
      Its topmost arch, and gently pauses there--
      When the stars twinkle through the loops of Time,
      And the low night-breeze waves along the air
      The garland-forest, which the gray walls wear,
      Like laurels on the bald first Caesar's head--
      When the light shines serene but doth not glare--
      Then in this magic circle raise the dead;--
    Heroes have trod this spot--'tis on their dust ye tread.

                             CXLV.

    "While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand:
      When falls the Coliseum, Rome shall fall;
      And when Rome falls--the World." From our own land
      Thus spake the pilgrims o'er this mighty wall
      In Saxon times, which we are wont to call
      Ancient; and these three mortal things are still
      On their foundations, and unaltered all--
      Rome and her Ruin past Redemption's skill--
    The World--the same wide den--of thieves, or what ye will.

                             CXLVI.

    Simple, erect, severe, austere, sublime--
      Shrine of all saints and temple of all Gods,
      From Jove to Jesus--spared and blest by Time--
      Looking tranquillity, while falls or nods
      Arch--empire--each thing round thee--and Man plods
      His way through thorns to ashes--glorious Dome!
      Shalt thou not last? Time's scythe and Tyrants' rods
      Shiver upon thee--sanctuary and home
    Of Art and Piety--Pantheon!--pride of Rome!

                            CXLVII.

    Relic of nobler days, and noblest arts!
      Despoiled yet perfect! with thy circle spreads
      A holiness appealing to all hearts;
      To Art a model--and to him who treads
      Rome for the sake of ages, Glory sheds
      Her light through thy sole aperture; to those
      Who worship, here are altars for their beads--
      And they who feel for Genius may repose
    Their eyes on honoured forms, whose busts around them close.

                            CXLVIII.

    There is a dungeon, in whose dim drear light
      What do I gaze on? Nothing--Look again!
      Two forms are slowly shadowed on my sight--
      Two insulated phantoms of the brain:
      It is not so--I see them full and plain--
      An old man, and a female young and fair,
      Fresh as a nursing mother, in whose vein
      The blood is nectar:--but what doth she there,
    With her unmantled neck, and bosom white and bare?

                             CXLIX.

    Full swells the deep pure fountain of young life,
      Where on the heart and from the heart we took
      Our first and sweetest nurture--when the wife,
      Blest into mother, in the innocent look,
      Or even the piping cry of lips that brook
      No pain and small suspense, a joy perceives
      Man knows not--when from out its cradled nook
      She sees her little bud put forth its leaves--
    What may the fruit be yet?--I know not--Cain was Eve's.

                              CL.

    But here Youth offers to Old Age the food,
      The milk of his own gift: it is her Sire
      To whom she renders back the debt of blood
      Born with her birth:--No--he shall not expire
      While in those warm and lovely veins the fire
      Of health and holy feeling can provide
      Great Nature's Nile, whose deep stream rises higher
      Than Egypt's river:--from that gentle side
    Drink--drink, and live--Old Man! Heaven's realm holds no such tide.

                              CLI.

    The starry fable of the Milky Way
      Has not thy story's purity; it is
      A constellation of a sweeter ray,
      And sacred Nature triumphs more in this
      Reverse of her decree, than in the abyss
      Where sparkle distant worlds:--Oh, holiest Nurse!
      No drop of that clear stream its way shall miss
      To thy Sire's heart, replenishing its source
    With life, as our freed souls rejoin the Universe.

                             CLII.

    Turn to the Mole which Hadrian reared on high,
      Imperial mimic of old Egypt's piles,
      Colossal copyist of deformity--
      Whose travelled phantasy from the far Nile's
      Enormous model, doomed the artist's toils
      To build for Giants, and for his vain earth,
      His shrunken ashes, raise this Dome: How smiles
      The gazer's eye with philosophic mirth,
    To view the huge design which sprung from such a birth!

                          CLIII.

    But lo! the Dome--the vast and wondrous Dome,
      To which Diana's marvel was a cell--
      Christ's mighty shrine above His martyr's tomb!
      I have beheld the Ephesian's miracle--
      Its columns strew the wilderness, and dwell
      The hyaena and the jackal in their shade;
      I have beheld Sophia's bright roofs swell
      Their glittering mass i' the Sun, and have surveyed
    Its sanctuary the while the usurping Moslem prayed;

                             CLIV.

    But thou, of temples old, or altars new,
      Standest alone--with nothing like to thee--
      Worthiest of God, the Holy and the True!
      Since Zion's desolation, when that He
      Forsook his former city, what could be,
      Of earthly structures, in His honour piled,
      Of a sublimer aspect? Majesty--
      Power--Glory--Strength--and Beauty all are aisled
    In this eternal Ark of worship undefiled.

                              CLV.

    Enter: its grandeur overwhelms thee not;
      And why? it is not lessened--but thy mind,
      Expanded by the Genius of the spot,
      Has grown colossal, and can only find
      A fit abode wherein appear enshrined
      Thy hopes of Immortality--and thou
      Shalt one day, if found worthy, so defined
      See thy God face to face, as thou dost now
    His Holy of Holies--nor be blasted by his brow.

                             CLVI.

    Thou movest--but increasing with the advance,
      Like climbing some great Alp, which still doth rise,
      Deceived by its gigantic elegance--
      Vastness which grows, but grows to harmonize--
      All musical in its immensities;
      Rich marbles, richer painting--shrines where flame
      The lamps of gold--and haughty dome which vies
      In air with Earth's chief structures, though their frame
    Sits on the firm-set ground--and this the clouds must claim.

                             CLVII.

    Thou seest not all--but piecemeal thou must break,
      To separate contemplation, the great whole;
      And as the Ocean many bays will make
      That ask the eye--so here condense thy soul
      To more immediate objects, and control
      Thy thoughts until thy mind hath got by heart
      Its eloquent proportions, and unroll
      In mighty graduations, part by part,
    The Glory which at once upon thee did not dart,

                            CLVIII.

    Not by its fault--but thine: Our outward sense
      Is but of gradual grasp--and as it is
      That what we have of feeling most intense
      Outstrips our faint expression; even so this
      Outshining and o'erwhelming edifice
      Fools our fond gaze, and greatest of the great
      Defies at first our Nature's littleness,
      Till, growing with its growth, we thus dilate
    Our Spirits to the size of that they contemplate.

                             CLIX.

    Then pause, and be enlightened; there is more
      In such a survey than the sating gaze
      Of wonder pleased, or awe which would adore
      The worship of the place, or the mere praise
      Of Art and its great Masters, who could raise
      What former time, nor skill, nor thought could plan:
      The fountain of Sublimity displays
      Its depth, and thence may draw the mind of Man
    Its golden sands, and learn what great Conceptions can.

                              CLX.

    Or, turning to the Vatican, go see
      Laocoon's torture dignifying pain--
      A Father's love and Mortal's agony
      With an Immortal's patience blending:--Vain
      The struggle--vain, against the coiling strain
      And gripe, and deepening of the dragon's grasp,
      The Old Man's clench; the long envenomed chain
      Rivets the living links,--the enormous Asp
    Enforces pang on pang, and stifles gasp on gasp.

                             CLXI.

    Or view the Lord of the unerring bow,
      The God of Life, and Poesy, and Light--
      The Sun in human limbs arrayed, and brow
      All radiant from his triumph in the fight;
      The shaft hath just been shot--the arrow bright
      With an Immortal's vengeance--in his eye
      And nostril beautiful Disdain, and Might
      And Majesty, flash their full lightnings by,
    Developing in that one glance the Deity.

                             CLXII.

    But in his delicate form--a dream of Love,
      Shaped by some solitary Nymph, whose breast
      Longed for a deathless lover from above,
      And maddened in that vision--are exprest
      All that ideal Beauty ever blessed
      The mind with in its most unearthly mood,
      When each Conception was a heavenly Guest--
      A ray of Immortality--and stood,
    Starlike, around, until they gathered to a God!

                            CLXIII.

    And if it be Prometheus stole from Heaven
      The fire which we endure--it was repaid
      By him to whom the energy was given
      Which this poetic marble hath arrayed
      With an eternal Glory--which, if made
      By human hands, is not of human thought--
      And Time himself hath hallowed it, nor laid
      One ringlet in the dust--nor hath it caught
    A tinge of years, but breathes the flame with which 'twas wrought.

                             CLXIV.

    But where is he, the Pilgrim of my Song,
      The Being who upheld it through the past?
      Methinks he cometh late and tarries long.
      He is no more--these breathings are his last--
      His wanderings done--his visions ebbing fast,
      And he himself as nothing:--if he was
      Aught but a phantasy, and could be classed
      With forms which live and suffer--let that pass--
    His shadow fades away into Destruction's mass,

                             CLXV.

    Which gathers shadow--substance--life, and all
      That we inherit in its mortal shroud--
      And spreads the dim and universal pall
      Through which all things grow phantoms; and the cloud
      Between us sinks and all which ever glowed,
      Till Glory's self is twilight, and displays
      A melancholy halo scarce allowed
      To hover on the verge of darkness--rays
    Sadder than saddest night, for they distract the gaze,

                             CLXVI.

    And send us prying into the abyss,
      To gather what we shall be when the frame
      Shall be resolved to something less than this--
      Its wretched essence; and to dream of fame,
      And wipe the dust from off the idle name
      We never more shall hear,--but never more,
      Oh, happier thought! can we be made the same:--
      It is enough in sooth that once we bore
    These fardels of the heart--the heart whose sweat was gore.

                            CLXVII.

    Hark! forth from the abyss a voice proceeds,
      A long low distant murmur of dread sound,
      Such as arises when a nation bleeds
      With some deep and immedicable wound;--
      Through storm and darkness yawns the rending ground--
      The gulf is thick with phantoms, but the Chief
      Seems royal still, though with her head discrowned,
      And pale, but lovely, with maternal grief--
    She clasps a babe, to whom her breast yields no relief.

                            CLXVIII.

    Scion of Chiefs and Monarchs, where art thou?
      Fond Hope of many nations, art thou dead?
      Could not the Grave forget thee, and lay low
      Some less majestic, less beloved head?
      In the sad midnight, while thy heart still bled,
      The mother of a moment, o'er thy boy,
      Death hushed that pang for ever: with thee fled
      The present happiness and promised joy
    Which filled the Imperial Isles so full it seemed to cloy.

                             CLXIX.

    Peasants bring forth in safety.--Can it be,
      Oh thou that wert so happy, so adored!
      Those who weep not for Kings shall weep for thee,
      And Freedom's heart, grown heavy, cease to hoard
      Her many griefs for One; for she had poured
      Her orisons for thee, and o'er thy head
      Beheld her Iris.--Thou, too, lonely Lord,
      And desolate Consort--vainly wert thou wed!
    The husband of a year! the father of the dead!

                             CLXX.

    Of sackcloth was thy wedding garment made;
      Thy bridal's fruit is ashes: in the dust
      The fair-haired Daughter of the Isles is laid,
      The love of millions! How we did entrust
      Futurity to her! and, though it must
      Darken above our bones, yet fondly deemed
      Our children should obey her child, and blessed
      Her and her hoped-for seed, whose promise seemed
    Like stars to shepherd's eyes:--'twas but a meteor beamed.

                             CLXXI.

    Woe unto us--not her--for she sleeps well:
      The fickle reek of popular breath, the tongue
      Of hollow counsel, the false oracle,
      Which from the birth of Monarchy hath rung
      Its knell in princely ears, till the o'erstung
      Nations have armed in madness--the strange fate
      Which tumbles mightiest sovereigns, and hath flung
      Against their blind omnipotence a weight
    Within the opposing scale, which crushes soon or late,--

                            CLXXII.

    These might have been her destiny--but no--
      Our hearts deny it: and so young, so fair,
      Good without effort, great without a foe;
      But now a Bride and Mother--and now there!
      How many ties did that stern moment tear!
      From thy Sire's to his humblest subject's breast
      Is linked the electric chain of that despair,
      Whose shock was as an Earthquake's, and opprest
    The land which loved thee so that none could love thee best.

                            CLXXIII.

    Lo, Nemi! navelled in the woody hills
      So far, that the uprooting Wind which tears
      The oak from his foundation, and which spills
      The Ocean o'er its boundary, and bears
      Its foam against the skies, reluctant spares
      The oval mirror of thy glassy lake;
      And calm as cherished hate, its surface wears
      A deep cold settled aspect nought can shake,
    All coiled into itself and round, as sleeps the snake.

                            CLXXIV.

    And near, Albano's scarce divided waves
      Shine from a sister valley;--and afar
      The Tiber winds, and the broad Ocean laves
      The Latian coast where sprung the Epic war,
      "Arms and the Man," whose re-ascending star
      Rose o'er an empire:--but beneath thy right
      Tully reposed from Rome;--and where yon bar
      Of girdling mountains intercepts the sight
    The Sabine farm was tilled, the weary Bard's delight.

                             CLXXV.

    But I forget.--My Pilgrim's shrine is won,
      And he and I must part,--so let it be,--
      His task and mine alike are nearly done;
      Yet once more let us look upon the Sea;
      The Midland Ocean breaks on him and me,
      And from the Alban Mount we now behold
      Our friend of youth, that Ocean, which when we
      Beheld it last by Calpe's rock unfold
    Those waves, we followed on till the dark Euxine rolled

                            CLXXVI.

    Upon the blue Symplegades: long years--
      Long, though not very many--since have done
      Their work on both; some suffering and some tears
      Have left us nearly where we had begun:
      Yet not in vain our mortal race hath run--
      We have had our reward--and it is here,--
      That we can yet feel gladdened by the Sun,
      And reap from Earth--Sea--joy almost as dear
    As if there were no Man to trouble what is clear.

                            CLXXVII.

    Oh! that the Desert were my dwelling-place,
      With one fair Spirit for my minister,
      That I might all forget the human race,
      And, hating no one, love but only her!
      Ye elements!--in whose ennobling stir
      I feel myself exalted--Can ye not
      Accord me such a Being? Do I err
      In deeming such inhabit many a spot?
    Though with them to converse can rarely be our lot.

                           CLXXVIII.

    There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
      There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
      There is society, where none intrudes,
      By the deep Sea, and Music in its roar:
      I love not Man the less, but Nature more,
      From these our interviews, in which I steal
      From all I may be, or have been before,
      To mingle with the Universe, and feel
    What I can ne'er express--yet can not all conceal.

                            CLXXIX.

    Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll!
      Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;
      Man marks the earth with ruin--his control
      Stops with the shore;--upon the watery plain
      The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain
      A shadow of man's ravage, save his own,
      When, for a moment, like a drop of rain,
      He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan--
    Without a grave--unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.

                             CLXXX.

    His steps are not upon thy paths,--thy fields
      Are not a spoil for him,--thou dost arise
      And shake him from thee; the vile strength he wields
      For Earth's destruction thou dost all despise,
      Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies--
      And send'st him, shivering in thy playful spray
      And howling, to his Gods, where haply lies
      His petty hope in some near port or bay,
    And dashest him again to Earth:--there let him lay.

                            CLXXXI.

    The armaments which thunderstrike the walls
      Of rock-built cities, bidding nations quake,
      And Monarchs tremble in their Capitals,
      The oak Leviathans, whose huge ribs make
      Their clay creator the vain title take
      Of Lord of thee, and Arbiter of War--
      These are thy toys, and, as the snowy flake,
      They melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar
    Alike the Armada's pride or spoils of Trafalgar.

                            CLXXXII.

    Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee--
      Assyria--Greece--Rome--Carthage--what are they?
      Thy waters washed them power while they were free,
      And many a tyrant since; their shores obey
      The stranger, slave, or savage; their decay
      Has dried up realms to deserts:--not so thou,
      Unchangeable save to thy wild waves' play,
      Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow--
    Such as Creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now.

                           CLXXXIII.

    Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty's form
      Glasses itself in tempests; in all time,
      Calm or convulsed--in breeze, or gale, or storm--
      Icing the Pole, or in the torrid clime
      Dark-heaving--boundless, endless, and sublime--
      The image of Eternity-the throne
      Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime
      The monsters of the deep are made--each Zone
    Obeys thee--thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone.

                            CLXXXIV.

    And I have loved thee, Ocean! and my joy
      Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be
      Borne, like thy bubbles, onward: from a boy
      I wantoned with thy breakers--they to me
      Were a delight; and if the freshening sea
      Made them a terror--'twas a pleasing fear,
      For I was as it were a Child of thee,
      And trusted to thy billows far and near,
    And laid my hand upon thy mane--as I do here.

                            CLXXXV.

    My task is done--my song hath ceased--my theme
      Has died into an echo; it is fit
      The spell should break of this protracted dream.
      The torch shall be extinguished which hath lit
      My midnight lamp--and what is writ, is writ,--
      Would it were worthier! but I am not now
      That which I have been--and my visions flit
      Less palpably before me--and the glow
    Which in my Spirit dwelt is fluttering, faint, and low.

                            CLXXXVI.

    Farewell! a word that must be, and hath been--
      A sound which makes us linger;--yet--farewell!
      Ye! who have traced the Pilgrim to the scene
      Which is his last--if in your memories dwell
      A thought which once was his--if on ye swell
      A single recollection--not in vain
      He wore his sandal-shoon, and scallop-shell;
      Farewell! with him alone may rest the pain,
    If such there were--with you, the Moral of his Strain.

                    THE GIRL OF CADIZ.

                    1.

    Oh never talk again to me
      Of northern climes and British ladies;
    It has not been your lot to see,
      Like me, the lovely Girl of Cadiz.
    Although her eye be not of blue,
      Nor fair her locks, like English lasses,
    How far its own expressive hue
      The languid azure eye surpasses!

                    2.

    Prometheus-like from heaven she stole
      The fire that through those silken lashes
    In darkest glances seems to roll,
      From eyes that cannot hide their flashes:
    And as along her bosom steal
      In lengthened flow her raven tresses,
    You'd swear each clustering lock could feel,
      And curled to give her neck caresses.

                    3.

    Our English maids are long to woo,
      And frigid even in possession;
    And if their charms be fair to view,
      Their lips are slow at Love's confession;
    But, born beneath a brighter sun,
      For love ordained the Spanish maid is,
    And who,--when fondly, fairly won,--
      Enchants you like the Girl of Cadiz?

                    4.

    The Spanish maid is no coquette,
      Nor joys to see a lover tremble,
    And if she love, or if she hate,
      Alike she knows not to dissemble.
    Her heart can ne'er be bought or sold--
      Howe'er it beats, it beats sincerely;
    And, though it will not bend to gold,
      'Twill love you long and love you dearly.

                    5.

    The Spanish girl that meets your love
      Ne'er taunts you with a mock denial,
    For every thought is bent to prove
      Her passion in the hour of trial.
    When thronging foemen menace Spain,
      She dares the deed and shares the danger;
    And should her lover press the plain,
      She hurls the spear, her love's avenger.

                    6.

    And when, beneath the evening star,
      She mingles in the gay Bolero,
    Or sings to her attuned guitar
      Of Christian knight or Moorish hero,
    Or counts her beads with fairy hand
      Beneath the twinkling rays of Hesper,
    Or joins Devotion's choral band,
      To chaunt the sweet and hallowed vesper;--

                    7.

    In each her charms the heart must move
      Of all who venture to behold her;
    Then let not maids less fair reprove
      Because her bosom is not colder:
    Through many a clime 'tis mine to roam
      Where many a soft and melting maid is,
    But none abroad, and few at home,
      May match the dark-eyed Girl of Cadiz.
                                                            
        LINES WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM, AT MALTA.

                    1.

    As o'er the cold sepulchral stone
      Some name arrests the passer-by;
    Thus, when thou view'st this page alone,
      May mine attract thy pensive eye!

                    2.

    And when by thee that name is read,
      Perchance in some succeeding year,
    Reflect on me as on the dead,
      And think my Heart is buried here.
                                            
                     TO FLORENCE.

                    1.

    Oh Lady! when I left the shore,
      The distant shore which gave me birth,
    I hardly thought to grieve once more,
      To quit another spot on earth:

                    2.

    Yet here, amidst this barren isle,
      Where panting Nature droops the head,
    Where only thou art seen to smile,
      I view my parting hour with dread.

                    3.

    Though far from Albin's craggy shore,
      Divided by the dark-blue main;
    A few, brief, rolling seasons o'er,
      Perchance I view her cliffs again:

                    4.

    But wheresoe'er I now may roam,
      Through scorching clime, and varied sea,
    Though Time restore me to my home,
      I ne'er shall bend mine eyes on thee:

                    5.

    On thee, in whom at once conspire
      All charms which heedless hearts can move,
    Whom but to see is to admire,
      And, oh! forgive the word--to love.

                    6.

    Forgive the word, in one who ne'er
      With such a word can more offend;
    And since thy heart I cannot share,
      Believe me, what I am, thy friend.

                    7.

    And who so cold as look on thee,
      Thou lovely wand'rer, and be less?
    Nor be, what man should ever be,
      The friend of Beauty in distress?

                    8.

    Ah! who would think that form had past
      Through Danger's most destructive path,
    Had braved the death-winged tempest's blast,
      And 'scaped a Tyrant's fiercer wrath?

                    9.

    Lady! when I shall view the walls
      Where free Byzantium once arose,
    And Stamboul's Oriental halls
      The Turkish tyrants now enclose;

                    10.

    Though mightiest in the lists of fame,
      That glorious city still shall be;
    On me 'twill hold a dearer claim,
      As spot of thy nativity:

                    11.

    And though I bid thee now farewell,
      When I behold that wondrous scene--
    Since where thou art I may not dwell--
      'Twill soothe to be where thou hast been.
                                                       
        STANZAS COMPOSED DURING A THUNDERSTORM.

                    1.

    Chill and mirk is the nightly blast,
      Where Pindus' mountains rise,
    And angry clouds are pouring fast
      The vengeance of the skies.

                    2.

    Our guides are gone, our hope is lost,
      And lightnings, as they play,
    But show where rocks our path have crost,
      Or gild the torrent's spray.

                    3.

    Is yon a cot I saw, though low?
      When lightning broke the gloom--
    How welcome were its shade!--ah, no!
      'Tis but a Turkish tomb.

                    4.

    Through sounds of foaming waterfalls,
      I hear a voice exclaim--
    My way-worn countryman, who calls
      On distant England's name.

                    5.

    A shot is fired--by foe or friend?
      Another--'tis to tell
    The mountain-peasants to descend,
      And lead us where they dwell.

                    6.

    Oh! who in such a night will dare
      To tempt the wilderness?
    And who 'mid thunder-peals can hear
      Our signal of distress?

                    7.

    And who that heard our shouts would rise
      To try the dubious road?
    Nor rather deem from nightly cries
      That outlaws were abroad.

                    8.

    Clouds burst, skies flash, oh, dreadful hour!
      More fiercely pours the storm!
    Yet here one thought has still the power
      To keep my bosom warm.

                    9.

    While wandering through each broken path,
      O'er brake and craggy brow;
    While elements exhaust their wrath,
      Sweet Florence, where art thou?

                    10.

    Not on the sea, not on the sea--
      Thy bark hath long been gone:
    Oh, may the storm that pours on me,
      Bow down my head alone!

                    11.

    Full swiftly blew the swift Siroc,
      When last I pressed thy lip;
    And long ere now, with foaming shock,
      Impelled thy gallant ship.

                    12.

    Now thou art safe; nay, long ere now
      Hast trod the shore of Spain;
    'Twere hard if aught so fair as thou
      Should linger on the main.

                    13.

    And since I now remember thee
      In darkness and in dread,
    As in those hours of revelry
      Which Mirth and Music sped;

                    14.

    Do thou, amid the fair white walls,
      If Cadiz yet be free,
    At times from out her latticed halls
      Look o'er the dark blue sea;

                    15.

    Then think upon Calypso's isles,
      Endeared by days gone by;
    To others give a thousand smiles,
      To me a single sigh.

                    16.

    And when the admiring circle mark
      The paleness of thy face,
    A half-formed tear, a transient spark
      Of melancholy grace,

                    17.

    Again thou'lt smile, and blushing shun
      Some coxcomb's raillery;
    Nor own for once thou thought'st on one,
      Who ever thinks on thee.

                    18.

    Though smile and sigh alike are vain,
      When severed hearts repine,
    My spirit flies o'er Mount and Main,
      And mourns in search of thine.

    Through cloudless skies, in silvery sheen,
      Full beams the moon on Actium's coast:
    And on these waves, for Egypt's queen,
      The ancient world was won and lost.

                    2.

    And now upon the scene I look,

    Where stern Ambition once forsook
      His wavering crown to follow Woman.

    Florence! whom I will love as well
      (As ever yet was said or sung,
    Since Orpheus sang his spouse from Hell)
      Whilst thou art fair and I am young;

                    4.

    Sweet Florence! those were pleasant times,
      When worlds were staked for Ladies' eyes:
    Had bards as many realms as rhymes,
      Thy charms might raise new Antonies.

                    5.

    Though Fate forbids such things to be,
      Yet, by thine eyes and ringlets curled!
    I cannot lose a world for thee,
      But would not lose thee for a World.

    The spell is broke, the charm is flown!
      Thus is it with Life's fitful fever:
    We madly smile when we should groan;
      Delirium is our best deceiver.
    Each lucid interval of thought
      Recalls the woes of Nature's charter;
    And He that acts as wise men ought,
      But lives--as Saints have died--a martyr.

    He comes to Athens, and he--writes his name."

       With lowering port majestic Athos stands,
    Crowned with the verdure of eternal wood,

    Where air and sea with rocks and woods conspire

    Along the rocky shore proclaim it holy ground.

    Who saved ye once from falling,
      The terrible! the strong!
    Who made that bold diversion
      In old ThermopylÃ¦,
    And warring with the Persian
      To keep his country free;
    With his three hundred waging
      The battle, long he stood,
    And like a lion raging,
      Expired in seas of blood.

              TRANSLATION OF THE ROMAIC SONG,

    I enter thy garden of roses,
      Beloved and fair Haidee,
    Each morning where Flora reposes,
      For surely I see her in thee.
    Oh, Lovely! thus low I implore thee,
      Receive this fond truth from my tongue,
    Which utters its song to adore thee,
      Yet trembles for what it has sung;
    As the branch, at the bidding of Nature,
      Adds fragrance and fruit to the tree,
    Through her eyes, through her every feature,
      Shines the soul of the young Haidee.

    But the loveliest garden grows hateful
      When Love has abandoned the bowers;
    Bring me hemlock--since mine is ungrateful,
      That herb is more fragrant than flowers.
    The poison, when poured from the chalice,
      Will deeply embitter the bowl;
    But when drunk to escape from thy malice,
      The draught shall be sweet to my soul.
    Too cruel! in vain I implore thee
      My heart from these horrors to save:
    Will nought to my bosom restore thee?
      Then open the gates of the grave.

    As the chief who to combat advances
      Secure of his conquest before,
    Thus thou, with those eyes for thy lances,
      Hast pierced through my heart to its core.
    Ah, tell me, my soul! must I perish
      By pangs which a smile would dispel?
    Would the hope, which thou once bad'st me cherish,
      For torture repay me too well?
    Now sad is the garden of roses,
      Beloved but false Haidee!
    There Flora all withered reposes,
      And mourns o'er thine absence with me.
                                                               
                        ON PARTING.

                    1.

    The kiss, dear maid! thy lip has left
      Shall never part from mine,
    Till happier hours restore the gift
      Untainted back to thine.

                    2.

    Thy parting glance, which fondly beams,
      An equal love may see:
    The tear that from thine eyelid streams
      Can weep no change in me.

                    3.

    I ask no pledge to make me blest
      In gazing when alone;
    Nor one memorial for a breast,
      Whose thoughts are all thine own.

                    4.

    Nor need I write--to tell the tale
      My pen were doubly weak:
    Oh! what can idle words avail,
      Unless the heart could speak?

                    5.

    By day or night, in weal or woe,
      That heart, no longer free,
    Must bear the love it cannot show,
      And silent ache for thee.
                                                          
                   FAREWELL TO MALTA.

    Adieu, ye joys of La Valette!
    Adieu, Sirocco, sun, and sweat!
    Adieu, thou palace rarely entered!
    Adieu, ye mansions where--I've ventured!
    Adieu, ye cursed streets of stairs!
    (How surely he who mounts them swears!)
    Adieu, ye merchants often failing!
    Adieu, thou mob for ever railing!
    Adieu, ye packets--without letters!
    Adieu, ye fools--who ape your betters!
    Adieu, thou damned'st quarantine,
    That gave me fever, and the spleen!
    Adieu that stage which makes us yawn, Sirs,
    Adieu his Excellency's dancers!
    Adieu to Peter--whom no fault's in,
    But could not teach a colonel waltzing;
    Adieu, ye females fraught with graces!
    Adieu red coats, and redder faces!
    Adieu the supercilious air
    Of all that strut en militaire!
    I go--but God knows when, or why,
    To smoky towns and cloudy sky,
    To things (the honest truth to say)
    As bad--but in a different way.

    Farewell to these, but not adieu,
    Triumphant sons of truest blue!
    While either Adriatic shore,
    And fallen chiefs, and fleets no more,
    And nightly smiles, and daily dinners,
    Proclaim you war and women's winners.
    Pardon my Muse, who apt to prate is,
    And take my rhyme--because 'tis "gratis."

    And now I've got to Mrs. Fraser,
    Perhaps you think I mean to praise her--
    And were I vain enough to think
    My praise was worth this drop of ink,
    A line--or two--were no hard matter,
    As here, indeed, I need not flatter:
    But she must be content to shine
    In better praises than in mine,
    With lively air, and open heart,
    And fashion's ease, without its art;
    Her hours can gaily glide along.
    Nor ask the aid of idle song.

    And now, O Malta! since thou'st got us,
    Thou little military hot-house!
    I'll not offend with words uncivil,
    And wish thee rudely at the Devil,
    But only stare from out my casement,
    And ask, "for what is such a place meant?"
    Then, in my solitary nook,
    Return to scribbling, or a book,
    Or take my physic while I'm able
    (Two spoonfuls hourly, by this label),
    Prefer my nightcap to my beaver,
    And bless my stars I've got a fever.
                                                    
                      NEWSTEAD ABBEY.

                    1.

    In the dome of my Sires as the clear moonbeam falls
    Through Silence and Shade o'er its desolate walls,
    It shines from afar like the glories of old;
    It gilds, but it warms not--'tis dazzling, but cold.

                    2.

    Let the Sunbeam be bright for the younger of days:
    'Tis the light that should shine on a race that decays,
    When the Stars are on high and the dews on the ground,
    And the long shadow lingers the ruin around.

                    3.

    And the step that o'erechoes the gray floor of stone
    Falls sullenly now, for 'tis only my own;
    And sunk are the voices that sounded in mirth,
    And empty the goblet, and dreary the hearth.

                    4.

    And vain was each effort to raise and recall
    The brightness of old to illumine our Hall;
    And vain was the hope to avert our decline,
    And the fate of my fathers had faded to mine.

                    5.

    And theirs was the wealth and the fulness of Fame,
    And mine to inherit too haughty a name;
    And theirs were the times and the triumphs of yore,
    And mine to regret, but renew them no more.

                    6.

    And Ruin is fixed on my tower and my wall,
    Too hoary to fade, and too massy to fall;
    It tells not of Time's or the tempest's decay,
    But the wreck of the line that have held it in sway.
                                                       
                  EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,

        IN ANSWER TO SOME LINES EXHORTING THE AUTHOR
           TO BE CHEERFUL, AND TO "BANISH CARE."

    "Oh! banish care"--such ever be
    The motto of thy revelry!
    Perchance of mine, when wassail nights
    Renew those riotous delights,
    Wherewith the children of Despair
    Lull the lone heart, and "banish care."
    But not in Morn's reflecting hour,
    When present, past, and future lower,
    When all I loved is changed or gone,
    Mock with such taunts the woes of one,
    Whose every thought--but let them pass--
    Thou know'st I am not what I was.
    But, above all, if thou wouldst hold
    Place in a heart that ne'er was cold,
    By all the powers that men revere,
    By all unto thy bosom dear,
    Thy joys below, thy hopes above,
    Speak--speak of anything but Love.

      'Twere long to tell, and vain to hear,
    The tale of one who scorns a tear;
    And there is little in that tale
    Which better bosoms would bewail.
    But mine has suffered more than well
    'Twould suit philosophy to tell.
    I've seen my bride another's bride,--
    Have seen her seated by his side,--
    Have seen the infant, which she bore,
    Wear the sweet smile the mother wore,
    When she and I in youth have smiled,
    As fond and faultless as her child;--
    Have seen her eyes, in cold disdain,
    Ask if I felt no secret pain;
    And I have acted well my part,
    And made my cheek belie my heart,
    Returned the freezing glance she gave,
    Yet felt the while that woman's slave;--
    Have kissed, as if without design,
    The babe which ought to have been mine,
    And showed, alas! in each caress
    Time had not made me love the less.

      But let this pass--I'll whine no more,
    Nor seek again an eastern shore;
    The world befits a busy brain,--
    I'll hie me to its haunts again.
    But if, in some succeeding year,
    When Britain's "May is in the sere,"
    Thou hear'st of one, whose deepening crimes
    Suit with the sablest of the times,
    Of one, whom love nor pity sways,
    Nor hope of fame, nor good men's praise;
    One, who in stern Ambition's pride,
    Perchance not blood shall turn aside;
    One ranked in some recording page
    With the worst anarchs of the age,
    Him wilt thou know--and knowing pause,
    Nor with the effect forget the cause.
                                    
                     TO THYRZA.

    Without a stone to mark the spot,
      And say, what Truth might well have said,
    By all, save one, perchance forgot,
      Ah! wherefore art thou lowly laid?
    By many a shore and many a sea
      Divided, yet beloved in vain;
    The Past, the Future fled to thee,
      To bid us meet--no--ne'er again!
    Could this have been--a word, a look,
      That softly said, "We part in peace,"
    Had taught my bosom how to brook,
      With fainter sighs, thy soul's release.
    And didst thou not, since Death for thee
      Prepared a light and pangless dart,
    Once long for him thou ne'er shalt see,
      Who held, and holds thee in his heart?
    Oh! who like him had watched thee here?
      Or sadly marked thy glazing eye,
    In that dread hour ere Death appear,
      When silent Sorrow fears to sigh,
    Till all was past? But when no more
      'Twas thine to reck of human woe,
    Affection's heart-drops, gushing o'er,
      Had flowed as fast--as now they flow.
    Shall they not flow, when many a day
      In these, to me, deserted towers,
    Ere called but for a time away,
      Affection's mingling tears were ours?
    Ours too the glance none saw beside;
      The smile none else might understand;
    The whispered thought of hearts allied,
      The pressure of the thrilling hand;
    The kiss, so guiltless and refined,
      That Love each warmer wish forbore;
    Those eyes proclaimed so pure a mind,
      Ev'n Passion blushed to plead for more.
    The tone, that taught me to rejoice,
      When prone, unlike thee, to repine;
    The song, celestial from thy voice,
      But sweet to me from none but thine;
    The pledge we wore--I wear it still,
      But where is thine?--Ah! where art thou?
    Oft have I borne the weight of ill,
      But never bent beneath till now!
    Well hast thou left in Life's best bloom
      The cup of Woe for me to drain.
    If rest alone be in the tomb,
      I would not wish thee here again:
    But if in worlds more blest than this
      Thy virtues seek a fitter sphere,
    Impart some portion of thy bliss,
      To wean me from mine anguish here.
    Teach me--too early taught by thee!
      To bear, forgiving and forgiven:
    On earth thy love was such to me;
      It fain would form my hope in Heaven!
                                                        
            AWAY, AWAY, YE NOTES OF WOE!

                    1.

    Away, away, ye notes of Woe!
      Be silent, thou once soothing Strain,
    Or I must flee from hence--for, oh!
      I dare not trust those sounds again.
    To me they speak of brighter days--
      But lull the chords, for now, alas!
    I must not think, I may not gaze,
      On what I am--on what I was.

                    2.

    The voice that made those sounds more sweet
      Is hushed, and all their charms are fled;
    And now their softest notes repeat
      A dirge, an anthem o'er the dead!
    Yes, Thyrza! yes, they breathe of thee,
      Beloved dust! since dust thou art;
    And all that once was Harmony
      Is worse than discord to my heart!

                    3.

    'Tis silent all!--but on my ear
      The well remembered Echoes thrill;
    I hear a voice I would not hear,
      A voice that now might well be still:
    Yet oft my doubting Soul 'twill shake;
      Ev'n Slumber owns its gentle tone,
    Till Consciousness will vainly wake
      To listen, though the dream be flown.

                    4.

    Sweet Thyrza! waking as in sleep,
      Thou art but now a lovely dream;
    A Star that trembled o'er the deep,
      Then turned from earth its tender beam.
    But he who through Life's dreary way
      Must pass, when Heaven is veiled in wrath,
    Will long lament the vanished ray
      That scattered gladness o'er his path.
                                                      
           ONE STRUGGLE MORE, AND I AM FREE.

                    1.

    One struggle more, and I am free
      From pangs that rend my heart in twain;
    One last long sigh to Love and thee,
      Then back to busy life again.
    It suits me well to mingle now
      With things that never pleased before:
    Though every joy is fled below,
      What future grief can touch me more?

                    2.

    Then bring me wine, the banquet bring;
      Man was not formed to live alone:
    I'll be that light unmeaning thing
      That smiles with all, and weeps with none.
    It was not thus in days more dear,
      It never would have been, but thou
    Hast fled, and left me lonely here;
      Thou'rt nothing,--all are nothing now.

                    3.

    In vain my lyre would lightly breathe!
      The smile that Sorrow fain would wear
    But mocks the woe that lurks beneath,
      Like roses o'er a sepulchre.
    Though gay companions o'er the bowl
      Dispel awhile the sense of ill;
    Though Pleasure fires the maddening soul,
      The Heart,--the Heart is lonely still!

                    4.

    On many a lone and lovely night
      It soothed to gaze upon the sky;
    For then I deemed the heavenly light
      Shone sweetly on thy pensive eye:
    And oft I thought at Cynthia's noon,
      When sailing o'er the Aegean wave,
    "Now Thyrza gazes on that moon"--
      Alas, it gleamed upon her grave!

                    5.

    When stretched on Fever's sleepless bed,
      And sickness shrunk my throbbing veins,
    "'Tis comfort still," I faintly said,
      "That Thyrza cannot know my pains:"
    Like freedom to the time-worn slave--
      A boon 'tis idle then to give--
    Relenting Nature vainly gave
      My life, when Thyrza ceased to live!

                    6.

    My Thyrza's pledge in better days,
      When Love and Life alike were new!
    How different now thou meet'st my gaze!
      How tinged by time with Sorrow's hue!
    The heart that gave itself with thee
      Is silent--ah, were mine as still!
    Though cold as e'en the dead can be,
      It feels, it sickens with the chill.

                    7.

    Thou bitter pledge! thou mournful token!
      Though painful, welcome to my breast!
    Still, still, preserve that love unbroken,
      Or break the heart to which thou'rt pressed.
    Time tempers Love, but not removes,
      More hallowed when its Hope is fled:
    Oh! what are thousand living loves
      To that which cannot quit the dead?

                        EUTHANASIA.

                    1.

    When Time, or soon or late, shall bring
      The dreamless sleep that lulls the dead,
    Oblivion! may thy languid wing
      Wave gently o'er my dying bed!

                    2.

    No band of friends or heirs be there,
      To weep, or wish, the coming blow:
    No maiden, with dishevelled hair,
      To feel, or feign, decorous woe.

                    3.

    But silent let me sink to Earth,
      With no officious mourners near:
    I would not mar one hour of mirth,
      Nor startle Friendship with a fear.

                    4.

    Yet Love, if Love in such an hour
      Could nobly check its useless sighs,
    Might then exert its latest power
      In her who lives, and him who dies.

                    5.

    'Twere sweet, my Psyche! to the last
      Thy features still serene to see:
    Forgetful of its struggles past,
      E'en Pain itself should smile on thee.

                    6.

    But vain the wish--for Beauty still
      Will shrink, as shrinks the ebbing breath;
    And Woman's tears, produced at will,
      Deceive in life, unman in death.

                    7.

    Then lonely be my latest hour,
      Without regret, without a groan;
    For thousands Death hath ceased to lower,
      And pain been transient or unknown.

                    8.

    "Aye but to die, and go," alas!
      Where all have gone, and all must go!
    To be the nothing that I was
      Ere born to life and living woe!

                    9.

    Count o'er the joys thine hours have seen,
      Count o'er thy days from anguish free,
    And know, whatever thou hast been,
      'Tis something better not to be.
            
         AND THOU ART DEAD, AS YOUNG AND FAIR.

"Heu, quanto minus est cum reliquis versari quam tui meminisse!"

                    1.

    And thou art dead, as young and fair
      As aught of mortal birth;
    And form so soft, and charms so rare,
      Too soon returned to Earth!
    Though Earth received them in her bed,
    And o'er the spot the crowd may tread
      In carelessness or mirth,
    There is an eye which could not brook
    A moment on that grave to look.

                    2.

    I will not ask where thou liest low,
      Nor gaze upon the spot;
    There flowers or weeds at will may grow,
      So I behold them not:
    It is enough for me to prove
    That what I loved, and long must love,
      Like common earth can rot;
    To me there needs no stone to tell,
    'Tis Nothing that I loved so well

                    3.

    Yet did I love thee to the last
      As fervently as thou,
    Who didst not change through all the past,
      And canst not alter now.
    The love where Death has set his seal,
    Nor age can chill, nor rival steal,
      Nor falsehood disavow:
    And, what were worse, thou canst not see
    Or wrong, or change, or fault in me.

                    4.

    The better days of life were ours;
      The worst can be but mine:
    The sun that cheers, the storm that lowers,
      Shall never more be thine.
    The silence of that dreamless sleep
    I envy now too much to weep;
      Nor need I to repine,
    That all those charms have passed away
    I might have watched through long decay.

                    5.

    The flower in ripened bloom unmatched
      Must fall the earliest prey;
    Though by no hand untimely snatched,
      The leaves must drop away:
    And yet it were a greater grief
    To watch it withering, leaf by leaf,
      Than see it plucked to-day;
    Since earthly eye but ill can bear
    To trace the change to foul from fair.

                    6.

    I know not if I could have borne
      To see thy beauties fade;
    The night that followed such a morn
      Had worn a deeper shade:
    Thy day without a cloud hath passed,
    And thou wert lovely to the last;
      Extinguished, not decayed;
    As stars that shoot along the sky
    Shine brightest as they fall from high.

                    7.

    As once I wept, if I could weep,
      My tears might well be shed,
    To think I was not near to keep
      One vigil o'er thy bed;
    To gaze, how fondly! on thy face,
    To fold thee in a faint embrace,
      Uphold thy drooping head;
    And show that love, however vain,
    Nor thou nor I can feel again.

                    8.

    Yet how much less it were to gain,
      Though thou hast left me free,
    The loveliest things that still remain,
      Than thus remember thee!
    The all of thine that cannot die
    Through dark and dread Eternity
      Returns again to me,
    And more thy buried love endears
    Than aught, except its living years.
                                                      
              LINES TO A LADY WEEPING.

    Weep, daughter of a royal line,
      A Sire's disgrace, a realm's decay;
    Ah! happy if each tear of thine
      Could wash a Father's fault away!
    Weep--for thy tears are Virtue's tears--
      Auspicious to these suffering Isles;
    And be each drop in future years
      Repaid thee by thy People's smiles!
                                                          
           IF SOMETIMES IN THE HAUNTS OF MEN.

                    1.

    If sometimes in the haunts of men
      Thine image from my breast may fade,
    The lonely hour presents again
      The semblance of thy gentle shade:
    And now that sad and silent hour
      Thus much of thee can still restore,
    And sorrow unobserved may pour
      The plaint she dare not speak before.

                    2.

    Oh, pardon that in crowds awhile
      I waste one thought I owe to thee,
    And self-condemned, appear to smile,
      Unfaithful to thy memory:
    Nor deem that memory less dear,
      That then I seem not to repine;
    I would not fools should overhear
      One sigh that should be wholly thine.

                    3.

    If not the Goblet pass unquaffed,
      It is not drained to banish care;
    The cup must hold a deadlier draught
      That brings a Lethe for despair.
    And could Oblivion set my soul
      From all her troubled visions free,
    I'd dash to earth the sweetest bowl
      That drowned a single thought of thee.

                    4.

    For wert thou vanished from my mind,
      Where could my vacant bosom turn?
    And who would then remain behind
      To honour thine abandoned Urn?
    No, no--it is my sorrow's pride
      That last dear duty to fulfil;
    Though all the world forget beside,
      'Tis meet that I remember still.

                    5.

    For well I know, that such had been
      Thy gentle care for him, who now
    Unmourned shall quit this mortal scene,
      Where none regarded him, but thou:
    And, oh! I feel in that was given
      A blessing never meant for me;
    Thou wert too like a dream of Heaven,
      For earthly Love to merit thee.
                                                        
         ON A CORNELIAN HEART WHICH WAS BROKEN.

                    1.

    Ill-fated Heart! and can it be,
      That thou shouldst thus be rent in twain?
    Have years of care for thine and thee
      Alike been all employed in vain?

                    2.

    Yet precious seems each shattered part,
      And every fragment dearer grown,
    Since he who wears thee feels thou art
      A fitter emblem of his own.
                                                       
                     THE CHAIN I GAVE.
                     FROM THE TURKISH.

                    1.

    The chain I gave was fair to view,
      The lute I added sweet in sound;
    The heart that offered both was true,
      And ill deserved the fate it found.

                    2.

    These gifts were charmed by secret spell,
      Thy truth in absence to divine;
    And they have done their duty well,--
      Alas! they could not teach thee thine.

                    3.

    That chain was firm in every link,
      But not to bear a stranger's touch;
    That lute was sweet--till thou couldst think
      In other hands its notes were such.

                    4.

    Let him who from thy neck unbound
      The chain which shivered in his grasp,
    Who saw that lute refuse to sound,
      Restring the chords, renew the clasp.

                    5.

    When thou wert changed, they altered too;
      The chain is broke, the music mute,
    'Tis past--to them and thee adieu--
      False heart, frail chain, and silent lute.
         
              LINES WRITTEN ON A BLANK LEAF OF
               THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY.

                    1.

    Absent or present, still to thee,
      My friend, what magic spells belong!
    As all can tell, who share, like me,
      In turn thy converse, and thy song.

                    2.

    But when the dreaded hour shall come
      By Friendship ever deemed too nigh,
    And "Memory" o'er her Druid's tomb
      Shall weep that aught of thee can die,

                    3.

    How fondly will she then repay
      Thy homage offered at her shrine,
    And blend, while ages roll away,
      Her name immortally with thine!
                                                         
             ADDRESS, SPOKEN AT THE OPENING OF
                    DRURY-LANE THEATRE,
              SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1812.

    In one dread night our city saw, and sighed,
    Bowed to the dust, the Drama's tower of pride;
    In one short hour beheld the blazing fane,
    Apollo sink, and Shakespeare cease to reign.

      Ye who beheld, (oh! sight admired and mourned,
    Whose radiance mocked the ruin it adorned!)
    Through clouds of fire the massy fragments riven,
    Like Israel's pillar, chase the night from heaven;
    Saw the long column of revolving flames
    Shake its red shadow o'er the startled Thames,
    While thousands, thronged around the burning dome,
    Shrank back appalled, and trembled for their home,
    As glared the volumed blaze, and ghastly shone
    The skies, with lightnings awful as their own,
    Till blackening ashes and the lonely wall
    Usurped the Muse's realm, and marked her fall;
    Say--shall this new, nor less aspiring pile,
    Reared where once rose the mightiest in our isle,
    Know the same favour which the former knew,
    A shrine for Shakespeare--worthy him and you?

      Yes--it shall be--the magic of that name
    Defies the scythe of time, the torch of flame;
    On the same spot still consecrates the scene,
    And bids the Drama be where she hath been:
    This fabric's birth attests the potent spell----
    Indulge our honest pride, and say, How well!

      As soars this fane to emulate the last,
    Oh! might we draw our omens from the past,
    Some hour propitious to our prayers may boast
    Names such as hallow still the dome we lost.
    On Drury first your Siddons' thrilling art
    O'erwhelmed the gentlest, stormed the sternest heart.
    On Drury, Garrick's latest laurels grew;
    Here your last tears retiring Roscius drew,
    Sighed his last thanks, and wept his last adieu:
    But still for living wit the wreaths may bloom,
    That only waste their odours o'er the tomb.
    Such Drury claimed and claims--nor you refuse
    One tribute to revive his slumbering muse;
    With garlands deck your own Menander's head,
    Nor hoard your honours idly for the dead!
    Dear are the days which made our annals bright,
    Ere Garrick fled, or Brinsley ceased to write
    Heirs to their labours, like all high-born heirs,
    Vain of our ancestry as they of theirs;
    While thus Remembrance borrows Banquo's glass
    To claim the sceptred shadows as they pass,
    And we the mirror hold, where imaged shine
    Immortal names, emblazoned on our line,
    Pause--ere their feebler offspring you condemn,
    Reflect how hard the task to rival them!

      Friends of the stage! to whom both Players and Plays
    Must sue alike for pardon or for praise,
    Whose judging voice and eye alone direct
    The boundless power to cherish or reject;
    If e'er frivolity has led to fame,
    And made us blush that you forbore to blame--
    If e'er the sinking stage could condescend
    To soothe the sickly taste it dare not mend--
    All past reproach may present scenes refute,
    And censure, wisely loud, be justly mute!
    Oh! since your fiat stamps the Drama's laws,
    Forbear to mock us with misplaced applause;
    So Pride shall doubly nerve the actor's powers,
    And Reason's voice be echoed back by ours!

      This greeting o'er--the ancient rule obeyed,
    The Drama's homage by her herald paid--
    Receive our welcome too--whose every tone
    Springs from our hearts, and fain would win your own.
    The curtain rises--may our stage unfold
    Scenes not unworthy Drury's days of old!
    Britons our judges, Nature for our guide,
    Still may we please--long, long may you preside.
           
                 PARENTHETICAL ADDRESS.

                      BY DR. PLAGIARY.

  Half stolen, with acknowledgments, to be spoken in an
      inarticulate voice by Master ---- at the opening of the next
      new theatre.

    "When energising objects men pursue,"
    Then Lord knows what is writ by Lord knows who.
    A modest Monologue you here survey,
    Hissed from the theatre the "other day,"
    As if Sir Fretful wrote "the slumberous" verse,
    And gave his son "the rubbish" to rehearse.
    "Yet at the thing you'd never be amazed,"
    Knew you the rumpus which the Author raised;
    "Nor even here your smiles would be represt,"
    Knew you these lines--the badness of the best,
    "Flame! fire! and flame!" (words borrowed from Lucretius.)
    "Dread metaphors" which open wounds like issues!
    "And sleeping pangs awake--and----But away"--
    (Confound me if I know what next to say).
    Lo "Hope reviving re-expands her wings,"
    And Master G---- recites what Dr. Busby sings!--
    "If mighty things with small we may compare,"
    (Translated from the Grammar for the fair!)
    Dramatic "spirit drives a conquering car,"
    And burn'd poor Moscow like a tub of "tar."
    "This spirit" "Wellington has shown in Spain,"
    To furnish Melodrames for Drury Lane.
    "Another Marlborough points to Blenheim's story,"
    And George and I will dramatise it for ye.

      "In Arts and Sciences our Isle hath shone"
    (This deep discovery is mine alone).
    Oh "British poesy, whose powers inspire"
    My verse--or I'm a fool--and Fame's a liar,
    "Thee we invoke, your Sister Arts implore"
    With "smiles," and "lyres," and "pencils," and much more.
    These, if we win the Graces, too, we gain
    Disgraces, too! "inseparable train!"
    "Three who have stolen their witching airs from Cupid"
    (You all know what I mean, unless you're stupid):
    "Harmonious throng" that I have kept in petto
    Now to produce in a "divine sestetto"!!
    "While Poesy," with these delightful doxies,
    "Sustains her part" in all the "upper" boxes!
    "Thus lifted gloriously, you'll sweep along,"
    Borne in the vast balloon of Busby's song;
    "Shine in your farce, masque, scenery, and play"
    (For this last line George had a holiday).
    "Old Drury never, never soar'd so high,"
    So says the Manager, and so say I.
    "But hold," you say, "this self-complacent boast;"
    Is this the Poem which the public lost?
    "True--true--that lowers at once our mounting pride;"
    But lo;--the Papers print what you deride.
    "'Tis ours to look on you--you hold the prize,"
    'Tis twenty guineas, as they advertise!
    "A double blessing your rewards impart"--
    I wish I had them, then, with all my heart.
    "Our twofold feeling owns its twofold cause,"
    Why son and I both beg for your applause.
    "When in your fostering beams you bid us live,"
    My next subscription list shall say how much you give!

     VERSES FOUND IN A SUMMER-HOUSE AT HALES-OWEN.

    When Dryden's fool, "unknowing what he sought,"
    His hours in whistling spent, "for want of thought,"
    This guiltless oaf his vacancy of sense
    Supplied, and amply too, by innocence:
    Did modern swains, possessed of Cymon's powers,
    In Cymon's manner waste their leisure hours,
    Th' offended guests would not, with blushing, see
    These fair green walks disgraced by infamy.
    Severe the fate of modern fools, alas!
    When vice and folly mark them as they pass.
    Like noxious reptiles o'er the whitened wall,
    The filth they leave still points out where they crawl.

             REMEMBER THEE! REMEMBER THEE!

                    1.

    Remember thee! remember thee!
      Till Lethe quench life's burning stream
    Remorse and Shame shall cling to thee,
      And haunt thee like a feverish dream!

                    2.

    Remember thee! Aye, doubt it not.
      Thy husband too shall think of thee:
    By neither shalt thou be forgot,
      Thou false to him, thou fiend to me!

                          TO TIME.

    Time! on whose arbitrary wing
      The varying hours must flag or fly,
    Whose tardy winter, fleeting spring,
      But drag or drive us on to die--
    Hail thou! who on my birth bestowed
      Those boons to all that know thee known;
    Yet better I sustain thy load,
      For now I bear the weight alone.
    I would not one fond heart should share
      The bitter moments thou hast given;
    And pardon thee--since thou couldst spare
      All that I loved, to peace or Heaven.
    To them be joy or rest--on me
      Thy future ills shall press in vain;
    I nothing owe but years to thee,
      A debt already paid in pain.
    Yet even that pain was some relief;
      It felt, but still forgot thy power:
    The active agony of grief
      Retards, but never counts the hour.
    In joy I've sighed to think thy flight
      Would soon subside from swift to slow;
    Thy cloud could overcast the light,
      But could not add a night to Woe;
    For then, however drear and dark,
      My soul was suited to thy sky;
    One star alone shot forth a spark
      To prove thee--not Eternity.
    That beam hath sunk--and now thou art
      A blank--a thing to count and curse
    Through each dull tedious trifling part,
      Which all regret, yet all rehearse.
    One scene even thou canst not deform--
      The limit of thy sloth or speed
    When future wanderers bear the storm
      Which we shall sleep too sound to heed.
    And I can smile to think how weak
      Thine efforts shortly shall be shown,
    When all the vengeance thou canst wreak
      Must fall upon--a nameless stone.

             TRANSLATION OF A ROMAIC LOVE SONG.

                    1.

    Ah! Love was never yet without
    The pang, the agony, the doubt,
    Which rends my heart with ceaseless sigh,
    While day and night roll darkling by.

                    2.

    Without one friend to hear my woe,
    I faint, I die beneath the blow.
    That Love had arrows, well I knew,
    Alas! I find them poisoned too.

                    3.

    Birds, yet in freedom, shun the net
    Which Love around your haunts hath set;
    Or, circled by his fatal fire,
    Your hearts shall burn, your hopes expire.

                    4.

    A bird of free and careless wing
    Was I, through many a smiling spring;
    But caught within the subtle snare,
    I burn, and feebly flutter there.

                    5.

    Who ne'er have loved, and loved in vain,
    Can neither feel nor pity pain,
    The cold repulse, the look askance,
    The lightning of Love's angry glance.

                    6.

    In flattering dreams I deemed thee mine;
    Now hope, and he who hoped, decline;
    Like melting wax, or withering flower,
    I feel my passion, and thy power.

                    7.

    My light of Life! ah, tell me why
    That pouting lip, and altered eye?
    My bird of Love! my beauteous mate!
    And art thou changed, and canst thou hate?

                    8.

    Mine eyes like wintry streams o'erflow:
    What wretch with me would barter woe?
    My bird! relent: one note could give
    A charm to bid thy lover live.

                    9.

    My curdling blood, my madd'ning brain,
    In silent anguish I sustain;
    And still thy heart, without partaking
    One pang, exults--while mine is breaking.

                    10.

    Pour me the poison; fear not thou!
    Thou canst not murder more than now:
    I've lived to curse my natal day,
    And Love, that thus can lingering slay.

                    11.

    My wounded soul, my bleeding breast,
    Can patience preach thee into rest?
    Alas! too late, I dearly know
    That Joy is harbinger of Woe.

      THOU ART NOT FALSE, BUT THOU ART FICKLE.

                    1.

    Thou art not false, but thou art fickle,
      To those thyself so fondly sought;
    The tears that thou hast forced to trickle
      Are doubly bitter from that thought:
    'Tis this which breaks the heart thou grievest,
    Too well thou lov'st--too soon thou leavest.

                    2.

    The wholly false the heart despises,
      And spurns deceiver and deceit;
    But she who not a thought disguises,
      Whose love is as sincere as sweet,--
    When she can change who loved so truly,
    It feels what mine has felt so newly.

                    3.

    To dream of joy and wake to sorrow
      Is doomed to all who love or live;
    And if, when conscious on the morrow,
      We scarce our Fancy can forgive,
    That cheated us in slumber only,
    To leave the waking soul more lonely,

                    4.

    What must they feel whom no false vision
      But truest, tenderest Passion warmed?
    Sincere, but swift in sad transition:
      As if a dream alone had charmed?
    Ah! sure such grief is Fancy's scheming,
    And all thy Change can be but dreaming!

           ON BEING ASKED WHAT WAS THE "ORIGIN OF LOVE."

    The "Origin of Love!"--Ah, why
      That cruel question ask of me,
    When thou mayst read in many an eye
      He starts to life on seeing thee?
    And shouldst thou seek his end to know:
      My heart forebodes, my fears foresee,
    He'll linger long in silent woe;
      But live until--I cease to be.

                     ON THE QUOTATION,

    "And my true faith can alter never,
    Though thou art gone perhaps for ever."

                    1.

    And "thy true faith can alter never?"--
      Indeed it lasted for a--week!
    I know the length of Love's forever,
      And just expected such a freak.
    In peace we met, in peace we parted,
      In peace we vowed to meet again,
    And though I find thee fickle-hearted
      No pang of mine shall make thee vain.

                    2.

    One gone--'twas time to seek a second;
      In sooth 'twere hard to blame thy haste.
    And whatsoe'er thy love be reckoned,
      At least thou hast improved in taste:
    Though one was young, the next was younger,
      His love was new, mine too well known--
    And what might make the charm still stronger,
      The youth was present, I was flown.

                    3.

    Seven days and nights of single sorrow!
      Too much for human constancy!
    A fortnight past, why then to-morrow,
      His turn is come to follow me:
    And if each week you change a lover,
      And so have acted heretofore,
    Before a year or two is over
      We'll form a very pretty corps.

                    4.

    Adieu, fair thing! without upbraiding
      I fain would take a decent leave;
    Thy beauty still survives unfading,
      And undeceived may long deceive.
    With him unto thy bosom dearer
      Enjoy the moments as they flee;
    I only wish his love sincerer
      Than thy young heart has been to me.

          REMEMBER HIM, WHOM PASSION'S POWER.

                    1.

    Remember him, whom Passion's power
      Severely--deeply--vainly proved:
    Remember thou that dangerous hour,
      When neither fell, though both were loved.

                    2.

    That yielding breast, that melting eye,
      Too much invited to be blessed:
    That gentle prayer, that pleading sigh,
      The wilder wish reproved, repressed.

                    3.

    Oh! let me feel that all I lost
      But saved thee all that Conscience fears;
    And blush for every pang it cost
      To spare the vain remorse of years.

                    4.

    Yet think of this when many a tongue,
      Whose busy accents whisper blame,
    Would do the heart that loved thee wrong,
      And brand a nearly blighted name.

                    5.

    Think that, whate'er to others, thou
      Hast seen each selfish thought subdued:
    I bless thy purer soul even now,
      Even now, in midnight solitude.

                    6.

    Oh, God! that we had met in time,
      Our hearts as fond, thy hand more free;
    When thou hadst loved without a crime,
      And I been less unworthy thee!

                    7.

    Far may thy days, as heretofore,
      From this our gaudy world be past!
    And that too bitter moment o'er,
      Oh! may such trial be thy last.

                    8.

    This heart, alas! perverted long,
      Itself destroyed might there destroy;
    To meet thee in the glittering throng,
      Would wake Presumption's hope of joy.

                    9.

    Then to the things whose bliss or woe,
      Like mine, is wild and worthless all,
    That world resign--such scenes forego,
      Where those who feel must surely fall.

                    10.

    Thy youth, thy charms, thy tenderness--
      Thy soul from long seclusion pure;
    From what even here hath passed, may guess
        What there thy bosom must endure.

                    11.

    Oh! pardon that imploring tear,
      Since not by Virtue shed in vain,
    My frenzy drew from eyes so dear;
      For me they shall not weep again.

                    12.

    Though long and mournful must it be,
      The thought that we no more may meet;
    Yet I deserve the stern decree,
      And almost deem the sentence sweet.

                    13.

    Still--had I loved thee less--my heart
      Had then less sacrificed to thine;
    It felt not half so much to part
      As if its guilt had made thee mine.
                                                                  
            IMPROMPTU, IN REPLY TO A FRIEND.

    When, from the heart where Sorrow sits,
      Her dusky shadow mounts too high,
    And o'er the changing aspect flits,
      And clouds the brow, or fills the eye;
    Heed not that gloom, which soon shall sink:
      My Thoughts their dungeon know too well;
    Back to my breast the Wanderers shrink,
      And droop within their silent cell.
                                                     
                          SONNET.

                        TO GENEVRA.

    Thine eyes' blue tenderness, thy long fair hair,
      And the warm lustre of thy features--caught
      From contemplation--where serenely wrought,
    Seems Sorrow's softness charmed from its despair--
    Have thrown such speaking sadness in thine air,
      That--but I know thy blessed bosom fraught
      With mines of unalloyed and stainless thought--
    I should have deemed thee doomed to earthly care.
    With such an aspect, by his colours blent,
      When from his beauty-breathing pencil born,
    (Except that thou hast nothing to repent)
      The Magdalen of Guido saw the morn--
    Such seem'st thou--but how much more excellent!
      With nought Remorse can claim--nor Virtue scorn.
                                                
                          SONNET.

                        TO GENEVRA.

    Thy cheek is pale with thought, but not from woe,
      And yet so lovely, that if Mirth could flush
      Its rose of whiteness with the brightest blush,
    My heart would wish away that ruder glow:
    And dazzle not thy deep-blue eyes--but, oh!
      While gazing on them sterner eyes will gush,
      And into mine my mother's weakness rush,
    Soft as the last drops round Heaven's airy bow.
    For, through thy long dark lashes low depending,
      The soul of melancholy Gentleness
    Gleams like a Seraph from the sky descending,
      Above all pain, yet pitying all distress;
    At once such majesty with sweetness blending,
      I worship more, but cannot love thee less.
                                                     
                    FROM THE PORTUGUESE.

                       "TU MI CHAMAS"

                    1.

    In moments to delight devoted,
      "My Life!" with tenderest tone, you cry;
    Dear words! on which my heart had doted,
      If Youth could neither fade nor die.

                    2.

    To Death even hours like these must roll,
      Ah! then repeat those accents never;
    Or change "my Life!" into "my Soul!"
      Which, like my Love, exists for ever.
                                                               
                      ANOTHER VERSION.

    You call me still your Life.--Oh! change the word--
      Life is as transient as the inconstant sigh:
    Say rather I'm your Soul; more just that name,
      For, like the soul, my Love can never die.
                   
                                THE GIAOUR:

                       A FRAGMENT OF A TURKISH TALE.

    "One fatal remembrance--one sorrow that throws
    Its bleak shade alike o'er our joys and our woes--
    To which Life nothing darker nor brighter can bring,
    For which joy hath no balm--and affliction no sting."

                                                                    MOORE.

      No breath of air to break the wave
    That rolls below the Athenian's grave,
    That tomb which, gleaming o'er the cliff,
    First greets the homeward-veering skiff
    High o'er the land he saved in vain;
    When shall such Hero live again?

      Fair clime! where every season smiles
    Benignant o'er those blessed isles,
    Which, seen from far Colonna's height,
    Make glad the heart that hails the sight,
    And lend to loneliness delight.
    There mildly dimpling, Ocean's cheek
    Reflects the tints of many a peak
    Caught by the laughing tides that lave
    These Edens of the eastern wave:
    And if at times a transient breeze
    Break the blue crystal of the seas,
    Or sweep one blossom from the trees,
    How welcome is each gentle air
    That wakes and wafts the odours there!
    For there the Rose, o'er crag or vale,
    Sultana of the Nightingale,
      The maid for whom his melody,
      His thousand songs are heard on high,
    Blooms blushing to her lover's tale:
    His queen, the garden queen, his Rose,
    Unbent by winds, unchilled by snows,
    Far from the winters of the west,
    By every breeze and season blest,
    Returns the sweets by Nature given
    In softest incense back to Heaven;
    And grateful yields that smiling sky
    Her fairest hue and fragrant sigh.
    And many a summer flower is there,
    And many a shade that Love might share,
    And many a grotto, meant for rest,
    That holds the pirate for a guest;
    Whose bark in sheltering cove below
    Lurks for the passing peaceful prow,
    Till the gay mariner's guitar
    Is heard, and seen the Evening Star;
    Then stealing with the muffled oar,
    Far shaded by the rocky shore,
    Rush the night-prowlers on the prey,
    And turn to groans his roundelay.
    Strange--that where Nature loved to trace,
    As if for Gods, a dwelling place,
    And every charm and grace hath mixed
    Within the Paradise she fixed,
    There man, enamoured of distress,
    Should mar it into wilderness,
    And trample, brute-like, o'er each flower
    That tasks not one laborious hour;
    Nor claims the culture of his hand
    To bloom along the fairy land,
    But springs as to preclude his care,
    And sweetly woos him--but to spare!
    Strange--that where all is Peace beside,
    There Passion riots in her pride,
    And Lust and Rapine wildly reign
    To darken o'er the fair domain.
    It is as though the Fiends prevailed
    Against the Seraphs they assailed,
    And, fixed on heavenly thrones, should dwell
    The freed inheritors of Hell;
    So soft the scene, so formed for joy,
    So curst the tyrants that destroy!

      He who hath bent him o'er the dead
    Ere the first day of Death is fled,
    The first dark day of Nothingness,
    The last of Danger and Distress,
    (Before Decay's effacing fingers
    Have swept the lines where Beauty lingers,)
    And marked the mild angelic air,
    The rapture of Repose that's there,
    The fixed yet tender traits that streak
    The languor of the placid cheek,
    And--but for that sad shrouded eye,
      That fires not, wins not, weeps not, now,
      And but for that chill, changeless brow,
      Where cold Obstruction's apathy
      Appals the gazing mourner's heart,
      As if to him it could impart
      The doom he dreads, yet dwells upon;
      Yes, but for these and these alone,
      Some moments, aye, one treacherous hour,
      He still might doubt the Tyrant's power;
      So fair, so calm, so softly sealed,
      The first, last look by Death revealed!
      Such is the aspect of this shore;
      'Tis Greece, but living Greece no more!
      So coldly sweet, so deadly fair,
      We start, for Soul is wanting there.
      Hers is the loveliness in death,
      That parts not quite with parting breath;
      But beauty with that fearful bloom,
      That hue which haunts it to the tomb,
      Expression's last receding ray,
      A gilded Halo hovering round decay,
      The farewell beam of Feeling past away!
    Spark of that flame, perchance of heavenly birth,
    Which gleams, but warms no more its cherished earth!

        Clime of the unforgotten brave!
      Whose land from plain to mountain-cave
      Was Freedom's home or Glory's grave!
      Shrine of the mighty! can it be,
      That this is all remains of thee?
      Approach, thou craven crouching slave:
        Say, is not this Thermopylae?
      These waters blue that round you lave,--
        Oh servile offspring of the free--
      Pronounce what sea, what shore is this?
      The gulf, the rock of Salamis!
      These scenes, their story not unknown,
      Arise, and make again your own;
      Snatch from the ashes of your Sires
      The embers of their former fires;
      And he who in the strife expires
      Will add to theirs a name of fear
      That Tyranny shall quake to hear,
      And leave his sons a hope, a fame,
      They too will rather die than shame:
      For Freedom's battle once begun,
      Bequeathed by bleeding Sire to Son,
      Though baffled oft is ever won.
      Bear witness, Greece, thy living page!
      Attest it many a deathless age!
      While Kings, in dusty darkness hid,
      Have left a nameless pyramid,
      Thy Heroes, though the general doom
      Hath swept the column from their tomb,
      A mightier monument command,
      The mountains of their native land!
      There points thy Muse to stranger's eye
      The graves of those that cannot die!
      'Twere long to tell, and sad to trace,
      Each step from Splendour to Disgrace;
      Enough--no foreign foe could quell
      Thy soul, till from itself it fell;
      Yet! Self-abasement paved the way
      To villain-bonds and despot sway.

      What can he tell who treads thy shore?
        No legend of thine olden time,
      No theme on which the Muse might soar
      High as thine own in days of yore,
        When man was worthy of thy clime.
      The hearts within thy valleys bred,
      The fiery souls that might have led
        Thy sons to deeds sublime,
      Now crawl from cradle to the Grave,
      Slaves--nay, the bondsmen of a Slave,
        And callous, save to crime;
      Stained with each evil that pollutes
      Mankind, where least above the brutes;
      Without even savage virtue blest,
      Without one free or valiant breast,
      Still to the neighbouring ports they waft
      Proverbial wiles, and ancient craft;
      In this the subtle Greek is found,
      For this, and this alone, renowned.
      In vain might Liberty invoke
      The spirit to its bondage broke
      Or raise the neck that courts the yoke:
      No more her sorrows I bewail,
      Yet this will be a mournful tale,
      And they who listen may believe,
      Who heard it first had cause to grieve.

        Far, dark, along the blue sea glancing,
      The shadows of the rocks advancing
      Start on the fisher's eye like boat
      Of island-pirate or Mainote;
      And fearful for his light caique,
      He shuns the near but doubtful creek:
      Though worn and weary with his toil,
      And cumbered with his scaly spoil,
      Slowly, yet strongly, plies the oar,
      Till Port Leone's safer shore
      Receives him by the lovely light
      That best becomes an Eastern night.

        Who thundering comes on blackest steed,
      With slackened bit and hoof of speed?
      Beneath the clattering iron's sound
      The caverned Echoes wake around
      In lash for lash, and bound for bound:
      The foam that streaks the courser's side
      Seems gathered from the Ocean-tide:
      Though weary waves are sunk to rest,
      There's none within his rider's breast;
      And though to-morrow's tempest lower,
      'Tis calmer than thy heart, young Giaour!
      I know thee not, I loathe thy race,
      But in thy lineaments I trace
      What Time shall strengthen, not efface:
      Though young and pale, that sallow front
      Is scathed by fiery Passion's brunt;
      Though bent on earth thine evil eye,
      As meteor-like thou glidest by,
      Right well I view and deem thee one
      Whom Othman's sons should slay or shun.

        On--on he hastened, and he drew
      My gaze of wonder as he flew:
      Though like a Demon of the night
      He passed, and vanished from my sight,
      His aspect and his air impressed
      A troubled memory on my breast,
      And long upon my startled ear
      Rung his dark courser's hoofs of fear.
      He spurs his steed; he nears the steep,
      That, jutting, shadows o'er the deep;
      He winds around; he hurries by;
      The rock relieves him from mine eye;
      For, well I ween, unwelcome he
      Whose glance is fixed on those that flee;
      And not a star but shines too bright
      On him who takes such timeless flight.
      He wound along; but ere he passed
      One glance he snatched, as if his last,
      A moment checked his wheeling steed,
      A moment breathed him from his speed,
      A moment on his stirrup stood--
      Why looks he o'er the olive wood?
      The Crescent glimmers on the hill,
      The Mosque's high lamps are quivering still
      Though too remote for sound to wake
      In echoes of the far tophaike,
      The flashes of each joyous peal
      Are seen to prove the Moslem's zeal.
      To-night, set Rhamazani's sun;
      To-night, the Bairam feast's begun;
      To-night--but who and what art thou
      Of foreign garb and fearful brow?
      And what are these to thine or thee,
      That thou shouldst either pause or flee?

        He stood--some dread was on his face,
      Soon Hatred settled in its place:
      It rose not with the reddening flush
      Of transient Anger's hasty blush,
      But pale as marble o'er the tomb,
      Whose ghastly whiteness aids its gloom.
      His brow was bent, his eye was glazed;
      He raised his arm, and fiercely raised,
      And sternly shook his hand on high,
      As doubting to return or fly;
      Impatient of his flight delayed,
      Here loud his raven charger neighed--
      Down glanced that hand, and grasped his blade;
      That sound had burst his waking dream,
      As Slumber starts at owlet's scream.
      The spur hath lanced his courser's sides;
      Away--away--for life he rides:
      Swift as the hurled on high jerreed
      Springs to the touch his startled steed;
      The rock is doubled, and the shore
      Shakes with the clattering tramp no more;
      The crag is won, no more is seen
      His Christian crest and haughty mien.
      'Twas but an instant he restrained
      That fiery barb so sternly reined;
      'Twas but a moment that he stood,
      Then sped as if by Death pursued;
      But in that instant o'er his soul
      Winters of Memory seemed to roll,
      And gather in that drop of time
      A life of pain, an age of crime.
      O'er him who loves, or hates, or fears,
      Such moment pours the grief of years:
      What felt he then, at once opprest
      By all that most distracts the breast?
      That pause, which pondered o'er his fate,
      Oh, who its dreary length shall date!
      Though in Time's record nearly nought,
      It was Eternity to Thought!
      For infinite as boundless space
      The thought that Conscience must embrace,
      Which in itself can comprehend
      Woe without name, or hope, or end.

        The hour is past, the Giaour is gone:
      And did he fly or fall alone?
      Woe to that hour he came or went!
      The curse for Hassan's sin was sent
      To turn a palace to a tomb;
      He came, he went, like the Simoom,
      That harbinger of Fate and gloom,
      Beneath whose widely-wasting breath
      The very cypress droops to death--
    Dark tree, still sad when others' grief is fled,
    The only constant mourner o'er the dead!

        The steed is vanished from the stall;
      No serf is seen in Hassan's hall;
      The lonely Spider's thin gray pall
      Waves slowly widening o'er the wall;
      The Bat builds in his Haram bower,
      And in the fortress of his power
      The Owl usurps the beacon-tower;
      The wild-dog howls o'er the fountain's brim,
      With baffled thirst, and famine, grim;
    For the stream has shrunk from its marble bed,
    Where the weeds and the desolate dust are spread.
      'Twas sweet of yore to see it play
      And chase the sultriness of day,
      As springing high the silver dew
      In whirls fantastically flew,
      And flung luxurious coolness round
      The air, and verdure o'er the ground.
      'Twas sweet, when cloudless stars were bright,
      To view the wave of watery light,
      And hear its melody by night.
      And oft had Hassan's Childhood played
      Around the verge of that cascade;
      And oft upon his mother's breast
      That sound had harmonized his rest;
      And oft had Hassan's Youth along
      Its bank been soothed by Beauty's song;
      And softer seemed each melting tone
      Of Music mingled with its own.
      But ne'er shall Hassan's Age repose
      Along the brink at Twilight's close:
      The stream that filled that font is fled--
      The blood that warmed his heart is shed!
      And here no more shall human voice
      Be heard to rage, regret, rejoice.
      The last sad note that swelled the gale
      Was woman's wildest funeral wail:
      That quenched in silence, all is still,
      But the lattice that flaps when the wind is shrill:
      Though raves the gust, and floods the rain,
      No hand shall close its clasp again.
      On desert sands 'twere joy to scan
      The rudest steps of fellow man,
      So here the very voice of Grief
      Might wake an Echo like relief--
      At least 'twould say, "All are not gone;
      There lingers Life, though but in one"--
      For many a gilded chamber's there,
      Which Solitude might well forbear;
      Within that dome as yet Decay
      Hath slowly worked her cankering way--
      But gloom is gathered o'er the gate,
      Nor there the Fakir's self will wait;
      Nor there will wandering Dervise stay,
      For Bounty cheers not his delay;
      Nor there will weary stranger halt
      To bless the sacred "bread and salt."
        Alike must Wealth and Poverty
        Pass heedless and unheeded by,
        For Courtesy and Pity died
        With Hassan on the mountain side.
        His roof, that refuge unto men,
        Is Desolation's hungry den.
    The guest flies the hall, and the vassal from labour,
    Since his turban was cleft by the infidel's sabre!

          I hear the sound of coming feet,
        But not a voice mine ear to greet;
        More near--each turban I can scan,
        And silver-sheathed ataghan;
        The foremost of the band is seen
        An Emir by his garb of green:
    "Ho! who art thou?"--"This low salam
    Replies of Moslem faith I am.
    The burthen ye so gently bear,
    Seems one that claims your utmost care,
    And, doubtless, holds some precious freight--
    My humble bark would gladly wait."

      "Thou speakest sooth: thy skiff unmoor,
    And waft us from the silent shore;
    Nay, leave the sail still furled, and ply
    The nearest oar that's scattered by,
    And midway to those rocks where sleep
    The channelled waters dark and deep.
    Rest from your task--so--bravely done,
    Our course has been right swiftly run;
    Yet 'tis the longest voyage, I trow,
    That one of--  "

      Sullen it plunged, and slowly sank,
    The calm wave rippled to the bank;
    I watched it as it sank, methought
    Some motion from the current caught
    Bestirred it more,--'twas but the beam
    That checkered o'er the living stream:
    I gazed, till vanishing from view,
    Like lessening pebble it withdrew;
    Still less and less, a speck of white
    That gemmed the tide, then mocked the sight;
    And all its hidden secrets sleep,
    Known but to Genii of the deep,
    Which, trembling in their coral caves,
    They dare not whisper to the waves.

      As rising on its purple wing
    The insect-queen of Eastern spring,
    O'er emerald meadows of Kashmeer
    Invites the young pursuer near,
    And leads him on from flower to flower
    A weary chase and wasted hour,
    Then leaves him, as it soars on high,
    With panting heart and tearful eye:
    So Beauty lures the full-grown child,
    With hue as bright, and wing as wild:
    A chase of idle hopes and fears,
    Begun in folly, closed in tears.
    If won, to equal ills betrayed,
    Woe waits the insect and the maid;
    A life of pain, the loss of peace;
    From infant's play, and man's caprice:
    The lovely toy so fiercely sought
    Hath lost its charm by being caught,
    For every touch that wooed its stay
    Hath brushed its brightest hues away,
    Till charm, and hue, and beauty gone,
    'Tis left to fly or fall alone.
    With wounded wing, or bleeding breast,
    Ah! where shall either victim rest?
    Can this with faded pinion soar
    From rose to tulip as before?
    Or Beauty, blighted in an hour,
    Find joy within her broken bower?
    No: gayer insects fluttering by
    Ne'er droop the wing o'er those that die,
    And lovelier things have mercy shown
    To every failing but their own,
    And every woe a tear can claim
    Except an erring Sister's shame.

    The Mind, that broods o'er guilty woes,
      Is like the Scorpion girt by fire;
    In circle narrowing as it glows,
    The flames around their captive close,
    Till inly searched by thousand throes,
      And maddening in her ire,
    One sad and sole relief she knows--
    The sting she nourished for her foes,
    Whose venom never yet was vain,
    Gives but one pang, and cures all pain,
    And darts into her desperate brain:
    So do the dark in soul expire,
    Or live like Scorpion girt by fire;
    So writhes the mind Remorse hath riven,
    Unfit for earth, undoomed for heaven,
    Darkness above, despair beneath,
    Around it flame, within it death!

      Black Hassan from the Haram flies,
    Nor bends on woman's form his eyes;
    The unwonted chase each hour employs,
    Yet shares he not the hunter's joys.
    Not thus was Hassan wont to fly
    When Leila dwelt in his Serai.
    Doth Leila there no longer dwell?
    That tale can only Hassan tell:
    Strange rumours in our city say
    Upon that eve she fled away
    When Rhamazan's last sun was set,
    And flashing from each Minaret
    Millions of lamps proclaimed the feast
    Of Bairam through the boundless East.
    'Twas then she went as to the bath,
    Which Hassan vainly searched in wrath;
    For she was flown her master's rage
    In likeness of a Georgian page,
    And far beyond the Moslem's power
    Had wronged him with the faithless Giaour.
    Somewhat of this had Hassan deemed;
    But still so fond, so fair she seemed,
    Too well he trusted to the slave
    Whose treachery deserved a grave:
    And on that eve had gone to Mosque,
    And thence to feast in his Kiosk.
    Such is the tale his Nubians tell,
    Who did not watch their charge too well;
    But others say, that on that night,
    By pale Phingari's trembling light,
    The Giaour upon his jet-black steed
    Was seen, but seen alone to speed
    With bloody spur along the shore,
    Nor maid nor page behind him bore.

      Her eye's dark charm 'twere vain to tell,
    But gaze on that of the Gazelle,
    It will assist thy fancy well;
    As large, as languishingly dark,
    But Soul beamed forth in every spark
    That darted from beneath the lid,
    Bright as the jewel of Giamschid.
    Yea, Soul, and should our prophet say
    That form was nought but breathing clay,
    By Alla! I would answer nay;
    Though on Al-Sirat's arch I stood,
    Which totters o'er the fiery flood,
    With Paradise within my view,
    And all his Houris beckoning through.
    Oh! who young Leila's glance could read
    And keep that portion of his creed
    Which saith that woman is but dust,
    A soulless toy for tyrant's lust?
    On her might Muftis gaze, and own
    That through her eye the Immortal shone;
    On her fair cheek's unfading hue
    The young pomegranate's blossoms strew
    Their bloom in blushes ever new;
    Her hair in hyacinthine flow,
    When left to roll its folds below,
    As midst her handmaids in the hall
    She stood superior to them all,
    Hath swept the marble where her feet
    Gleamed whiter than the mountain sleet
    Ere from the cloud that gave it birth
    It fell, and caught one stain of earth.
    The cygnet nobly walks the water;
    So moved on earth Circassia's daughter,
    The loveliest bird of Franguestan!
    As rears her crest the ruffled Swan,
      And spurns the wave with wings of pride,
    When pass the steps of stranger man
      Along the banks that bound her tide;
    Thus rose fair Leila's whiter neck:--
    Thus armed with beauty would she check
    Intrusion's glance, till Folly's gaze
    Shrunk from the charms it meant to praise.
    Thus high and graceful was her gait;
    Her heart as tender to her mate;
    Her mate--stern Hassan, who was he?
    Alas! that name was not for thee!

      Stern Hassan hath a journey ta'en
    With twenty vassals in his train,
    Each armed, as best becomes a man,
    With arquebuss and ataghan;
    The chief before, as decked for war,
    Bears in his belt the scimitar
    Stained with the best of Arnaut blood,
    When in the pass the rebels stood,
    And few returned to tell the tale
    Of what befell in Parne's vale.
    The pistols which his girdle bore
    Were those that once a Pasha wore,
    Which still, though gemmed and bossed with gold,
    Even robbers tremble to behold.
    'Tis said he goes to woo a bride
    More true than her who left his side;
    The faithless slave that broke her bower,
    And--worse than faithless--for a Giaour!

      The sun's last rays are on the hill,
    And sparkle in the fountain rill,
    Whose welcome waters, cool and clear,
    Draw blessings from the mountaineer:
    Here may the loitering merchant Greek
    Find that repose 'twere vain to seek
    In cities lodged too near his lord,
    And trembling for his secret hoard--
    Here may he rest where none can see,
    In crowds a slave, in deserts free;
    And with forbidden wine may stain
    The bowl a Moslem must not drain

      The foremost Tartar's in the gap
    Conspicuous by his yellow cap;
    The rest in lengthening line the while
    Wind slowly through the long defile:
    Above, the mountain rears a peak,
    Where vultures whet the thirsty beak,
    And theirs may be a feast to-night,
    Shall tempt them down ere morrow's light;
    Beneath, a river's wintry stream
    Has shrunk before the summer beam,
    And left a channel bleak and bare,
    Save shrubs that spring to perish there:
    Each side the midway path there lay
    Small broken crags of granite gray,
    By time, or mountain lightning, riven
    From summits clad in mists of heaven;
    For where is he that hath beheld
    The peak of Liakura unveiled?

      They reach the grove of pine at last;
    "Bismillah! now the peril's past;
    For yonder view the opening plain,
    And there we'll prick our steeds amain:"
    The Chiaus spake, and as he said,
    A bullet whistled o'er his head;
    The foremost Tartar bites the ground!
      Scarce had they time to check the rein,
    Swift from their steeds the riders bound;
      But three shall never mount again:
    Unseen the foes that gave the wound,
      The dying ask revenge in vain.
    With steel unsheathed, and carbine bent,
    Some o'er their courser's harness leant,
      Half sheltered by the steed;
    Some fly beneath the nearest rock,
    And there await the coming shock,
      Nor tamely stand to bleed
    Beneath the shaft of foes unseen,
    Who dare not quit their craggy screen.
    Stern Hassan only from his horse
    Disdains to light, and keeps his course,
    Till fiery flashes in the van
    Proclaim too sure the robber-clan
    Have well secured the only way
    Could now avail the promised prey;
    Then curled his very beard with ire,
    And glared his eye with fiercer fire;
    "Though far and near the bullets hiss,
    I've scaped a bloodier hour than this."
    And now the foe their covert quit,
    And call his vassals to submit;
    But Hassan's frown and furious word
    Are dreaded more than hostile sword,
    Nor of his little band a man
    Resigned carbine or ataghan,
    Nor raised the craven cry, Amaun!
    In fuller sight, more near and near,
    The lately ambushed foes appear,
    And, issuing from the grove, advance
    Some who on battle-charger prance.
    Who leads them on with foreign brand
    Far flashing in his red right hand?
    "'Tis he!'tis he! I know him now;
    I know him by his pallid brow;
    I know him by the evil eye
    That aids his envious treachery;
    I know him by his jet-black barb;
    Though now arrayed in Arnaut garb,
    Apostate from his own vile faith,
    It shall not save him from the death:
    'Tis he! well met in any hour,
    Lost Leila's love--accursed Giaour!"

      As rolls the river into Ocean,
    In sable torrent wildly streaming;
      As the sea-tide's opposing motion,
    In azure column proudly gleaming,
    Beats back the current many a rood,
    In curling foam and mingling flood,
    While eddying whirl, and breaking wave,
    Roused by the blast of winter, rave;
    Through sparkling spray, in thundering clash,
    The lightnings of the waters flash
    In awful whiteness o'er the shore,
    That shines and shakes beneath the roar;
    Thus--as the stream and Ocean greet,
    With waves that madden as they meet--
    Thus join the bands, whom mutual wrong,
    And fate, and fury, drive along.
    The bickering sabres' shivering jar;
      And pealing wide or ringing near
      Its echoes on the throbbing ear,
    The deathshot hissing from afar;
    The shock, the shout, the groan of war,
      Reverberate along that vale,
      More suited to the shepherd's tale:
    Though few the numbers--theirs the strife,
    That neither spares nor speaks for life!
    Ah! fondly youthful hearts can press,
    To seize and share the dear caress;
    But Love itself could never pant
    For all that Beauty sighs to grant
    With half the fervour Hate bestows
    Upon the last embrace of foes,
    When grappling in the fight they fold
    Those arms that ne'er shall lose their hold:
    Friends meet to part; Love laughs at faith;
    True foes, once met, are joined till death!

      With sabre shivered to the hilt,
    Yet dripping with the blood he spilt;
    Yet strained within the severed hand
    Which quivers round that faithless brand;
    His turban far behind him rolled,
    And cleft in twain its firmest fold;
    His flowing robe by falchion torn,
    And crimson as those clouds of morn
    That, streaked with dusky red, portend
    The day shall have a stormy end;
    A stain on every bush that bore
    A fragment of his palampore;
    His breast with wounds unnumbered riven,
    His back to earth, his face to Heaven,
    Fall'n Hassan lies--his unclosed eye
    Yet lowering on his enemy,
    As if the hour that sealed his fate
    Surviving left his quenchless hate;
    And o'er him bends that foe with brow
    As dark as his that bled below.

      "Yes, Leila sleeps beneath the wave,
    But his shall be a redder grave;
    Her spirit pointed well the steel
    Which taught that felon heart to feel.
    He called the Prophet, but his power
    Was vain against the vengeful Giaour:
    He called on Alla--but the word
    Arose unheeded or unheard.
    Thou Paynim fool! could Leila's prayer
    Be passed, and thine accorded there?
    I watched my time, I leagued with these,
    The traitor in his turn to seize;
    My wrath is wreaked, the deed is done,
    And now I go--but go alone."

      The browsing camels' bells are tinkling:
    His mother looked from her lattice high--
      She saw the dews of eve besprinkling
    The pasture green beneath her eye,
      She saw the planets faintly twinkling:
    "'Tis twilight--sure his train is nigh."
    She could not rest in the garden-bower,
    But gazed through the grate of his steepest tower.
    "Why comes he not? his steeds are fleet,
    Nor shrink they from the summer heat;
    Why sends not the Bridegroom his promised gift?
    Is his heart more cold, or his barb less swift?
    Oh, false reproach! yon Tartar now
    Has gained our nearest mountain's brow,
    And warily the steep descends,
    And now within the valley bends;
    And he bears the gift at his saddle bow--
    How could I deem his courser slow?
    Right well my largess shall repay
    His welcome speed, and weary way."

      The Tartar lighted at the gate,
    But scarce upheld his fainting weight!
    His swarthy visage spake distress,
    But this might be from weariness;
    His garb with sanguine spots was dyed,
    But these might be from his courser's side;
    He drew the token from his vest--
    Angel of Death! 'tis Hassan's cloven crest!
    His calpac rent--his caftan red--
    "Lady, a fearful bride thy Son hath wed:
    Me, not from mercy, did they spare,
    But this empurpled pledge to bear.
    Peace to the brave! whose blood is spilt:
    Woe to the Giaour! for his the guilt."

      A Turban carved in coarsest stone,
    A Pillar with rank weeds o'ergrown,
    Whereon can now be scarcely read
    The Koran verse that mourns the dead,
    Point out the spot where Hassan fell
    A victim in that lonely dell.
    There sleeps as true an Osmanlie
    As e'er at Mecca bent the knee;
    As ever scorned forbidden wine,
    Or prayed with face towards the shrine,
    In orisons resumed anew
    At solemn sound of "Alla Hu!"
    Yet died he by a stranger's hand,
    And stranger in his native land;
    Yet died he as in arms he stood,
    And unavenged, at least in blood.
    But him the maids of Paradise
      Impatient to their halls invite,
    And the dark heaven of Houris' eyes
      On him shall glance for ever bright;
    They come--their kerchiefs green they wave,
    And welcome with a kiss the brave!
    Who falls in battle 'gainst a Giaour
    Is worthiest an immortal bower.

      But thou, false Infidel! shall writhe
    Beneath avenging Monkir's scythe;
    And from its torments 'scape alone
    To wander round lost Eblis' throne;
    And fire unquenched, unquenchable,
    Around, within, thy heart shall dwell;
    Nor ear can hear nor tongue can tell
    The tortures of that inward hell!
    But first, on earth as Vampire sent,
    Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent:
    Then ghastly haunt thy native place,
    And suck the blood of all thy race;
    There from thy daughter, sister, wife,
    At midnight drain the stream of life;
    Yet loathe the banquet which perforce
    Must feed thy livid living corse:
    Thy victims ere they yet expire
    Shall know the demon for their sire,
    As cursing thee, thou cursing them,
    Thy flowers are withered on the stem.
    But one that for thy crime must fall,
    The youngest, most beloved of all,
    Shall bless thee with a father's name--
    That word shall wrap thy heart in flame!
    Yet must thou end thy task, and mark
    Her cheek's last tinge, her eye's last spark,
    And the last glassy glance must view
    Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue;
    Then with unhallowed hand shalt tear
    The tresses of her yellow hair,
    Of which in life a lock when shorn
    Affection's fondest pledge was worn,
    But now is borne away by thee,
    Memorial of thine agony!
    Wet with thine own best blood shall drip
    Thy gnashing tooth and haggard lip;
    Then stalking to thy sullen grave,
    Go--and with Gouls and Afrits rave;
    Till these in horror shrink away
    From Spectre more accursed than they!

    "How name ye yon lone Caloyer?
      His features I have scanned before
    In mine own land: 'tis many a year,
      Since, dashing by the lonely shore,
    I saw him urge as fleet a steed
    As ever served a horseman's need.
    But once I saw that face, yet then
    It was so marked with inward pain,
    I could not pass it by again;
    It breathes the same dark spirit now,
    As death were stamped upon his brow.

    "'Tis twice three years at summer tide
      Since first among our freres he came;
    And here it soothes him to abide
      For some dark deed he will not name.
    But never at our Vesper prayer,
    Nor e'er before Confession chair
    Kneels he, nor recks he when arise
    Incense or anthem to the skies,
    But broods within his cell alone,
    His faith and race alike unknown.
    The sea from Paynim land he crost,
    And here ascended from the coast;
    Yet seems he not of Othman race,
    But only Christian in his face:
    I'd judge him some stray renegade,
    Repentant of the change he made,
    Save that he shuns our holy shrine,
    Nor tastes the sacred bread and wine.
    Great largess to these walls he brought,
    And thus our Abbot's favour bought;
    But were I Prior, not a day
    Should brook such stranger's further stay,
    Or pent within our penance cell
    Should doom him there for aye to dwell.
    Much in his visions mutters he
    Of maiden whelmed beneath the sea;
    Of sabres clashing, foemen flying,
    Wrongs avenged, and Moslem dying.
    On cliff he hath been known to stand,
    And rave as to some bloody hand
    Fresh severed from its parent limb,
    Invisible to all but him,
    Which beckons onward to his grave,
    And lures to leap into the wave."

      Dark and unearthly is the scowl
    That glares beneath his dusky cowl:
    The flash of that dilating eye
    Reveals too much of times gone by;
    Though varying, indistinct its hue,
    Oft with his glance the gazer rue,
    For in it lurks that nameless spell,
    Which speaks, itself unspeakable,
    A spirit yet unquelled and high,
    That claims and keeps ascendancy;
    And like the bird whose pinions quake,
    But cannot fly the gazing snake,
    Will others quail beneath his look,
    Nor 'scape the glance they scarce can brook.
    From him the half-affrighted Friar
    When met alone would fain retire,
    As if that eye and bitter smile
    Transferred to others fear and guile:
    Not oft to smile descendeth he,
    And when he doth 'tis sad to see
    That he but mocks at Misery.
    How that pale lip will curl and quiver!
    Then fix once more as if for ever;
    As if his sorrow or disdain
    Forbade him e'er to smile again.
    Well were it so--such ghastly mirth
    From joyaunce ne'er derived its birth.
    But sadder still it were to trace
    What once were feelings in that face:
    Time hath not yet the features fixed,
    But brighter traits with evil mixed;
    And there are hues not always faded,
    Which speak a mind not all degraded
    Even by the crimes through which it waded:
    The common crowd but see the gloom
    Of wayward deeds, and fitting doom;
    The close observer can espy
    A noble soul, and lineage high:
    Alas! though both bestowed in vain,
    Which Grief could change, and Guilt could stain,
    It was no vulgar tenement
    To which such lofty gifts were lent,
    And still with little less than dread
    On such the sight is riveted.
    The roofless cot, decayed and rent,
      Will scarce delay the passer-by;
    The tower by war or tempest bent,
    While yet may frown one battlement,
      Demands and daunts the stranger's eye;
    Each ivied arch, and pillar lone,
    Pleads haughtily for glories gone!
    "His floating robe around him folding,
      Slow sweeps he through the columned aisle;
    With dread beheld, with gloom beholding
      The rites that sanctify the pile.
    But when the anthem shakes the choir,
    And kneel the monks, his steps retire;
    By yonder lone and wavering torch
    His aspect glares within the porch;
    There will he pause till all is done--
    And hear the prayer, but utter none.
    See--by the half-illumined wall
    His hood fly back, his dark hair fall,
    That pale brow wildly wreathing round,
    As if the Gorgon there had bound
    The sablest of the serpent-braid
    That o'er her fearful forehead strayed:
    For he declines the convent oath,
    And leaves those locks unhallowed growth,
    But wears our garb in all beside;
    And, not from piety but pride,
    Gives wealth to walls that never heard
    Of his one holy vow nor word.
    Lo!--mark ye, as the harmony
    Peals louder praises to the sky,
    That livid cheek, that stony air
    Of mixed defiance and despair!
    Saint Francis, keep him from the shrine!
    Else may we dread the wrath divine
    Made manifest by awful sign.
    If ever evil angel bore
    The form of mortal, such he wore;
    By all my hope of sins forgiven,
    Such looks are not of earth nor heaven!"

      To Love the softest hearts are prone,
    But such can ne'er be all his own;
    Too timid in his woes to share,
    Too meek to meet, or brave despair;
    And sterner hearts alone may feel
    The wound that Time can never heal.
    The rugged metal of the mine
    Must burn before its surface shine,
    But plunged within the furnace-flame,
    It bends and melts--though still the same;
    Then tempered to thy want, or will,
    'Twill serve thee to defend or kill--
    A breast-plate for thine hour of need,
    Or blade to bid thy foeman bleed;
    But if a dagger's form it bear,
    Let those who shape its edge, beware!
    Thus Passion's fire, and Woman's art,
    Can turn and tame the sterner heart;
    From these its form and tone are ta'en,
    And what they make it, must remain,
    But break--before it bend again.

      If solitude succeed to grief,
    Release from pain is slight relief;
    The vacant bosom's wilderness
    Might thank the pang that made it less.
    We loathe what none are left to share:
    Even bliss--'twere woe alone to bear;
    The heart once left thus desolate
    Must fly at last for ease--to hate.
    It is as if the dead could feel
    The icy worm around them steal,
    And shudder, as the reptiles creep
    To revel o'er their rotting sleep,
    Without the power to scare away
    The cold consumers of their clay!
    It is as if the desert bird,
      Whose beak unlocks her bosom's stream
      To still her famished nestlings' scream,
    Nor mourns a life to them transferred,
    Should rend her rash devoted breast,
    And find them flown her empty nest.
    The keenest pangs the wretched find
      Are rapture to the dreary void,
    The leafless desert of the mind,
      The waste of feelings unemployed.
    Who would be doomed to gaze upon
    A sky without a cloud or sun?
    Less hideous far the tempest's roar,
    Than ne'er to brave the billows more--
    Thrown, when the war of winds is o'er,
    A lonely wreck on Fortune's shore,
    'Mid sullen calm, and silent bay,
    Unseen to drop by dull decay;--
    Better to sink beneath the shock
    Than moulder piecemeal on the rock!

      "Father! thy, days have passed in peace,
        'Mid counted beads, and countless prayer;
      To bid the sins of others cease,
        Thyself without a crime or care,
      Save transient ills that all must bear,
      Has been thy lot from youth to age;
      And thou wilt bless thee from the rage
      Of passions fierce and uncontrolled,
      Such as thy penitents unfold,
      Whose secret sins and sorrows rest
      Within thy pure and pitying breast.
      My days, though few, have passed below
      In much of Joy, but more of Woe;
      Yet still in hours of love or strife,
      I've 'scaped the weariness of Life:
      Now leagued with friends, now girt by foes,
      I loathed the languor of repose.
      Now nothing left to love or hate,
      No more with hope or pride elate,
      I'd rather be the thing that crawls
      Most noxious o'er a dungeon's walls,
      Than pass my dull, unvarying days,
      Condemned to meditate and gaze.
      Yet, lurks a wish within my breast
      For rest--but not to feel 'tis rest.
      Soon shall my Fate that wish fulfil;
        And I shall sleep without the dream
      Of what I was, and would be still
        Dark as to thee my deeds may seem:
      My memory now is but the tomb
      Of joys long dead; my hope, their doom:
      'Though better to have died with those
      Than bear a life of lingering woes.
      My spirit shrunk not to sustain
      The searching throes of ceaseless pain;
      Nor sought the self-accorded grave
      Of ancient fool and modern knave:
      Yet death I have not feared to meet;
      And in the field it had been sweet,
      Had Danger wooed me on to move
      The slave of Glory, not of Love.
      I've braved it--not for Honour's boast;
      I smile at laurels won or lost;
      To such let others carve their way,
      For high renown, or hireling pay:
      But place again before my eyes
      Aught that I deem a worthy prize--
      The maid I love, the man I hate--
      And I will hunt the steps of fate,
      To save or slay, as these require,
      Through rending steel, and rolling fire:
      Nor needst thou doubt this speech from one
      Who would but do--what he hath done.
      Death is but what the haughty brave,
      The weak must bear, the wretch must crave;
      Then let life go to Him who gave:
      I have not quailed to Danger's brow
      When high and happy--need I now?

      "I loved her, Friar! nay, adored--
        But these are words that all can use--
      I proved it more in deed than word;
      There's blood upon that dinted sword,
        A stain its steel can never lose:
      'Twas shed for her, who died for me,
        It warmed the heart of one abhorred:
      Nay, start not--no--nor bend thy knee,
        Nor midst my sin such act record;
      Thou wilt absolve me from the deed,
      For he was hostile to thy creed!
      The very name of Nazarene
      Was wormwood to his Paynim spleen.
      Ungrateful fool! since but for brands
      Well wielded in some hardy hands,
      And wounds by Galileans given--
      The surest pass to Turkish heaven--
      For him his Houris still might wait
      Impatient at the Prophet's gate.
      I loved her--Love will find its way
      Through paths where wolves would fear to prey;
      And if it dares enough,'twere hard
      If Passion met not some reward--
      No matter how, or where, or why,
      I did not vainly seek, nor sigh:
      Yet sometimes, with remorse, in vain
      I wish she had not loved again.
      She died--I dare not tell thee how;
      But look--'tis written on my brow!
      There read of Cain the curse and crime,
      In characters unworn by Time:
      Still, ere thou dost condemn me, pause;
      Not mine the act, though I the cause.
      Yet did he but what I had done
      Had she been false to more than one.
      Faithless to him--he gave the blow;
      But true to me--I laid him low:
      Howe'er deserved her doom might be,
      Her treachery was truth to me;
      To me she gave her heart, that all
      Which Tyranny can ne'er enthrall;
      And I, alas! too late to save!
      Yet all I then could give, I gave--
      'Twas some relief--our foe a grave.
      His death sits lightly; but her fate
      Has made me--what thou well mayst hate.
        His doom was sealed--he knew it well,
      Warned by the voice of stern Taheer,
      Deep in whose darkly boding ear
      The deathshot pealed of murder near,
        As filed the troop to where they fell!
      He died too in the battle broil,
      A time that heeds nor pain nor toil;
      One cry to Mahomet for aid,
      One prayer to Alla all he made:
      He knew and crossed me in the fray--
      I gazed upon him where he lay,
      And watched his spirit ebb away:
      Though pierced like pard by hunter's steel,
      He felt not half that now I feel.
      I searched, but vainly searched, to find
      The workings of a wounded mind;
      Each feature of that sullen corse
      Betrayed his rage, but no remorse.
      Oh, what had Vengeance given to trace
      Despair upon his dying face!
      The late repentance of that hour
      When Penitence hath lost her power
      To tear one terror from the grave,
      And will not soothe, and cannot save.

      "The cold in clime are cold in blood,
      Their love can scarce deserve the name;
      But mine was like the lava flood
        That boils in Aetna's breast of flame.
      I cannot prate in puling strain
      Of Ladye-love, and Beauty's chain:
      If changing cheek, and scorching vein,
      Lips taught to writhe, but not complain,
      If bursting heart, and maddening brain,
      And daring deed, and vengeful steel,
      And all that I have felt, and feel,
      Betoken love--that love was mine,
      And shown by many a bitter sign.
      'Tis true, I could not whine nor sigh,
      I knew but to obtain or die.
      I die--but first I have possessed,
      And come what may, I have been blessed.
      Shall I the doom I sought upbraid?
      No--reft of all, yet undismayed
      But for the thought of Leila slain,
      Give me the pleasure with the pain,
      So would I live and love again.
      I grieve, but not, my holy Guide!
      For him who dies, but her who died:
      She sleeps beneath the wandering wave--
      Ah! had she but an earthly grave,
      This breaking heart and throbbing head
      Should seek and share her narrow bed.
      She was a form of Life and Light,
      That, seen, became a part of sight;
      And rose, where'er I turned mine eye,
      The Morning-star of Memory!

      "Yes, Love indeed is light from heaven;
        A spark of that immortal fire
      With angels shared, by Alia given,
        To lift from earth our low desire.
      Devotion wafts the mind above,
      But Heaven itself descends in Love;
      A feeling from the Godhead caught,
      To wean from self each sordid thought;
      A ray of Him who formed the whole;
      A Glory circling round the soul!
      I grant my love imperfect, all
      That mortals by the name miscall;
      Then deem it evil, what thou wilt;
      But say, oh say, hers was not Guilt!
      She was my Life's unerring Light:
      That quenched--what beam shall break my night?
      Oh! would it shone to lead me still,
      Although to death or deadliest ill!
      Why marvel ye, if they who lose
        This present joy, this future hope,
        No more with Sorrow meekly cope;
      In phrensy then their fate accuse;
      In madness do those fearful deeds
        That seem to add but Guilt to Woe?
      Alas! the breast that inly bleeds
        Hath nought to dread from outward blow:
      Who falls from all he knows of bliss,
      Cares little into what abyss.
      Fierce as the gloomy vulture's now
        To thee, old man, my deeds appear:
      I read abhorrence on thy brow,
        And this too was I born to bear!
      'Tis true, that, like that bird of prey,
      With havock have I marked my way:
      But this was taught me by the dove,
      To die--and know no second love.
      This lesson yet hath man to learn,
      Taught by the thing he dares to spurn:
      The bird that sings within the brake,
      The swan that swims upon the lake,
      One mate, and one alone, will take.
      And let the fool still prone to range,
      And sneer on all who cannot change,
      Partake his jest with boasting boys;
      I envy not his varied joys,
      But deem such feeble, heartless man,
      Less than yon solitary swan;
      Far, far beneath the shallow maid
      He left believing and betrayed.
      Such shame at least was never mine--
      Leila! each thought was only thine!
      My good, my guilt, my weal, my woe,
      My hope on high--my all below.
      Each holds no other like to thee,
      Or, if it doth, in vain for me:
      For worlds I dare not view the dame
      Resembling thee, yet not the same.
      The very crimes that mar my youth,
      This bed of death--attest my truth!
      'Tis all too late--thou wert, thou art
      The cherished madness of my heart!

      "And she was lost--and yet I breathed,
        But not the breath of human life:
      A serpent round my heart was wreathed,
        And stung my every thought to strife.
      Alike all time, abhorred all place,
      Shuddering I shrank from Nature's face,
      Where every hue that charmed before
      The blackness of my bosom wore.
      The rest thou dost already know,
      And all my sins, and half my woe.
      But talk no more of penitence;
      Thou seest I soon shall part from hence:
      And if thy holy tale were true,
      The deed that's done canst thou undo?
      Think me not thankless--but this grief
      Looks not to priesthood for relief.
      My soul's estate in secret guess:
      But wouldst thou pity more, say less.
      When thou canst bid my Leila live,
      Then will I sue thee to forgive;
      Then plead my cause in that high place
      Where purchased masses proffer grace.
      Go, when the hunter's hand hath wrung
      From forest-cave her shrieking young,
      And calm the lonely lioness:
    But soothe not--mock not my distress!

      "In earlier days, and calmer hours,
        When heart with heart delights to blend,
      Where bloom my native valley's bowers,
        I had--Ah! have I now?--a friend!
      To him this pledge I charge thee send,
        Memorial of a youthful vow;
      I would remind him of my end:
        Though souls absorbed like mine allow
      Brief thought to distant Friendship's claim,
      Yet dear to him my blighted name.
      'Tis strange--he prophesied my doom,
        And I have smiled--I then could smile--
      When Prudence would his voice assume,
        And warn--I recked not what--the while:
      But now Remembrance whispers o'er
      Those accents scarcely marked before.
      Say--that his bodings came to pass,
        And he will start to hear their truth,
        And wish his words had not been sooth:
      Tell him--unheeding as I was,
        Through many a busy bitter scene
        Of all our golden youth had been,
      In pain, my faltering tongue had tried
      To bless his memory--ere I died;
      But Heaven in wrath would turn away,
      If Guilt should for the guiltless pray.
      I do not ask him not to blame,
      Too gentle he to wound my name;
      And what have I to do with Fame?
      I do not ask him not to mourn,
      Such cold request might sound like scorn;
      And what than Friendship's manly tear
      May better grace a brother's bier?
      But bear this ring, his own of old,
      And tell him--what thou dost behold!
      The withered frame, the ruined mind,
      The wrack by passion left behind,
      A shrivelled scroll, a scattered leaf,
      Seared by the autumn blast of Grief!

        "Tell me no more of Fancy's gleam,
      No, father, no,'twas not a dream;
      Alas! the dreamer first must sleep,
      I only watched, and wished to weep;
      But could not, for my burning brow
      Throbbed to the very brain as now:
      I wished but for a single tear,
      As something welcome, new, and dear:
      I wished it then, I wish it still;
      Despair is stronger than my will.
      Waste not thine orison, despair
      Is mightier than thy pious prayer:
      I would not, if I might, be blest;
      I want no Paradise, but rest.
      'Twas then--I tell thee--father! then
      I saw her; yes, she lived again;
      And shining in her white symar
      As through yon pale gray cloud the star
      Which now I gaze on, as on her,
      Who looked and looks far lovelier;
      Dimly I view its trembling spark;
      To-morrow's night shall be more dark;
      And I, before its rays appear,
      That lifeless thing the living fear.
      I wander--father! for my soul
      Is fleeting towards the final goal.
      I saw her--friar! and I rose
      Forgetful of our former woes;
      And rushing from my couch, I dart,
      And clasp her to my desperate heart;
      I clasp--what is it that I clasp?
      No breathing form within my grasp,
      No heart that beats reply to mine--
      Yet, Leila! yet the form is thine!
      And art thou, dearest, changed so much
      As meet my eye, yet mock my touch?
      Ah! were thy beauties e'er so cold,
      I care not--so my arms enfold
      The all they ever wished to hold.
      Alas! around a shadow prest
      They shrink upon my lonely breast;
      Yet still 'tis there! In silence stands,
      And beckons with beseeching hands!
      With braided hair, and bright-black eye--
      I knew 'twas false--she could not die!
      But he is dead! within the dell
      I saw him buried where he fell;
      He comes not--for he cannot break
      From earth;--why then art thou awake?
      They told me wild waves rolled above
      The face I view--the form I love;
      They told me--'twas a hideous tale!--
      I'd tell it, but my tongue would fail:
      If true, and from thine ocean-cave
      Thou com'st to claim a calmer grave,
      Oh! pass thy dewy fingers o'er
      This brow that then will burn no more;
      Or place them on my hopeless heart:
      But, Shape or Shade! whate'er thou art,
      In mercy ne'er again depart!
      Or farther with thee bear my soul
      Than winds can waft or waters roll!

      "Such is my name, and such my tale.
        Confessor! to thy secret ear
      I breathe the sorrows I bewail,
        And thank thee for the generous tear
      This glazing eye could never shed.
      Then lay me with the humblest dead,
      And, save the cross above my head,
      Be neither name nor emblem spread,
      By prying stranger to be read,
      Or stay the passing pilgrim's tread."

    He passed--nor of his name and race
    He left a token or a trace,
    Save what the Father must not say
    Who shrived him on his dying day:
    This broken tale was all we knew
    Of her he loved, or him he slew.

                   "Had we never loved sae kindly,
                    Had we never loved sae blindly,
                    Never met--or never parted,
                    We had ne'er been broken-hearted."--

    Know ye the land where the cypress and myrtle
      Are emblems of deeds that are done in their clime?
    Where the rage of the vulture, the love of the turtle,
      Now melt into sorrow, now madden to crime?
    Know ye the land of the cedar and vine,
    Where the flowers ever blossom, the beams ever shine;
    Where the light wings of Zephyr, oppressed with perfume,
    Wax faint o'er the gardens of Gul in her bloom;
    Where the citron and olive are fairest of fruit,
    And the voice of the nightingale never is mute;
    Where the tints of the earth, and the hues of the sky,
    In colour though varied, in beauty may vie,
    And the purple of Ocean is deepest in dye;
    Where the virgins are soft as the roses they twine,
    And all, save the spirit of man, is divine--
    Tis the clime of the East--'tis the land of the Sun--
    Can he smile on such deeds as his children have done?
    Oh! wild as the accents of lovers' farewell
    Are the hearts which they bear, and the tales which they tell.

                    II.

        Begirt with many a gallant slave,
        Apparelled as becomes the brave,
        Awaiting each his Lord's behest
        To guide his steps, or guard his rest,
        Old Giaffir sate in his Divan:
          Deep thought was in his aged eye;
        And though the face of Mussulman
          Not oft betrays to standers by
      The mind within, well skilled to hide
      All but unconquerable pride,
      His pensive cheek and pondering brow
      Did more than he was wont avow.

                    III.

    "Let the chamber be cleared."--The train disappeared--
      "Now call me the chief of the Haram guard"--
    With Giaffir is none but his only son,
      And the Nubian awaiting the sire's award.
      "Haroun--when all the crowd that wait
      Are passed beyond the outer gate,
      (Woe to the head whose eye beheld
      My child Zuleika's face unveiled!)
      Hence, lead my daughter from her tower--
      Her fate is fixed this very hour;
      Yet not to her repeat my thought--
      By me alone be duty taught!"

      "Pacha! to hear is to obey."--
      No more must slave to despot say--
      Then to the tower had ta'en his way:
      But here young Selim silence brake,
        First lowly rendering reverence meet;
      And downcast looked, and gently spake,
        Still standing at the Pacha's feet:
      For son of Moslem must expire,
      Ere dare to sit before his sire!
      "Father! for fear that thou shouldst chide
      My sister, or her sable guide--
      Know--for the fault, if fault there be,
      Was mine--then fall thy frowns on me!
      So lovelily the morning shone,
        That--let the old and weary sleep--
      I could not; and to view alone
        The fairest scenes of land and deep,
      With none to listen and reply
      To thoughts with which my heart beat high
      Were irksome--for whate'er my mood,
      In sooth I love not solitude;
      I on Zuleika's slumber broke,
        And, as thou knowest that for me
        Soon turns the Haram's grating key,
      Before the guardian slaves awoke
      We to the cypress groves had flown,
      And made earth, main, and heaven our own!
      There lingered we, beguiled too long
      With Mejnoun's tale, or Sadi's song;
      Till I, who heard the deep tambour
      Beat thy Divan's approaching hour,
      To thee, and to my duty true,
      Warned by the sound, to greet thee flew:
      But there Zuleika wanders yet--
      Nay, Father, rage not--nor forget
      That none can pierce that secret bower
      But those who watch the women's tower."

                    IV.

    "Son of a slave"--the Pacha said--
    "From unbelieving mother bred,
    Vain were a father's hope to see
    Aught that beseems a man in thee.
    Thou, when thine arm should bend the bow,
      And hurl the dart, and curb the steed,
      Thou, Greek in soul if not in creed,
    Must pore where babbling waters flow,
    And watch unfolding roses blow.
    Would that yon Orb, whose matin glow
    Thy listless eyes so much admire,
    Would lend thee something of his fire!
    Thou, who woulds't see this battlement
    By Christian cannon piecemeal rent;
    Nay, tamely view old Stambol's wall
    Before the dogs of Moscow fall,
    Nor strike one stroke for life and death
    Against the curs of Nazareth!
    Go--let thy less than woman's hand
    Assume the distaff--not the brand.
    But, Haroun!--to my daughter speed:
    And hark--of thine own head take heed--
    If thus Zuleika oft takes wing--
    Thou see'st yon bow--it hath a string!"

                    V.

    No sound from Selim's lip was heard,
      At least that met old Giaffir's ear,
    But every frown and every word
    Pierced keener than a Christian's sword.
      "Son of a slave!--reproached with fear!
      Those gibes had cost another dear.
    Son of a slave!--and who my Sire?"
      Thus held his thoughts their dark career;
    And glances ev'n of more than ire
      Flash forth, then faintly disappear.
    Old Giaffir gazed upon his son
      And started; for within his eye
    He read how much his wrath had done;
    He saw rebellion there begun:
      "Come hither, boy--what, no reply?
    I mark thee--and I know thee too;
    But there be deeds thou dar'st not do:
    But if thy beard had manlier length,
    And if thy hand had skill and strength,
    I'd joy to see thee break a lance,
    Albeit against my own perchance."
    As sneeringly these accents fell,
    On Selim's eye he fiercely gazed:
      That eye returned him glance for glance,
    And proudly to his Sire's was raised,
      Till Giaffir's quailed and shrunk askance--
    And why--he felt, but durst not tell.
    "Much I misdoubt this wayward boy
    Will one day work me more annoy:
    I never loved him from his birth,
    And--but his arm is little worth,
    And scarcely in the chase could cope
    With timid fawn or antelope,
    Far less would venture into strife
    Where man contends for fame and life--
      I would not trust that look or tone:
    No--nor the blood so near my own.
    That blood--he hath not heard--no more--
    I'll watch him closer than before.
    He is an Arab to my sight,
    Or Christian crouching in the fight--
    But hark!--I hear Zuleika's voice;
      Like Houris' hymn it meets mine ear:
    She is the offspring of my choice;
      Oh! more than ev'n her mother dear,
    With all to hope, and nought to fear--
    My Peri! ever welcome here!
    Sweet, as the desert fountain's wave
    To lips just cooled in time to save--
      Such to my longing sight art thou;
    Nor can they waft to Mecca's shrine
    More thanks for life, than I for thine,
      Who blest thy birth and bless thee now."

                    VI.

    Fair, as the first that fell of womankind,
      When on that dread yet lovely serpent smiling,
    Whose Image then was stamped upon her mind--
      But once beguiled--and ever more beguiling;
    Dazzling, as that, oh! too transcendent vision
      To Sorrow's phantom-peopled slumber given,
    When heart meets heart again in dreams Elysian,
      And paints the lost on Earth revived in Heaven;
    Soft, as the memory of buried love;
    Pure, as the prayer which Childhood wafts above;
    Was she--the daughter of that rude old Chief,
    Who met the maid with tears--but not of grief.

    Who hath not proved how feebly words essay
    To fix one spark of Beauty's heavenly ray?
    Who doth not feel, until his failing sight
    Faints into dimness with its own delight,
    His changing cheek, his sinking heart confess
    The might--the majesty of Loveliness?
    Such was Zuleika--such around her shone
    The nameless charms unmarked by her alone--
    The light of Love, the purity of Grace,
    The mind, the Music breathing from her face,
    The heart whose softness harmonized the whole,
    And oh! that eye was in itself a Soul!

    Her graceful arms in meekness bending
      Across her gently-budding breast;
    At one kind word those arms extending
      To clasp the neck of him who blest
      His child caressing and carest,
      Zuleika came--and Giaffir felt
      His purpose half within him melt:
      Not that against her fancied weal
      His heart though stern could ever feel;
      Affection chained her to that heart;
      Ambition tore the links apart.

                    VII.

    "Zuleika! child of Gentleness!
      How dear this very day must tell,
    When I forget my own distress,
      In losing what I love so well,
    To bid thee with another dwell:
    Another! and a braver man
    Was never seen in battle's van.
    We Moslem reck not much of blood:
      But yet the line of Carasman
    Unchanged, unchangeable hath stood
      First of the bold Timariot bands
    That won and well can keep their lands.
    Enough that he who comes to woo
    Is kinsman of the Bey Oglou:
    His years need scarce a thought employ;
    I would not have thee wed a boy.
    And thou shalt have a noble dower:
    And his and my united power
    Will laugh to scorn the death-firman,
    Which others tremble but to scan,
    And teach the messenger what fate
    The bearer of such boon may wait.
    And now thou know'st thy father's will;
      All that thy sex hath need to know:
    'Twas mine to teach obedience still--
      The way to love, thy Lord may show."

                    VIII.

      In silence bowed the virgin's head;
        And if her eye was filled with tears
      That stifled feeling dare not shed,
      And changed her cheek from pale to red,
        And red to pale, as through her ears
      Those winged words like arrows sped,
        What could such be but maiden fears?
      So bright the tear in Beauty's eye,
      Love half regrets to kiss it dry;
      So sweet the blush of Bashfulness,
      Even Pity scarce can wish it less!

      Whate'er it was the sire forgot:
      Or if remembered, marked it not;
      Thrice clapped his hands, and called his steed,
        Resigned his gem-adorned chibouque,
      And mounting featly for the mead,
        With Maugrabeel and Mamaluke,
        His way amid his Delis took,
      To witness many an active deed
      With sabre keen, or blunt jerreed.
      The Kislar only and his Moors
      Watch well the Haram's massy doors.

                    IX.

    His head was leant upon his hand,
      His eye looked o'er the dark blue water
    That swiftly glides and gently swells
    Between the winding Dardanelles;
    But yet he saw nor sea nor strand,
    Nor even his Pacha's turbaned band
      Mix in the game of mimic slaughter,
    Careering cleave the folded felt
    With sabre stroke right sharply dealt;
    Nor marked the javelin-darting crowd,
    Nor heard their Ollahs wild and loud--
      He thought but of old Giaffir's daughter!

                    X.

    No word from Selim's bosom broke;
    One sigh Zuleika's thought bespoke:
    Still gazed he through the lattice grate,
    Pale, mute, and mournfully sedate.
    To him Zuleika's eye was turned,
    But little from his aspect learned:
    Equal her grief, yet not the same;
    Her heart confessed a gentler flame:
    But yet that heart, alarmed or weak,
    She knew not why, forbade to speak.
    Yet speak she must--but when essay?
    "How strange he thus should turn away!
    Not thus we e'er before have met;
    Not thus shall be our parting yet."
    Thrice paced she slowly through the room,
      And watched his eye--it still was fixed:
      She snatched the urn wherein was mixed
    The Persian Atar-gul's perfume,
    And sprinkled all its odours o'er
    The pictured roof and marble floor:
    The drops, that through his glittering vest
    The playful girl's appeal addressed,
    Unheeded o'er his bosom flew,
    As if that breast were marble too.
    "What, sullen yet? it must not be--
    Oh! gentle Selim, this from thee!"
    She saw in curious order set
      The fairest flowers of Eastern land--
    "He loved them once; may touch them yet,
      If offered by Zuleika's hand."
    The childish thought was hardly breathed
    Before the rose was plucked and wreathed;
    The next fond moment saw her seat
    Her fairy form at Selim's feet:
    "This rose to calm my brother's cares
    A message from the Bulbul bears;
    It says to-night he will prolong
    For Selim's ear his sweetest song;
    And though his note is somewhat sad,
    He'll try for once a strain more glad,
    With some faint hope his altered lay
    May sing these gloomy thoughts away.

                    XI.

      "What! not receive my foolish flower?
        Nay then I am indeed unblest:
      On me can thus thy forehead lower?
        And know'st thou not who loves thee best?
      Oh, Selim dear! oh, more than dearest!
      Say, is it me thou hat'st or fearest?
      Come, lay thy head upon my breast,
      And I will kiss thee into rest,
      Since words of mine, and songs must fail,
      Ev'n from my fabled nightingale.
      I knew our sire at times was stern,
      But this from thee had yet to learn:
      Too well I know he loves thee not;
      But is Zuleika's love forgot?
      Ah! deem I right? the Pacha's plan--
      This kinsman Bey of Carasman
      Perhaps may prove some foe of thine.
      If so, I swear by Mecca's shrine,--
      If shrines that ne'er approach allow
      To woman's step admit her vow,--
      Without thy free consent--command--
      The Sultan should not have my hand!
      Think'st thou that I could bear to part
      With thee, and learn to halve my heart?
      Ah! were I severed from thy side,
      Where were thy friend--and who my guide?
      Years have not seen, Time shall not see,
      The hour that tears my soul from thee:
      Ev'n Azrael, from his deadly quiver
        When flies that shaft, and fly it must,
      That parts all else, shall doom for ever
        Our hearts to undivided dust!"

                    XII.

    He lived--he breathed--he moved--he felt;
    He raised the maid from where she knelt;
    His trance was gone, his keen eye shone
    With thoughts that long in darkness dwelt;
    With thoughts that burn--in rays that melt.
    As the stream late concealed
      By the fringe of its willows,
    When it rushes reveal'd
      In the light of its billows;
    As the bolt bursts on high
      From the black cloud that bound it,
    Flashed the soul of that eye
      Through the long lashes round it.
    A war-horse at the trumpet's sound,
    A lion roused by heedless hound,
    A tyrant waked to sudden strife
    By graze of ill-directed knife,
    Starts not to more convulsive life
    Than he, who heard that vow, displayed,
    And all, before repressed, betrayed:
    "Now thou art mine, for ever mine,
    With life to keep, and scarce with life resign;
    Now thou art mine, that sacred oath,
    Though sworn by one, hath bound us both.
    Yes, fondly, wisely hast thou done;
    That vow hath saved more heads than one:
    But blench not thou--thy simplest tress
    Claims more from me than tenderness;
    I would not wrong the slenderest hair
    That clusters round thy forehead fair,
    For all the treasures buried far
    Within the caves of Istakar.
    This morning clouds upon me lowered,
    Reproaches on my head were showered,
    And Giaffir almost called me coward!
    Now I have motive to be brave;
    The son of his neglected slave,
    Nay, start not,'twas the term he gave,
    May show, though little apt to vaunt,
    A heart his words nor deeds can daunt.
    His son, indeed!--yet, thanks to thee,
    Perchance I am, at least shall be;
    But let our plighted secret vow
    Be only known to us as now.
    I know the wretch who dares demand
    From Giaffir thy reluctant hand;
    More ill-got wealth, a meaner soul
    Holds not a Musselim's control;
    Was he not bred in Egripo?
    A viler race let Israel show!
    But let that pass--to none be told
    Our oath; the rest shall time unfold.
    To me and mine leave Osman Bey!
    I've partisans for Peril's day:
    Think not I am what I appear;
    I've arms--and friends--and vengeance near."

                    XIII.

    "Think not thou art what thou appearest!
      My Selim, thou art sadly changed:
    This morn I saw thee gentlest--dearest--
      But now thou'rt from thyself estranged.
    My love thou surely knew'st before,
    It ne'er was less--nor can be more.
    To see thee--hear thee--near thee stay--
      And hate the night--I know not why,
    Save that we meet not but by day;
      With thee to live, with thee to die,
      I dare not to my hope deny:
    Thy cheek--thine eyes--thy lips to kiss--
    Like this--and this--no more than this;
    For, Allah! sure thy lips are flame:
      What fever in thy veins is flushing?
    My own have nearly caught the same,
      At least I feel my cheek, too, blushing.
    To soothe thy sickness, watch thy health,
    Partake, but never waste thy wealth,
    Or stand with smiles unmurmuring by,
    And lighten half thy poverty;
    Do all but close thy dying eye,
    For that I could not live to try;
    To these alone my thoughts aspire:
    More can I do? or thou require?
    But, Selim, thou must answer why
    We need so much of mystery?
    The cause I cannot dream nor tell,
    But be it, since thou say'st 'tis well;
    Yet what thou mean'st by 'arms' and 'friends,'
    Beyond my weaker sense extends.
    I meant that Giaffir should have heard
      The very vow I plighted thee;
    His wrath would not revoke my word:
      But surely he would leave me free.
      Can this fond wish seem strange in me,
    To be what I have ever been?
    What other hath Zuleika seen
    From simple childhood's earliest hour?
      What other can she seek to see
    Than thee, companion of her bower,
      The partner of her infancy?
    These cherished thoughts with life begun,
      Say, why must I no more avow?
    What change is wrought to make me shun
      The truth--my pride, and thine till now?
    To meet the gaze of stranger's eyes
    Our law--our creed--our God denies;
    Nor shall one wandering thought of mine
    At such, our Prophet's will, repine:
    No! happier made by that decree,
    He left me all in leaving thee.
    Deep were my anguish, thus compelled
    To wed with one I ne'er beheld:
    This wherefore should I not reveal?
    Why wilt thou urge me to conceal?
    I know the Pacha's haughty mood
    To thee hath never boded good;
    And he so often storms at nought,
    Allah! forbid that e'er he ought!
    And why I know not, but within
    My heart concealment weighs like sin.
    If then such secrecy be crime,
      And such it feels while lurking here;
    Oh, Selim! tell me yet in time,
      Nor leave me thus to thoughts of fear.
    Ah! yonder see the Tchocadar,
    My father leaves the mimic war;
    I tremble now to meet his eye--
    Say, Selim, canst thou tell me why?"

                    XIV.

    "Zuleika--to thy tower's retreat
    Betake thee--Giaffir I can greet:
    And now with him I fain must prate
    Of firmans, imposts, levies, state.
    There's fearful news from Danube's banks,
    Our Vizier nobly thins his ranks
    For which the Giaour may give him thanks!
    Our Sultan hath a shorter way
    Such costly triumph to repay.
    But, mark me, when the twilight drum
      Hath warned the troops to food and sleep,
    Unto thy cell with Selim come;
      Then softly from the Haram creep
      Where we may wander by the deep:
      Our garden battlements are steep;
    Nor these will rash intruder climb
    To list our words, or stint our time;
    And if he doth, I want not steel
    Which some have felt, and more may feel.
    Then shalt thou learn of Selim more
    Than thou hast heard or thought before:
    Trust me, Zuleika--fear not me!
    Thou know'st I hold a Haram key."

    "Fear thee, my Selim! ne'er till now
    Did words like this----"

                            "Delay not thou;
    I keep the key--and Haroun's guard
    Have some, and hope of more reward.
    To-night, Zuleika, thou shalt hear
    My tale, my purpose, and my fear:
    I am not, love! what I appear."

                   CANTO THE SECOND.

                    I.

    The winds are high on Helle's wave,
      As on that night of stormy water
    When Love, who sent, forgot to save
    The young--the beautiful--the brave--
      The lonely hope of Sestos' daughter.
    Oh! when alone along the sky
    Her turret-torch was blazing high,
    Though rising gale, and breaking foam,
    And shrieking sea-birds warned him home;
    And clouds aloft and tides below,
    With signs and sounds, forbade to go,
    He could not see, he would not hear,
    Or sound or sign foreboding fear;
    His eye but saw that light of Love,
    The only star it hailed above;
    His ear but rang with Hero's song,
    "Ye waves, divide not lovers long!"--
    That tale is old, but Love anew
    May nerve young hearts to prove as true.

                    II.

    The winds are high and Helle's tide
      Rolls darkly heaving to the main;
    And Night's descending shadows hide
      That field with blood bedewed in vain,
    The desert of old Priam's pride;
      The tombs, sole relics of his reign,
    All--save immortal dreams that could beguile
    The blind old man of Scio's rocky isle!

                    III.

    Oh! yet--for there my steps have been;
      These feet have pressed the sacred shore,
    These limbs that buoyant wave hath borne--
    Minstrel! with thee to muse, to mourn,
      To trace again those fields of yore,
    Believing every hillock green
      Contains no fabled hero's ashes,
    And that around the undoubted scene
      Thine own "broad Hellespont" still dashes,
    Be long my lot! and cold were he
    Who there could gaze denying thee!

                    IV.

    The Night hath closed on Helle's stream,
      Nor yet hath risen on Ida's hill
    That Moon, which shone on his high theme:
    No warrior chides her peaceful beam,
      But conscious shepherds bless it still.
    Their flocks are grazing on the Mound
      Of him who felt the Dardan's arrow:
    That mighty heap of gathered ground
    Which Ammon's son ran proudly round,
    By nations raised, by monarchs crowned,
      Is now a lone and nameless barrow!
    Within--thy dwelling-place how narrow!
    Without--can only strangers breathe
    The name of him that was beneath:
    Dust long outlasts the storied stone;
    But Thou--thy very dust is gone!

                    V.

    Late, late to-night will Dian cheer
    The swain, and chase the boatman's fear;
    Till then--no beacon on the cliff
    May shape the course of struggling skiff;
    The scattered lights that skirt the bay,
    All, one by one, have died away;
    The only lamp of this lone hour
    Is glimmering in Zuleika's tower.
    Yes! there is light in that lone chamber,
      And o'er her silken ottoman
    Are thrown the fragrant beads of amber,
      O'er which her fairy fingers ran;
    Near these, with emerald rays beset,
    (How could she thus that gem forget?)
    Her mother's sainted amulet,
    Whereon engraved the Koorsee text,
    Could smooth this life, and win the next;
    And by her Comboloio lies
    A Koran of illumined dyes;
    And many a bright emblazoned rhyme
    By Persian scribes redeemed from Time;
    And o'er those scrolls, not oft so mute,
    Reclines her now neglected lute;
    And round her lamp of fretted gold
    Bloom flowers in urns of China's mould;
    The richest work of Iran's loom,
    And Sheeraz tribute of perfume;

    All that can eye or sense delight
      Are gathered in that gorgeous room:
      But yet it hath an air of gloom.
    She, of this Peri cell the sprite,
    What doth she hence, and on so rude a night?

                    VI.

    Wrapt in the darkest sable vest,
      Which none save noblest Moslem wear,
    To guard from winds of Heaven the breast
      As Heaven itself to Selim dear,
    With cautious steps the thicket threading,
      And starting oft, as through the glade
      The gust its hollow moanings made,
    Till on the smoother pathway treading,
    More free her timid bosom beat,
      The maid pursued her silent guide;
    And though her terror urged retreat,
      How could she quit her Selim's side?
      How teach her tender lips to chide?

                    VII.

    They reached at length a grotto, hewn
      By nature, but enlarged by art,
    Where oft her lute she wont to tune,
      And oft her Koran conned apart;
    And oft in youthful reverie
    She dreamed what Paradise might be:
    Where Woman's parted soul shall go
    Her Prophet had disdained to show;
    But Selim's mansion was secure,
    Nor deemed she, could he long endure
    His bower in other worlds of bliss
    Without her, most beloved in this!
    Oh! who so dear with him could dwell?
    What Houri soothe him half so well?

                    VIII.

    Since last she visited the spot
    Some change seemed wrought within the grot:
    It might be only that the night
    Disguised things seen by better light:
    That brazen lamp but dimly threw
    A ray of no celestial hue;
    But in a nook within the cell
    Her eye on stranger objects fell.
    There arms were piled, not such as wield
    The turbaned Delis in the field;
    But brands of foreign blade and hilt,
    And one was red--perchance with guilt!
    Ah! how without can blood be spilt?
    A cup too on the board was set
    That did not seem to hold sherbet.
    What may this mean? she turned to see
    Her Selim--"Oh! can this be he?"

                    IX.

    His robe of pride was thrown aside,
      His brow no high-crowned turban bore,
    But in its stead a shawl of red,
      Wreathed lightly round, his temples wore:
    That dagger, on whose hilt the gem
    Were worthy of a diadem,
    No longer glittered at his waist,
    Where pistols unadorned were braced;
    And from his belt a sabre swung,
    And from his shoulder loosely hung
    The cloak of white, the thin capote
    That decks the wandering Candiote;
    Beneath--his golden plated vest
    Clung like a cuirass to his breast;
    The greaves below his knee that wound
    With silvery scales were sheathed and bound.
    But were it not that high command
    Spake in his eye, and tone, and hand,
    All that a careless eye could see
    In him was some young Galiongee.

                    X.

    "I said I was not what I seemed;
      And now thou see'st my words were true:
    I have a tale thou hast not dreamed,
      If sooth--its truth must others rue.
    My story now 'twere vain to hide,
    I must not see thee Osman's bride:
    But had not thine own lips declared
    How much of that young heart I shared,
    I could not, must not, yet have shown
    The darker secret of my own.
    In this I speak not now of love;
    That--let Time--Truth--and Peril prove:
    But first--Oh! never wed another--
    Zuleika! I am not thy brother!"

                    XI.

    "Oh! not my brother!--yet unsay--
      God! am I left alone on earth
    To mourn--I dare not curse--the day
      That saw my solitary birth?
    Oh! thou wilt love me now no more!
      My sinking heart foreboded ill;
    But know me all I was before,
      Thy sister--friend--Zuleika still.
    Thou led'st me here perchance to kill;
      If thou hast cause for vengeance, see!
    My breast is offered--take thy fill!
      Far better with the dead to be
      Than live thus nothing now to thee:
    Perhaps far worse, for now I know
    Why Giaffir always seemed thy foe;
    And I, alas! am Giaffir's child,
    For whom thou wert contemned, reviled.
    If not thy sister--would'st thou save
    My life--Oh! bid me be thy slave!"

                    XII.

    "My slave, Zuleika!--nay, I'm thine:
      But, gentle love, this transport calm,
    Thy lot shall yet be linked with mine;
    I swear it by our Prophet's shrine,
      And be that thought thy sorrow's balm.
    So may the Koran verse displayed
    Upon its steel direct my blade,
    In danger's hour to guard us both,
    As I preserve that awful oath!
    The name in which thy heart hath prided
      Must change; but, my Zuleika, know,
    That tie is widened, not divided,
      Although thy Sire's my deadliest foe.
    My father was to Giaffir all
      That Selim late was deemed to thee;
    That brother wrought a brother's fall,
      But spared, at least, my infancy!
    And lulled me with a vain deceit
    That yet a like return may meet.
    He reared me, not with tender help,
      But like the nephew of a Cain;
    He watched me like a lion's whelp,
      That gnaws and yet may break his chain.
      My father's blood in every vein
    Is boiling! but for thy dear sake
    No present vengeance will I take;
      Though here I must no more remain.
    But first, beloved Zuleika! hear
    How Giaffir wrought this deed of fear.

                    XIII.

    "How first their strife to rancour grew,
      If Love or Envy made them foes,
    It matters little if I knew;
    In fiery spirits, slights, though few
      And thoughtless, will disturb repose.
    In war Abdallah's arm was strong,
      Remembered yet in Bosniac song,
    And Paswan's rebel hordes attest
    How little love they bore such guest:
    His death is all I need relate,
    The stern effect of Giaffir's hate;
    And how my birth disclosed to me,
    Whate'er beside it makes, hath made me free.

                    XIV.

    "When Paswan, after years of strife,
    At last for power, but first for life,
    In Widdin's walls too proudly sate,
    Our Pachas rallied round the state;
    Not last nor least in high command,
    Each brother led a separate band;
    They gave their Horse-tails to the wind,
      And mustering in Sophia's plain
    Their tents were pitched, their post assigned;
      To one, alas! assigned in vain!
    What need of words? the deadly bowl,
      By Giaffir's order drugged and given,
    With venom subtle as his soul,
      Dismissed Abdallah's hence to heaven.
    Reclined and feverish in the bath,
    He, when the hunter's sport was up,
    But little deemed a brother's wrath
      To quench his thirst had such a cup:
    The bowl a bribed attendant bore;
    He drank one draught, nor needed more!
    If thou my tale, Zuleika, doubt,
    Call Haroun--he can tell it out.

                    XV.

    "The deed once done, and Paswan's feud
    In part suppressed, though ne'er subdued,
      Abdallah's Pachalick was gained:--
    Thou know'st not what in our Divan
    Can wealth procure for worse than man--
      Abdallah's honours were obtained
    By him a brother's murder stained;
    'Tis true, the purchase nearly drained
    His ill-got treasure, soon replaced.
    Would'st question whence? Survey the waste,
    And ask the squalid peasant how
    His gains repay his broiling brow!--
    Why me the stern Usurper spared,
    Why thus with me his palace spared,
    I know not. Shame--regret--remorse--
    And little fear from infant's force--
    Besides, adoption as a son
    By him whom Heaven accorded none,
    Or some unknown cabal, caprice,
    Preserved me thus:--but not in peace:
    He cannot curb his haughty mood,
    Nor I forgive a father's blood.

                    XVI.

    "Within thy Father's house are foes;
      Not all who break his bread are true:
    To these should I my birth disclose,
      His days-his very hours were few:
    They only want a heart to lead,
    A hand to point them to the deed.
    But Haroun only knows, or knew
      This tale, whose close is almost nigh:
    He in Abdallah's palace grew,
      And held that post in his Serai
      Which holds he here--he saw him die;
    But what could single slavery do?
    Avenge his lord? alas! too late;
    Or save his son from such a fate?
    He chose the last, and when elate
      With foes subdued, or friends betrayed,
    Proud Giaffir in high triumph sate,
    He led me helpless to his gate,
      And not in vain it seems essayed
      To save the life for which he prayed.
    The knowledge of my birth secured
      From all and each, but most from me;
    Thus Giaffir's safety was ensured.
      Removed he too from Roumelie
    To this our Asiatic side,
    Far from our seats by Danube's tide,
      With none but Haroun, who retains
    Such knowledge--and that Nubian feels
      A Tyrant's secrets are but chains,
    From which the captive gladly steals,
    And this and more to me reveals:
    Such still to guilt just Allah sends--
    Slaves, tools, accomplices--no friends!

                    XVII.

    "All this, Zuleika, harshly sounds;
      But harsher still my tale must be:
    Howe'er my tongue thy softness wounds,
      Yet I must prove all truth to thee."
      I saw thee start this garb to see,
    Yet is it one I oft have worn,
      And long must wear: this Galiongee,
    To whom thy plighted vow is sworn,
      Is leader of those pirate hordes,
      Whose laws and lives are on their swords;
    To hear whose desolating tale
    Would make thy waning cheek more pale:
    Those arms thou see'st my band have brought,
    The hands that wield are not remote;
    This cup too for the rugged knaves
      Is filled--once quaffed, they ne'er repine:
    Our Prophet might forgive the slaves;
      They're only infidels in wine.

                    XVIII.

    "What could I be? Proscribed at home,
    And taunted to a wish to roam;
    And listless left--for Giaffir's fear
    Denied the courser and the spear--
    Though oft--Oh, Mahomet! how oft!--
    In full Divan the despot scoffed,
    As if my weak unwilling hand
    Refused the bridle or the brand:
    He ever went to war alone,
    And pent me here untried--unknown;
    To Haroun's care with women left,
    By hope unblest, of fame bereft,
    While thou--whose softness long endeared,
    Though it unmanned me, still had cheered--
    To Brusa's walls for safety sent,
    Awaited'st there the field's event.
    Haroun who saw my spirit pining
      Beneath inaction's sluggish yoke,
    His captive, though with dread resigning,
      My thraldom for a season broke,
    On promise to return before
    The day when Giaffir's charge was o'er.
    'Tis vain--my tongue can not impart
    My almost drunkenness of heart,
    When first this liberated eye
    Surveyed Earth--Ocean--Sun--and Sky--
    As if my Spirit pierced them through,
    And all their inmost wonders knew!
    One word alone can paint to thee
    That more than feeling--I was Free!
    E'en for thy presence ceased to pine;
    The World--nay, Heaven itself was mine!

                    XIX.

    "The shallop of a trusty Moor
    Conveyed me from this idle shore;
    I longed to see the isles that gem
    Old Ocean's purple diadem:
    I sought by turns, and saw them all;
      But when and where I joined the crew,
    With whom I'm pledged to rise or fall,
      When all that we design to do
    Is done,'twill then be time more meet
    To tell thee, when the tale's complete.

                    XX.

    "'Tis true, they are a lawless brood,
    But rough in form, nor mild in mood;
    And every creed, and every race,
    With them hath found--may find a place:
    But open speech, and ready hand,
    Obedience to their Chief's command;
    A soul for every enterprise,
    That never sees with Terror's eyes;
    Friendship for each, and faith to all,
    And vengeance vowed for those who fall,
    Have made them fitting instruments
    For more than e'en my own intents.
    And some--and I have studied all
      Distinguished from the vulgar rank,
    But chiefly to my council call
      The wisdom of the cautious Frank:--
    And some to higher thoughts aspire.
      The last of Lambro's patriots there
      Anticipated freedom share;
    And oft around the cavern fire
    On visionary schemes debate,
    To snatch the Rayahs from their fate.
    So let them ease their hearts with prate
    Of equal rights, which man ne'er knew;
    I have a love for freedom too.
    Aye! let me like the ocean-Patriarch roam,
    Or only know on land the Tartar's home!
    My tent on shore, my galley on the sea,
    Are more than cities and Serais to me:
    Borne by my steed, or wafted by my sail,
    Across the desert, or before the gale,
    Bound where thou wilt, my barb! or glide, my prow!
    But be the Star that guides the wanderer, Thou!
    Thou, my Zuleika, share and bless my bark;
    The Dove of peace and promise to mine ark!
    Or, since that hope denied in worlds of strife,
    Be thou the rainbow to the storms of life!
    The evening beam that smiles the clouds away,
    And tints to-morrow with prophetic ray!
    Blest--as the Muezzin's strain from Mecca's wall
    To pilgrims pure and prostrate at his call;
    Soft--as the melody of youthful days,
    That steals the trembling tear of speechless praise;
    Dear--as his native song to Exile's ears,
    Shall sound each tone thy long-loved voice endears.
    For thee in those bright isles is built a bower
    Blooming as Aden in its earliest hour.
    A thousand swords, with Selim's heart and hand,
    Wait--wave--defend--destroy--at thy command!
    Girt by my band, Zuleika at my side,
    The spoil of nations shall bedeck my bride.
    The Haram's languid years of listless ease
    Are well resigned for cares--for joys like these:
    Not blind to Fate, I see, where'er I rove,
    Unnumbered perils,--but one only love!
    Yet well my toils shall that fond breast repay,
    Though Fortune frown, or falser friends betray.
    How dear the dream in darkest hours of ill,
    Should all be changed, to find thee faithful still!
    Be but thy soul, like Selim's firmly shown;
    To thee be Selim's tender as thine own;
    To soothe each sorrow, share in each delight,
    Blend every thought, do all--but disunite!
    Once free, 'tis mine our horde again to guide;
    Friends to each other, foes to aught beside:
    Yet there we follow but the bent assigned
    By fatal Nature to man's warring kind:
    Mark! where his carnage and his conquests cease!
    He makes a solitude, and calls it--peace!
    I like the rest must use my skill or strength,
    But ask no land beyond my sabre's length:
    Power sways but by division--her resource
    The blest alternative of fraud or force!
    Ours be the last; in time Deceit may come
    When cities cage us in a social home:
    There ev'n thy soul might err--how oft the heart
    Corruption shakes which Peril could not part!
    And Woman, more than Man, when Death or Woe,
    Or even Disgrace, would lay her lover low,
    Sunk in the lap of Luxury will shame--
    Away suspicion!--not Zuleika's name!
    But life is hazard at the best; and here
    No more remains to win, and much to fear:
    Yes, fear!--the doubt, the dread of losing thee,
    By Osman's power, and Giaffir's stern decree.
    That dread shall vanish with the favouring gale,
    Which Love to-night hath promised to my sail:
    No danger daunts the pair his smile hath blest,
    Their steps still roving, but their hearts at rest.
    With thee all toils are sweet, each clime hath charms;
    Earth--sea alike--our world within our arms!
    Aye--let the loud winds whistle o'er the deck,
    So that those arms cling closer round my neck:
    The deepest murmur of this lip shall be,
    No sigh for safety, but a prayer for thee!
    The war of elements no fears impart
    To Love, whose deadliest bane is human Art:
    There lie the only rocks our course can check;
    Here moments menace--there are years of wreck!
    But hence ye thoughts that rise in Horror's shape!
    This hour bestows, or ever bars escape.
    Few words remain of mine my tale to close;
    Of thine but one to waft us from our foes;
    Yea--foes--to me will Giaffir's hate decline?
    And is not Osman, who would part us, thine?

                    XXI.

    "His head and faith from doubt and death
      Returned in time my guard to save;
      Few heard, none told, that o'er the wave
    From isle to isle I roved the while:
    And since, though parted from my band
    Too seldom now I leave the land,
    No deed they've done, nor deed shall do,
    Ere I have heard and doomed it too:
    I form the plan--decree the spoil--
    Tis fit I oftener share the toil.
    But now too long I've held thine ear;
    Time presses--floats my bark--and here
    We leave behind but hate and fear.
    To-morrow Osman with his train
    Arrives--to-night must break thy chain:
    And would'st thou save that haughty Bey,--
      Perchance his life who gave thee thine,--
    With me this hour away--away!
      But yet, though thou art plighted mine,
    Would'st thou recall thy willing vow,
    Appalled by truths imparted now,
    Here rest I--not to see thee wed:
    But be that peril on my head!"

                    XXII.

    Zuleika, mute and motionless,
    Stood like that Statue of Distress,
    When, her last hope for ever gone,
    The Mother hardened into stone;
    All in the maid that eye could see
    Was but a younger Niobe.
    But ere her lip, or even her eye,
    Essayed to speak, or look reply,
    Beneath the garden's wicket porch
    Far flashed on high a blazing torch!
    Another--and another--and another--
    "Oh! fly--no more--yet now my more than brother!"
    Far, wide, through every thicket spread
    The fearful lights are gleaming red;
    Nor these alone--for each right hand
    Is ready with a sheathless brand.
    They part--pursue--return, and wheel
    With searching flambeau, shining steel;
    And last of all, his sabre waving,
    Stern Giaffir in his fury raving:
    And now almost they touch the cave--
    Oh! must that grot be Selim's grave?

                    XXIII.

    Dauntless he stood--"'Tis come--soon past--
    One kiss, Zuleika--'tis my last:
      But yet my band not far from shore
    May hear this signal, see the flash;
    Yet now too few--the attempt were rash:
      No matter--yet one effort more."
    Forth to the cavern mouth he stept;
      His pistol's echo rang on high,
    Zuleika started not, nor wept,
      Despair benumbed her breast and eye!--
    "They hear me not, or if they ply
    Their oars,'tis but to see me die;
    That sound hath drawn my foes more nigh.
    Then forth my father's scimitar,
    Thou ne'er hast seen less equal war!
    Farewell, Zuleika!--Sweet! retire:
      Yet stay within--here linger safe,
      At thee his rage will only chafe.
    Stir not--lest even to thee perchance
    Some erring blade or ball should glance.
    Fear'st them for him?--may I expire
    If in this strife I seek thy sire!
    No--though by him that poison poured;
    No--though again he call me coward!
    But tamely shall I meet their steel?
    No--as each crest save his may feel!"

                    XXIV.

    One bound he made, and gained the sand:
      Already at his feet hath sunk
    The foremost of the prying band,
      A gasping head, a quivering trunk:
    Another falls--but round him close
    A swarming circle of his foes;
    From right to left his path he cleft,
      And almost met the meeting wave:
    His boat appears--not five oars' length--
    His comrades strain with desperate strength--
      Oh! are they yet in time to save?
      His feet the foremost breakers lave;
    His band are plunging in the bay,
    Their sabres glitter through the spray;
    Wet--wild--unwearied to the strand
    They struggle--now they touch the land!
    They come--'tis but to add to slaughter--
    His heart's best blood is on the water.

                    XXV.

    Escaped from shot, unharmed by steel,
    Or scarcely grazed its force to feel,
    Had Selim won, betrayed, beset,
    To where the strand and billows met;
    There as his last step left the land,
    And the last death-blow dealt his hand--
    Ah! wherefore did he turn to look
      For her his eye but sought in vain?
    That pause, that fatal gaze he took,
      Hath doomed his death, or fixed his chain.
    Sad proof, in peril and in pain,
    How late will Lover's hope remain!
    His back was to the dashing spray;
    Behind, but close, his comrades lay,
    When, at the instant, hissed the ball--
    "So may the foes of Giaffir fall!"
    Whose voice is heard? whose carbine rang?
    Whose bullet through the night-air sang,
    Too nearly, deadly aimed to err?
    'Tis thine--Abdallah's Murderer!
    The father slowly rued thy hate,
    The son hath found a quicker fate:
    Fast from his breast the blood is bubbling,
    The whiteness of the sea-foam troubling--
    If aught his lips essayed to groan,
    The rushing billows choked the tone!

                    XXVI.

    Morn slowly rolls the clouds away;
      Few trophies of the fight are there:
    The shouts that shook the midnight-bay
    Are silent; but some signs of fray
      That strand of strife may bear,
    And fragments of each shivered brand;
    Steps stamped; and dashed into the sand
    The print of many a struggling hand
      May there be marked; nor far remote
      A broken torch, an oarless boat;
    And tangled on the weeds that heap
    The beach where shelving to the deep
      There lies a white capote!
    'Tis rent in twain--one dark-red stain
    The wave yet ripples o'er in vain:
      But where is he who wore?
    Ye! who would o'er his relics weep,
    Go, seek them where the surges sweep
    Their burthen round Sigaeum's steep
      And cast on Lemnos' shore:
    The sea-birds shriek above the prey,
    O'er which their hungry beaks delay,
    As shaken on his restless pillow,
    His head heaves with the heaving billow;
    That hand, whose motion is not life,
    Yet feebly seems to menace strife,
    Flung by the tossing tide on high,
      Then levelled with the wave--
    What recks it, though that corse shall lie
      Within a living grave?
    The bird that tears that prostrate form
    Hath only robbed the meaner worm;
    The only heart, the only eye
    Had bled or wept to see him die,
    Had seen those scattered limbs composed,
      And mourned above his turban-stone,
    That heart hath burst--that eye was closed--
      Yea--closed before his own!

                    XXVII.

    By Helle's stream there is a voice of wail!
    And Woman's eye is wet--Man's cheek is pale:
    Zuleika! last of Giaffir's race,
      Thy destined lord is come too late:
    He sees not--ne'er shall see thy face!
          Can he not hear
    The loud Wul-wulleh warn his distant ear?
      Thy handmaids weeping at the gate,
      The Koran-chanters of the Hymn of Fate,
      The silent slaves with folded arms that wait,
    Sighs in the hall, and shrieks upon the gale,
          Tell him thy tale!
    Thou didst not view thy Selim fall!
      That fearful moment when he left the cave
          Thy heart grew chill:
      He was thy hope--thy joy--thy love--thine all,
      And that last thought on him thou could'st not save
            Sufficed to kill;
    Burst forth in one wild cry--and all was still.
      Peace to thy broken heart--and virgin grave!
    Ah! happy! but of life to lose the worst!
    That grief--though deep--though fatal--was thy first!
    Thrice happy! ne'er to feel nor fear the force
    Of absence--shame--pride--hate--revenge--remorse!
    And, oh! that pang where more than Madness lies
    The Worm that will not sleep--and never dies;
    Thought of the gloomy day and ghastly night,
    That dreads the darkness, and yet loathes the light,
    That winds around, and tears the quivering heart!
    Ah! wherefore not consume it--and depart!
    Woe to thee, rash and unrelenting Chief!
      Vainly thou heap'st the dust upon thy head,
      Vainly the sackcloth o'er thy limbs dost spread:
      By that same hand Abdallah--Selim bled.
    Now let it tear thy beard in idle grief:
    Thy pride of heart, thy bride for Osman's bed,
    She, whom thy Sultan had but seen to wed,
          Thy Daughter's dead!
      Hope of thine age, thy twilight's lonely beam,
      The Star hath set that shone on Helle's stream.
    What quenched its ray?--the blood that thou hast shed!
    Hark! to the hurried question of Despair:
    "Where is my child?"--an Echo answers--"Where?"

                    XXVIII.

    Within the place of thousand tombs
      That shine beneath, while dark above
    The sad but living cypress glooms
      And withers not, though branch and leaf
    Are stamped with an eternal grief,
      Like early unrequited Love,
    One spot exists, which ever blooms,
      Ev'n in that deadly grove--
    A single rose is shedding there
      Its lonely lustre, meek and pale:
    It looks as planted by Despair--
      So white--so faint--the slightest gale
    Might whirl the leaves on high;
      And yet, though storms and blight assail,
    And hands more rude than wintry sky
      May wring it from the stem--in vain--
      To-morrow sees it bloom again!
    The stalk some Spirit gently rears,
    And waters with celestial tears;
      For well may maids of Helle deem
    That this can be no earthly flower,
    Which mocks the tempest's withering hour,
    And buds unsheltered by a bower;
    Nor droops, though Spring refuse her shower,
      Nor woos the Summer beam:
    To it the livelong night there sings
      A Bird unseen--but not remote:
    Invisible his airy wings,
    But soft as harp that Houri strings
      His long entrancing note!
    It were the Bulbul; but his throat,
      Though mournful, pours not such a strain:
    For they who listen cannot leave
    The spot, but linger there and grieve,
      As if they loved in vain!
    And yet so sweet the tears they shed,
    'Tis sorrow so unmixed with dread,
    They scarce can bear the morn to break
      That melancholy spell,
    And longer yet would weep and wake,
      He sings so wild and well!
    But when the day-blush bursts from high
      Expires that magic melody.
    And some have been who could believe,
    (So fondly youthful dreams deceive,
      Yet harsh be they that blame,)
    That note so piercing and profound
    Will shape and syllable its sound
      Into Zuleika's name.
    'Tis from her cypress summit heard,
    That melts in air the liquid word:
    'Tis from her lowly virgin earth
    That white rose takes its tender birth.
    There late was laid a marble stone;
    Eve saw it placed--the Morrow gone!
    It was no mortal arm that bore
    That deep fixed pillar to the shore;
    For there, as Helle's legends tell,
    Next morn 'twas found where Selim fell;
    Lashed by the tumbling tide, whose wave
    Denied his bones a holier grave:
    And there by night, reclined, 'tis said.
    Is seen a ghastly turbaned head:
      And hence extended by the billow,
      'Tis named the "Pirate-phantom's pillow!"
      Where first it lay that mourning flower
      Hath flourished; flourisheth this hour,
    Alone and dewy--coldly pure and pale;
    As weeping Beauty's cheek at Sorrow's tale!
                    
                             THE CORSAIR:

                                A TALE.

        ----"I suoi pensieri in lui dormir non ponno."

Tasso, Gerusalemme Liberata, Canto X. .

                      CANTO THE FIRST.

    "----nessun maggior dolore,
    Che ricordarsi del tempo felice
    Nella miseria,----"
                                                 Dante, Inferno, v. 121.

                    I.

    "O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea,
    Our thoughts as boundless, and our souls as free,
    Far as the breeze can bear, the billows foam,
    Survey our empire, and behold our home!
    These are our realms, no limits to their sway--
    Our flag the sceptre all who meet obey.
    Ours the wild life in tumult still to range
    From toil to rest, and joy in every change.
    Oh, who can tell? not thou, luxurious slave!
    Whose soul would sicken o'er the heaving wave;
    Not thou, vain lord of Wantonness and Ease!
    Whom Slumber soothes not--Pleasure cannot please--
    Oh, who can tell, save he whose heart hath tried,
    And danced in triumph o'er the waters wide,
    The exulting sense--the pulse's maddening play,
    That thrills the wanderer of that trackless way?
    That for itself can woo the approaching fight,
    And turn what some deem danger to delight;
    That seeks what cravens shun with more than zeal,
    And where the feebler faint can only feel--
    Feel--to the rising bosom's inmost core,
    Its hope awaken and its spirit soar?
    No dread of Death--if with us die our foes--
    Save that it seems even duller than repose;
    Come when it will--we snatch the life of Life--
    When lost--what recks it by disease or strife?
    Let him who crawls, enamoured of decay,
    Cling to his couch, and sicken years away;
    Heave his thick breath, and shake his palsied head;
    Ours the fresh turf, and not the feverish bed,--
    While gasp by gasp he falters forth his soul,
    Ours with one pang--one bound--escapes control.
    His corse may boast its urn and narrow cave,
    And they who loathed his life may gild his grave:
    Ours are the tears, though few, sincerely shed,
    When Ocean shrouds and sepulchres our dead.
    For us, even banquets fond regret supply
    In the red cup that crowns our memory;
    And the brief epitaph in Danger's day,
    When those who win at length divide the prey,
    And cry, Remembrance saddening o'er each brow,
    How had the brave who fell exulted now!"

                    II.

    Such were the notes that from the Pirate's isle
    Around the kindling watch-fire rang the while:
    Such were the sounds that thrilled the rocks along,
    And unto ears as rugged seemed a song!
    In scattered groups upon the golden sand,
    They game--carouse--converse--or whet the brand;
    Select the arms--to each his blade assign,
    And careless eye the blood that dims its shine;
    Repair the boat, replace the helm or oar,
    While others straggling muse along the shore;
    For the wild bird the busy springes set,
    Or spread beneath the sun the dripping net:
    Gaze where some distant sail a speck supplies,
    With all the thirsting eye of Enterprise;
    Tell o'er the tales of many a night of toil,
    And marvel where they next shall seize a spoil:
    No matter where--their chief's allotment this;
    Theirs to believe no prey nor plan amiss.
    But who that Chief? his name on every shore
    Is famed and feared--they ask and know no more
    With these he mingles not but to command;
    Few are his words, but keen his eye and hand.
    Ne'er seasons he with mirth their jovial mess,
    But they forgive his silence for success.
    Ne'er for his lip the purpling cup they fill,
    That goblet passes him untasted still--
    And for his fare--the rudest of his crew
    Would that, in turn, have passed untasted too;
    Earth's coarsest bread, the garden's homeliest roots,
    And scarce the summer luxury of fruits,
    His short repast in humbleness supply
    With all a hermit's board would scarce deny.
    But while he shuns the grosser joys of sense,
    His mind seems nourished by that abstinence.
    "Steer to that shore!"--they sail. "Do this!"--'tis done:
    "Now form and follow me!"--the spoil is won.
    Thus prompt his accents and his actions still,
    And all obey and few inquire his will;
    To such, brief answer and contemptuous eye
    Convey reproof, nor further deign reply.

                    III.

    "A sail!--a sail!"--a promised prize to Hope!
    Her nation--flag--how speaks the telescope?
    No prize, alas! but yet a welcome sail:
    The blood-red signal glitters in the gale.
    Yes--she is ours--a home-returning bark--
    Blow fair, thou breeze!--she anchors ere the dark.
    Already doubled is the cape--our bay
    Receives that prow which proudly spurns the spray.
    How gloriously her gallant course she goes!
    Her white wings flying--never from her foes--
    She walks the waters like a thing of Life!
    And seems to dare the elements to strife.
    Who would not brave the battle-fire, the wreck,
    To move the monarch of her peopled deck!

                    IV.

    Hoarse o'er her side the rustling cable rings:
    The sails are furled; and anchoring round she swings;
    And gathering loiterers on the land discern
    Her boat descending from the latticed stern.
    'Tis manned--the oars keep concert to the strand,
    Till grates her keel upon the shallow sand.
    Hail to the welcome shout!--the friendly speech!
    When hand grasps hand uniting on the beach;
    The smile, the question, and the quick reply,
    And the Heart's promise of festivity!

                    V.

    The tidings spread, and gathering grows the crowd:
    The hum of voices, and the laughter loud,
    And Woman's gentler anxious tone is heard--
    Friends'--husbands'--lovers' names in each dear word:
    "Oh! are they safe? we ask not of success--
    But shall we see them? will their accents bless?
    From where the battle roars, the billows chafe,
    They doubtless boldly did--but who are safe?
    Here let them haste to gladden and surprise,
    And kiss the doubt from these delighted eyes!"

                    VI.

    "Where is our Chief? for him we bear report--
    And doubt that joy--which hails our coming--short;
    Yet thus sincere--'tis cheering, though so brief;
    But, Juan! instant guide us to our Chief:
    Our greeting paid, we'll feast on our return,
    And all shall hear what each may wish to learn."
    Ascending slowly by the rock-hewn way,
    To where his watch-tower beetles o'er the bay,
    By bushy brake, the wild flowers blossoming,
    And freshness breathing from each silver spring,
    Whose scattered streams from granite basins burst,
    Leap into life, and sparkling woo your thirst;
    From crag to cliff they mount--Near yonder cave,
    What lonely straggler looks along the wave?
    In pensive posture leaning on the brand,
    Not oft a resting-staff to that red hand?
    "'Tis he--'tis Conrad--here--as wont--alone;
    On--Juan!--on--and make our purpose known.
    The bark he views--and tell him we would greet
    His ear with tidings he must quickly meet:
    We dare not yet approach--thou know'st his mood,
    When strange or uninvited steps intrude."

                    VII.

    Him Juan sought, and told of their intent;--
    He spake not, but a sign expressed assent,
    These Juan calls--they come--to their salute
    He bends him slightly, but his lips are mute.
    "These letters, Chief, are from the Greek--the spy,
    Who still proclaims our spoil or peril nigh:
    Whate'er his tidings, we can well report,
    Much that"--"Peace, peace!"--he cuts their prating short.
    Wondering they turn, abashed, while each to each
    Conjecture whispers in his muttering speech:
    They watch his glance with many a stealing look,
    To gather how that eye the tidings took;
    But, this as if he guessed, with head aside,
    Perchance from some emotion, doubt, or pride,
    He read the scroll--"My tablets, Juan, hark--
    Where is Gonsalvo?"

                         "In the anchored bark."
    "There let him stay--to him this order bear--
    Back to your duty--for my course prepare:
    Myself this enterprise to-night will share."
    "To-night, Lord Conrad?"
                             "Aye! at set of sun:
    The breeze will freshen when the day is done.
    My corslet--cloak--one hour and we are gone.
    Sling on thy bugle--see that free from rust
    My carbine-lock springs worthy of my trust;
    Be the edge sharpened of my boarding-brand,
    And give its guard more room to fit my hand.
    This let the Armourer with speed dispose;
    Last time, it more fatigued my arm than foes;
    Mark that the signal-gun be duly fired,
    To tell us when the hour of stay's expired."

                    VIII.

    They make obeisance, and retire in haste,
    Too soon to seek again the watery waste:
    Yet they repine not--so that Conrad guides;
    And who dare question aught that he decides?
    That man of loneliness and mystery,
    Scarce seen to smile, and seldom heard to sigh;
    Whose name appals the fiercest of his crew,
    And tints each swarthy cheek with sallower hue;
    Still sways their souls with that commanding art
    That dazzles, leads, yet chills the vulgar heart.
    What is that spell, that thus his lawless train
    Confess and envy--yet oppose in vain?
    What should it be, that thus their faith can bind?
    The power of Thought--the magic of the Mind!
    Linked with success, assumed and kept with skill,
    That moulds another's weakness to its will;
    Wields with their hands, but, still to these unknown,
    Makes even their mightiest deeds appear his own.
    Such hath it been--shall be--beneath the Sun
    The many still must labour for the one!
    'Tis Nature's doom--but let the wretch who toils,
    Accuse not--hate not--him who wears the spoils.
    Oh! if he knew the weight of splendid chains,
    How light the balance of his humbler pains!

                    IX.

    Unlike the heroes of each ancient race,
    Demons in act, but Gods at least in face,
    In Conrad's form seems little to admire,
    Though his dark eyebrow shades a glance of fire:
    Robust but not Herculean--to the sight
    No giant frame sets forth his common height;
    Yet, in the whole, who paused to look again,
    Saw more than marks the crowd of vulgar men;
    They gaze and marvel how--and still confess
    That thus it is, but why they cannot guess.
    Sun-burnt his cheek, his forehead high and pale
    The sable curls in wild profusion veil;
    And oft perforce his rising lip reveals
    The haughtier thought it curbs, but scarce conceals.
    Though smooth his voice, and calm his general mien,
    Still seems there something he would not have seen:
    His features' deepening lines and varying hue
    At times attracted, yet perplexed the view,
    As if within that murkiness of mind
    Worked feelings fearful, and yet undefined;
    Such might it be--that none could truly tell--
    Too close inquiry his stern glance would quell.
    There breathe but few whose aspect might defy
    The full encounter of his searching eye;
    He had the skill, when Cunning's gaze would seek
    To probe his heart and watch his changing cheek,
    At once the observer's purpose to espy,
    And on himself roll back his scrutiny,
    Lest he to Conrad rather should betray
    Some secret thought, than drag that Chief's to day.
    There was a laughing Devil in his sneer,
    That raised emotions both of rage and fear;
    And where his frown of hatred darkly fell,
    Hope withering fled--and Mercy sighed farewell!

                    X.

    Slight are the outward signs of evil thought,
    Within--within--'twas there the spirit wrought!
    Love shows all changes--Hate, Ambition, Guile,
    Betray no further than the bitter smile;
    The lip's least curl, the lightest paleness thrown
    Along the governed aspect, speak alone
    Of deeper passions; and to judge their mien,
    He, who would see, must be himself unseen.
    Then--with the hurried tread, the upward eye,
    The clenched hand, the pause of agony,
    That listens, starting, lest the step too near
    Approach intrusive on that mood of fear:
    Then--with each feature working from the heart,
    With feelings, loosed to strengthen--not depart,
    That rise--convulse--contend--that freeze or glow,
    Flush in the cheek, or damp upon the brow;
    Then--Stranger! if thou canst, and tremblest not,
    Behold his soul--the rest that soothes his lot!
    Mark how that lone and blighted bosom sears
    The scathing thought of execrated years!
    Behold--but who hath seen, or e'er shall see,
    Man as himself--the secret spirit free?

                    XI.

    Yet was not Conrad thus by Nature sent
    To lead the guilty--Guilt's worse instrument--
    His soul was changed, before his deeds had driven
    Him forth to war with Man and forfeit Heaven.
    Warped by the world in Disappointment's school,
    In words too wise--in conduct there a fool;
    Too firm to yield, and far too proud to stoop,
    Doomed by his very virtues for a dupe,
    He cursed those virtues as the cause of ill,
    And not the traitors who betrayed him still;
    Nor deemed that gifts bestowed on better men
    Had left him joy, and means to give again.
    Feared--shunned--belied--ere Youth had lost her force,
    He hated Man too much to feel remorse,
    And thought the voice of Wrath a sacred call,
    To pay the injuries of some on all.
    He knew himself a villain--but he deemed
    The rest no better than the thing he seemed;
    And scorned the best as hypocrites who hid
    Those deeds the bolder spirit plainly did.
    He knew himself detested, but he knew
    The hearts that loathed him, crouched and dreaded too.
    Lone, wild, and strange, he stood alike exempt
    From all affection and from all contempt:
    His name could sadden, and his acts surprise;
    But they that feared him dared not to despise:
    Man spurns the worm, but pauses ere he wake
    The slumbering venom of the folded snake:
    The first may turn, but not avenge the blow;
    The last expires, but leaves no living foe;
    Fast to the doomed offender's form it clings,
    And he may crush--not conquer--still it stings!

                    XII.

    None are all evil--quickening round his heart,
    One softer feeling would not yet depart;
    Oft could he sneer at others as beguiled
    By passions worthy of a fool or child;
    Yet 'gainst that passion vainly still he strove,
    And even in him it asks the name of Love!
    Yes, it was love--unchangeable--unchanged,
    Felt but for one from whom he never ranged;
    Though fairest captives daily met his eye,
    He shunned, nor sought, but coldly passed them by;
    Though many a beauty drooped in prisoned bower,
    None ever soothed his most unguarded hour,
    Yes--it was Love--if thoughts of tenderness,
    Tried in temptation, strengthened by distress,
    Unmoved by absence, firm in every clime,
    And yet--Oh more than all!--untired by Time;
    Which nor defeated hope, nor baffled wile,
    Could render sullen were She near to smile,
    Nor rage could fire, nor sickness fret to vent
    On her one murmur of his discontent;
    Which still would meet with joy, with calmness part,
    Lest that his look of grief should reach her heart;
    Which nought removed, nor menaced to remove--
    If there be Love in mortals--this was Love!
    He was a villain--aye, reproaches shower
    On him--but not the Passion, nor its power,
    Which only proved--all other virtues gone--
    Not Guilt itself could quench this loveliest one!

                    XIII.

    He paused a moment--till his hastening men
    Passed the first winding downward to the glen.
    "Strange tidings!--many a peril have I passed,
    Nor know I why this next appears the last!
    Yet so my heart forebodes, but must not fear,
    Nor shall my followers find me falter here.
    'Tis rash to meet--but surer death to wait
    Till here they hunt us to undoubted fate;
    And, if my plan but hold, and Fortune smile,
    We'll furnish mourners for our funeral pile.
    Aye, let them slumber--peaceful be their dreams!
    Morn ne'er awoke them with such brilliant beams
    As kindle high to-night (but blow, thou breeze!)
    To warm these slow avengers of the seas.
    Now to Medora--Oh! my sinking heart,
    Long may her own be lighter than thou art!
    Yet was I brave--mean boast where all are brave!
    Ev'n insects sting for aught they seek to save.
    This common courage which with brutes we share,
    That owes its deadliest efforts to Despair,
    Small merit claims--but 'twas my nobler hope
    To teach my few with numbers still to cope;
    Long have I led them--not to vainly bleed:
    No medium now--we perish or succeed!
    So let it be--it irks not me to die;
    But thus to urge them whence they cannot fly.
    My lot hath long had little of my care,
    But chafes my pride thus baffled in the snare:
    Is this my skill? my craft? to set at last
    Hope, Power and Life upon a single cast?
    Oh, Fate!--accuse thy folly--not thy fate;
    She may redeem thee still--nor yet too late."

                    XIV.

    Thus with himself communion held he, till
    He reached the summit of his tower-crowned hill:
    There at the portal paused--for wild and soft
    He heard those accents never heard too oft!
    Through the high lattice far yet sweet they rung,
    And these the notes his Bird of Beauty sung:

                    1.

    "Deep in my soul that tender secret dwells,
      Lonely and lost to light for evermore,
    Save when to thine my heart responsive swells,
      Then trembles into silence as before.

                    2.

    "There, in its centre, a sepulchral lamp
      Burns the slow flame, eternal--but unseen;
    Which not the darkness of Despair can damp,
      Though vain its ray as it had never been.

                    3.

    "Remember me--Oh! pass not thou my grave
      Without one thought whose relics there recline:
    The only pang my bosom dare not brave
      Must be to find forgetfulness in thine.

                    4.

    "My fondest--faintest--latest accents hear--
      Grief for the dead not Virtue can reprove;
    Then give me all I ever asked--a tear,
      The first--last--sole reward of so much love!"

    He passed the portal, crossed the corridor,
    And reached the chamber as the strain gave o'er:
    "My own Medora! sure thy song is sad--"

    "In Conrad's absence would'st thou have it glad?
    Without thine ear to listen to my lay,
    Still must my song my thoughts, my soul betray:
    Still must each accent to my bosom suit,
    My heart unhushed--although my lips were mute!
    Oh! many a night on this lone couch reclined,
    My dreaming fear with storms hath winged the wind,
    And deemed the breath that faintly fanned thy sail
    The murmuring prelude of the ruder gale;
    Though soft--it seemed the low prophetic dirge,
    That mourned thee floating on the savage surge:
    Still would I rise to rouse the beacon fire,
    Lest spies less true should let the blaze expire;
    And many a restless hour outwatched each star,
    And morning came--and still thou wert afar.
    Oh! how the chill blast on my bosom blew,
    And day broke dreary on my troubled view,
    And still I gazed and gazed--and not a prow
    Was granted to my tears--my truth--my vow!
    At length--'twas noon--I hailed and blest the mast
    That met my sight--it neared--Alas! it passed!
    Another came--Oh God! 'twas thine at last!
    Would that those days were over! wilt thou ne'er,
    My Conrad! learn the joys of peace to share?
    Sure thou hast more than wealth, and many a home
    As bright as this invites us not to roam:
    Thou know'st it is not peril that I fear,
    I only tremble when thou art not here;
    Then not for mine, but that far dearer life,
    Which flies from love and languishes for strife--
    How strange that heart, to me so tender still,
    Should war with Nature and its better will!"

    "Yea, strange indeed--that heart hath long been changed;
    Worm-like 'twas trampled--adder-like avenged--
    Without one hope on earth beyond thy love,
    And scarce a glimpse of mercy from above.
    Yet the same feeling which thou dost condemn,
    My very love to thee is hate to them,
    So closely mingling here, that disentwined,
    I cease to love thee when I love Mankind:
    Yet dread not this--the proof of all the past
    Assures the future that my love will last;
    But--Oh, Medora! nerve thy gentler heart;
    This hour again--but not for long--we part."

    "This hour we part!--my heart foreboded this:
    Thus ever fade my fairy dreams of bliss.
    This hour--it cannot be--this hour away!
    Yon bark hath hardly anchored in the bay:
    Her consort still is absent, and her crew
    Have need of rest before they toil anew;
    My Love! thou mock'st my weakness; and wouldst steel
    My breast before the time when it must feel;
    But trifle now no more with my distress,
    Such mirth hath less of play than bitterness.
    Be silent, Conrad!--dearest! come and share
    The feast these hands delighted to prepare;
    Light toil! to cull and dress thy frugal fare!
    See, I have plucked the fruit that promised best,
    And where not sure, perplexed, but pleased, I guessed
    At such as seemed the fairest; thrice the hill
    My steps have wound to try the coolest rill;
    Yes! thy Sherbet to-night will sweetly flow,
    See how it sparkles in its vase of snow!
    The grapes' gay juice thy bosom never cheers;
    Thou more than Moslem when the cup appears:
    Think not I mean to chide--for I rejoice
    What others deem a penance is thy choice.
    But come, the board is spread; our silver lamp
    Is trimmed, and heeds not the Sirocco's damp:
    Then shall my handmaids while the time along,
    And join with me the dance, or wake the song;
    Or my guitar, which still thou lov'st to hear,
    Shall soothe or lull--or, should it vex thine ear,
    We'll turn the tale, by Ariosto told,
    Of fair Olympia loved and left of old.
    Why, thou wert worse than he who broke his vow
    To that lost damsel, should thou leave me now--
    Or even that traitor chief--I've seen thee smile,
    When the clear sky showed Ariadne's Isle,
    Which I have pointed from these cliffs the while:
    And thus half sportive--half in fear--I said,
    Lest Time should raise that doubt to more than dread,
    Thus Conrad, too, will quit me for the main:
    And he deceived me--for--he came again!"

    "Again, again--and oft again--my Love!
    If there be life below, and hope above,
    He will return--but now, the moments bring
    The time of parting with redoubled wing:
    The why, the where--what boots it now to tell?
    Since all must end in that wild word--Farewell!
    Yet would I fain--did time allow--disclose--
    Fear not--these are no formidable foes!
    And here shall watch a more than wonted guard,
    For sudden siege and long defence prepared:
    Nor be thou lonely, though thy Lord's away,
    Our matrons and thy handmaids with thee stay;
    And this thy comfort--that, when next we meet,
    Security shall make repose more sweet.
    List!--'tis the bugle!"--Juan shrilly blew--
    "One kiss--one more--another--Oh! Adieu!"
    She rose--she sprung--she clung to his embrace,
    Till his heart heaved beneath her hidden face:
    He dared not raise to his that deep-blue eye,
    Which downcast drooped in tearless agony.
    Her long fair hair lay floating o'er his arms,
    In all the wildness of dishevelled charms;
    Scarce beat that bosom where his image dwelt
    So full--that feeling seem'd almost unfelt!
    Hark--peals the thunder of the signal-gun!
    It told 'twas sunset, and he cursed that sun.
    Again--again--that form he madly pressed,
    Which mutely clasped, imploringly caressed!
    And tottering to the couch his bride he bore,
    One moment gazed--as if to gaze no more;
    Felt that for him Earth held but her alone,
    Kissed her cold forehead--turned--is Conrad gone?

                    XV.

    "And is he gone?"--on sudden solitude
    How oft that fearful question will intrude!
    "'Twas but an instant past, and here he stood!
    And now"--without the portal's porch she rushed,
    And then at length her tears in freedom gushed;
    Big, bright, and fast, unknown to her they fell;
    But still her lips refused to send--"Farewell!"
    For in that word--that fatal word--howe'er
    We promise--hope--believe--there breathes Despair.
    O'er every feature of that still, pale face,
    Had Sorrow fixed what Time can ne'er erase:
    The tender blue of that large loving eye
    Grew frozen with its gaze on vacancy,
    Till--Oh, how far!--it caught a glimpse of him,
    And then it flowed, and phrensied seemed to swim
    Through those long, dark, and glistening lashes dewed
    With drops of sadness oft to be renewed.
    "He's gone!"--against her heart that hand is driven,
    Convulsed and quick--then gently raised to Heaven:
    She looked and saw the heaving of the main:
    The white sail set--she dared not look again;
    But turned with sickening soul within the gate--
    "It is no dream--and I am desolate!"

                    XVI.

    From crag to crag descending, swiftly sped
    Stern Conrad down, nor once he turned his head;
    But shrunk whene'er the windings of his way
    Forced on his eye what he would not survey,
    His lone, but lovely dwelling on the steep,
    That hailed him first when homeward from the deep:
    And she--the dim and melancholy Star,
    Whose ray of Beauty reached him from afar,
    On her he must not gaze, he must not think--
    There he might rest--but on Destruction's brink:
    Yet once almost he stopped--and nearly gave
    His fate to chance, his projects to the wave:
    But no--it must not be--a worthy chief
    May melt, but not betray to Woman's grief.
    He sees his bark, he notes how fair the wind,
    And sternly gathers all his might of mind:
    Again he hurries on--and as he hears
    The clang of tumult vibrate on his ears,
    The busy sounds, the bustle of the shore,
    The shout, the signal, and the dashing oar;
    As marks his eye the seaboy on the mast,
    The anchors rise, the sails unfurling fast,
    The waving kerchiefs of the crowd that urge
    That mute Adieu to those who stem the surge;
    And more than all, his blood-red flag aloft,
    He marvelled how his heart could seem so soft.
    Fire in his glance, and wildness in his breast,
    He feels of all his former self possest;
    He bounds--he flies--until his footsteps reach
    The verge where ends the cliff, begins the beach,
    There checks his speed; but pauses less to breathe
    The breezy freshness of the deep beneath,
    Than there his wonted statelier step renew;
    Nor rush, disturbed by haste, to vulgar view:
    For well had Conrad learned to curb the crowd,
    By arts that veil, and oft preserve the proud;
    His was the lofty port, the distant mien,
    That seems to shun the sight--and awes if seen:
    The solemn aspect, and the high-born eye,
    That checks low mirth, but lacks not courtesy;
    All these he wielded to command assent:
    But where he wished to win, so well unbent,
    That Kindness cancelled fear in those who heard,
    And others' gifts showed mean beside his word,
    When echoed to the heart as from his own
    His deep yet tender melody of tone:
    But such was foreign to his wonted mood,
    He cared not what he softened, but subdued;
    The evil passions of his youth had made
    Him value less who loved--than what obeyed.

                    XVII.

    Around him mustering ranged his ready guard.
    Before him Juan stands--"Are all prepared?"
    "They are--nay more--embarked: the latest boat
    Waits but my chief----"
                           "My sword, and my capote."
    Soon firmly girded on, and lightly slung,
    His belt and cloak were o'er his shoulders flung:
    "Call Pedro here!" He comes--and Conrad bends,
    With all the courtesy he deigned his friends;
    "Receive these tablets, and peruse with care,
    Words of high trust and truth are graven there;
    Double the guard, and when Anselmo's bark
    Arrives, let him alike these orders mark:
    In three days (serve the breeze) the sun shall shine
    On our return--till then all peace be thine!"
    This said, his brother Pirate's hand he wrung,
    Then to his boat with haughty gesture sprung.
    Flashed the dipt oars, and sparkling with the stroke,
    Around the waves' phosphoric brightness broke;
    They gain the vessel--on the deck he stands,--
    Shrieks the shrill whistle, ply the busy hands--
    He marks how well the ship her helm obeys,
    How gallant all her crew, and deigns to praise.
    His eyes of pride to young Gonsalvo turn--
    Why doth he start, and inly seem to mourn?
    Alas! those eyes beheld his rocky tower,
    And live a moment o'er the parting hour;
    She--his Medora--did she mark the prow?
    Ah! never loved he half so much as now!
    But much must yet be done ere dawn of day--
    Again he mans himself and turns away;
    Down to the cabin with Gonsalvo bends,
    And there unfolds his plan--his means, and ends;
    Before them burns the lamp, and spreads the chart,
    And all that speaks and aids the naval art;
    They to the midnight watch protract debate;
    To anxious eyes what hour is ever late?
    Meantime, the steady breeze serenely blew,
    And fast and falcon-like the vessel flew;
    Passed the high headlands of each clustering isle,
    To gain their port--long--long ere morning smile:
    And soon the night-glass through the narrow bay
    Discovers where the Pacha's galleys lay.
    Count they each sail, and mark how there supine
    The lights in vain o'er heedless Moslem shine.
    Secure, unnoted, Conrad's prow passed by,
    And anchored where his ambush meant to lie;
    Screened from espial by the jutting cape,
    That rears on high its rude fantastic shape.
    Then rose his band to duty--not from sleep--
    Equipped for deeds alike on land or deep;
    While leaned their Leader o'er the fretting flood,
    And calmly talked--and yet he talked of blood!

                     CANTO THE SECOND.

              "Conosceste i dubbiosi desiri?"
                        Dante, Inferno, v, 120.

                    I.

    In Coron's bay floats many a galley light,
    Through Coron's lattices the lamps are bright,
    For Seyd, the Pacha, makes a feast to-night:
    A feast for promised triumph yet to come,
    When he shall drag the fettered Rovers home;
    This hath he sworn by Allah and his sword,
    And faithful to his firman and his word,
    His summoned prows collect along the coast,
    And great the gathering crews, and loud the boast;
    Already shared the captives and the prize,
    Though far the distant foe they thus despise;
    'Tis but to sail--no doubt to-morrow's Sun
    Will see the Pirates bound--their haven won!
    Meantime the watch may slumber, if they will,
    Nor only wake to war, but dreaming kill.
    Though all, who can, disperse on shore and seek
    To flesh their glowing valour on the Greek;
    How well such deed becomes the turbaned brave--
    To bare the sabre's edge before a slave!
    Infest his dwelling--but forbear to slay,
    Their arms are strong, yet merciful to-day,
    And do not deign to smite because they may!
    Unless some gay caprice suggests the blow,
    To keep in practice for the coming foe.
    Revel and rout the evening hours beguile,
    And they who wish to wear a head must smile;
    For Moslem mouths produce their choicest cheer,
    And hoard their curses, till the coast is clear.

                    II.

    High in his hall reclines the turbaned Seyd;
    Around--the bearded chiefs he came to lead.
    Removed the banquet, and the last pilaff--
    Forbidden draughts, 'tis said, he dared to quaff,
    Though to the rest the sober berry's juice
    The slaves bear round for rigid Moslems' use;
    The long chibouque's dissolving cloud supply,
    While dance the Almas to wild minstrelsy.
    The rising morn will view the chiefs embark;
    But waves are somewhat treacherous in the dark:
    And revellers may more securely sleep
    On silken couch than o'er the rugged deep:
    Feast there who can--nor combat till they must,
    And less to conquest than to Korans trust;
    And yet the numbers crowded in his host
    Might warrant more than even the Pacha's boast.

                    III.

    With cautious reverence from the outer gate
    Slow stalks the slave, whose office there to wait,
    Bows his bent head--his hand salutes the floor,
    Ere yet his tongue the trusted tidings bore:
    "A captive Dervise, from the Pirate's nest
    Escaped, is here--himself would tell the rest."
    He took the sign from Seyd's assenting eye,
    And led the holy man in silence nigh.
    His arms were folded on his dark-green vest,
    His step was feeble, and his look deprest;
    Yet worn he seemed of hardship more than years,
    And pale his cheek with penance, not from fears.
    Vowed to his God--his sable locks he wore,
    And these his lofty cap rose proudly o'er:
    Around his form his loose long robe was thrown,
    And wrapt a breast bestowed on heaven alone;
    Submissive, yet with self-possession manned,
    He calmly met the curious eyes that scanned;
    And question of his coming fain would seek,
    Before the Pacha's will allowed to speak.

                    IV.

    "Whence com'st thou, Dervise?"
                                   "From the Outlaw's den
    A fugitive--"
                   "Thy capture where and when?"
    "From Scalanova's port to Scio's isle,
    The Saick was bound; but Allah did not smile
    Upon our course--the Moslem merchant's gains
    The Rovers won; our limbs have worn their chains.
    I had no death to fear, nor wealth to boast,
    Beyond the wandering freedom which I lost;
    At length a fisher's humble boat by night
    Afforded hope, and offered chance of flight;
    I seized the hour, and find my safety here--
    With thee--most mighty Pacha! who can fear?"

    "How speed the outlaws? stand they well prepared,
    Their plundered wealth, and robber's rock, to guard?
    Dream they of this our preparation, doomed
    To view with fire their scorpion nest consumed?"

    "Pacha! the fettered captive's mourning eye,
    That weeps for flight, but ill can play the spy;
    I only heard the reckless waters roar,
    Those waves that would not bear me from the shore;
    I only marked the glorious Sun and sky,
    Too bright--too blue--for my captivity;
    And felt that all which Freedom's bosom cheers
    Must break my chain before it dried my tears.
    This mayst thou judge, at least, from my escape,
    They little deem of aught in Peril's shape;
    Else vainly had I prayed or sought the Chance
    That leads me here--if eyed with vigilance:
    The careless guard that did not see me fly,
    May watch as idly when thy power is nigh.
    Pacha! my limbs are faint--and nature craves
    Food for my hunger, rest from tossing waves:
    Permit my absence--peace be with thee! Peace
    With all around!--now grant repose--release."

    "Stay, Dervise! I have more to question--stay,
    I do command thee--sit--dost hear?--obey!
    More I must ask, and food the slaves shall bring;
    Thou shall not pine where all are banqueting:
    The supper done--prepare thee to reply,
    Clearly and full--I love not mystery."
    'Twere vain to guess what shook the pious man,
    Who looked not lovingly on that Divan;
    Nor showed high relish for the banquet prest,
    And less respect for every fellow guest.
    Twas but a moment's peevish hectic passed
    Along his cheek, and tranquillised as fast:
    He sate him down in silence, and his look
    Resumed the calmness which before forsook:
    The feast was ushered in--but sumptuous fare
    He shunned as if some poison mingled there.
    For one so long condemned to toil and fast,
    Methinks he strangely spares the rich repast.
    "What ails thee, Dervise? eat--dost thou suppose
    This feast a Christian's? or my friends thy foes?
    Why dost thou shun the salt? that sacred pledge,
    Which, once partaken, blunts the sabre's edge,
    Makes even contending tribes in peace unite,
    And hated hosts seem brethren to the sight!"

    "Salt seasons dainties--and my food is still
    The humblest root, my drink the simplest rill;
    And my stern vow and Order's laws oppose
    To break or mingle bread with friends or foes;
    It may seem strange--if there be aught to dread
    That peril rests upon my single head;
    But for thy sway--nay more--thy Sultan's throne,
    I taste nor bread nor banquet--save alone;
    Infringed our Order's rule, the Prophet's rage
    To Mecca's dome might bar my pilgrimage."

    "Well--as thou wilt--ascetic as thou art--
    One question answer; then in peace depart.
    How many?--Ha! it cannot sure be day?
    What Star--what Sun is bursting on the bay?
    It shines a lake of fire!--away--away!
    Ho! treachery! my guards! my scimitar!
    The galleys feed the flames--and I afar!
    Accursed Dervise!--these thy tidings--thou
    Some villain spy--seize--cleave him--slay him now!"

    Up rose the Dervise with that burst of light,
    Nor less his change of form appalled the sight:
    Up rose that Dervise--not in saintly garb,
    But like a warrior bounding on his barb,
    Dashed his high cap, and tore his robe away--
    Shone his mailed breast, and flashed his sabre's ray!
    His close but glittering casque, and sable plume,
    More glittering eye, and black brow's sabler gloom,
    Glared on the Moslems' eyes some Afrit Sprite,
    Whose demon death-blow left no hope for fight.
    The wild confusion, and the swarthy glow
    Of flames on high, and torches from below;
    The shriek of terror, and the mingling yell--
    For swords began to clash, and shouts to swell--
    Flung o'er that spot of earth the air of Hell!
    Distracted, to and fro, the flying slaves
    Behold but bloody shore and fiery waves;
    Nought heeded they the Pacha's angry cry,
    They seize that Dervise!--seize on Zatanai!
    He saw their terror--checked the first despair
    That urged him but to stand and perish there,
    Since far too early and too well obeyed,
    The flame was kindled ere the signal made;
    He saw their terror--from his baldric drew
    His bugle--brief the blast--but shrilly blew;
    'Tis answered--"Well ye speed, my gallant crew!
    Why did I doubt their quickness of career?
    And deem design had left me single here?"
    Sweeps his long arm--that sabre's whirling sway
    Sheds fast atonement for its first delay;
    Completes his fury, what their fear begun,
    And makes the many basely quail to one.
    The cloven turbans o'er the chamber spread,
    And scarce an arm dare rise to guard its head:
    Even Seyd, convulsed, o'erwhelmed, with rage, surprise,
    Retreats before him, though he still defies.
    No craven he--and yet he dreads the blow,
    So much Confusion magnifies his foe!
    His blazing galleys still distract his sight,
    He tore his beard, and foaming fled the fight;
    For now the pirates passed the Haram gate,
    And burst within--and it were death to wait;
    Where wild Amazement shrieking--kneeling--throws
    The sword aside--in vain--the blood o'erflows!
    The Corsairs pouring, haste to where within
    Invited Conrad's bugle, and the din
    Of groaning victims, and wild cries for life,
    Proclaimed how well he did the work of strife.
    They shout to find him grim and lonely there,
    A glutted tiger mangling in his lair!
    But short their greeting, shorter his reply--
    "'Tis well--but Seyd escapes--and he must die--
    Much hath been done--but more remains to do--
    Their galleys blaze--why not their city too?"

                    V.

    Quick at the word they seized him each a torch,
    And fire the dome from minaret to porch.
    A stern delight was fixed in Conrad's eye,
    But sudden sunk--for on his ear the cry
    Of women struck, and like a deadly knell
    Knocked at that heart unmoved by Battle's yell.
    "Oh! burst the Haram--wrong not on your lives
    One female form--remember--we have wives.
    On them such outrage Vengeance will repay;
    Man is our foe, and such 'tis ours to slay:
    But still we spared--must spare the weaker prey.
    Oh! I forgot--but Heaven will not forgive
    If at my word the helpless cease to live;
    Follow who will--I go--we yet have time
    Our souls to lighten of at least a crime."
    He climbs the crackling stair--he bursts the door,
    Nor feels his feet glow scorching with the floor;
    His breath choked gasping with the volumed smoke,
    But still from room to room his way he broke.
    They search--they find--they save: with lusty arms
    Each bears a prize of unregarded charms;
    Calm their loud fears; sustain their sinking frames
    With all the care defenceless Beauty claims:
    So well could Conrad tame their fiercest mood,
    And check the very hands with gore imbrued.
    But who is she? whom Conrad's arms convey,
    From reeking pile and combat's wreck, away--
    Who but the love of him he dooms to bleed?
    The Haram queen--but still the slave of Seyd!

                    VI.

    Brief time had Conrad now to greet Gulnare,
    Few words to reassure the trembling Fair;
    For in that pause Compassion snatched from War,
    The foe before retiring, fast and far,
    With wonder saw their footsteps unpursued,
    First slowlier fled--then rallied--then withstood.
    This Seyd perceives, then first perceives how few,
    Compared with his, the Corsair's roving crew,
    And blushes o'er his error, as he eyes
    The ruin wrought by Panic and Surprise.
    Alla il Alla! Vengeance swells the cry--
    Shame mounts to rage that must atone or die!
    And flame for flame and blood for blood must tell.
    The tide of triumph ebbs that flowed too well--
    When Wrath returns to renovated strife,
    And those who fought for conquest strike for life.
    Conrad beheld the danger--he beheld
    His followers faint by freshening foes repelled:
    "One effort--one--to break the circling host!"
    They form--unite--charge--waver--all is lost!
    Within a narrower ring compressed, beset,
    Hopeless, not heartless, strive and struggle yet--
    Ah! now they fight in firmest file no more,
    Hemmed in--cut off--cleft down and trampled o'er;
    But each strikes singly--silently--and home,
    And sinks outwearied rather than o'ercome--
    His last faint quittance rendering with his breath,
    Till the blade glimmers in the grasp of Death!

                    VII.

    But first, ere came the rallying host to blows,
    And rank to rank, and hand to hand oppose,
    Gulnare and all her Haram handmaids freed,
    Safe in the dome of one who held their creed,
    By Conrad's mandate safely were bestowed,
    And dried those tears for life and fame that flowed:
    And when that dark-eyed lady, young Gulnare,
    Recalled those thoughts late wandering in despair,
    Much did she marvel o'er the courtesy
    That smoothed his accents, softened in his eye--
    'Twas strange--that robber thus with gore bedewed,
    Seemed gentler then than Seyd in fondest mood.
    The Pacha wooed as if he deemed the slave
    Must seem delighted with the heart he gave;
    The Corsair vowed protection, soothed affright,
    As if his homage were a Woman's right.
    "The wish is wrong--nay, worse for female--vain:
    Yet much I long to view that Chief again;
    If but to thank for, what my fear forgot,
    The life--my loving Lord remembered not!"

                    VIII.

    And him she saw, where thickest carnage spread,
    But gathered breathing from the happier dead;
    Far from his band, and battling with a host
    That deem right dearly won the field he lost,
    Felled--bleeding--baffled of the death he sought,
    And snatched to expiate all the ills he wrought;
    Preserved to linger and to live in vain,
    While Vengeance pondered o'er new plans of pain,
    And stanched the blood she saves to shed again--
    But drop by drop, for Seyd's unglutted eye
    Would doom him ever dying--ne'er to die!
    Can this be he? triumphant late she saw,
    When his red hand's wild gesture waved, a law!
    'Tis he indeed--disarmed but undeprest,
    His sole regret the life he still possest;
    His wounds too slight, though taken with that will,
    Which would have kissed the hand that then could kill.
    Oh were there none, of all the many given,
    To send his soul--he scarcely asked to Heaven?
    Must he alone of all retain his breath,
    Who more than all had striven and struck for death?
    He deeply felt--what mortal hearts must feel,
    When thus reversed on faithless Fortune's wheel,
    For crimes committed, and the victor's threat
    Of lingering tortures to repay the debt--
    He deeply, darkly felt; but evil Pride
    That led to perpetrate--now serves to hide.
    Still in his stern and self-collected mien
    A conqueror's more than captive's air is seen,
    Though faint with wasting toil and stiffening wound,
    But few that saw--so calmly gazed around:
    Though the far shouting of the distant crowd,
    Their tremors o'er, rose insolently loud,
    The better warriors who beheld him near,
    Insulted not the foe who taught them fear;
    And the grim guards that to his durance led,
    In silence eyed him with a secret dread.

                    IX.

    The Leech was sent--but not in mercy--there,
    To note how much the life yet left could bear;
    He found enough to load with heaviest chain,
    And promise feeling for the wrench of Pain;
    To-morrow--yea--to-morrow's evening Sun
    Will, sinking, see Impalement's pangs begun,
    And rising with the wonted blush of morn
    Behold how well or ill those pangs are borne.
    Of torments this the longest and the worst,
    Which adds all other agony to thirst,
    That day by day Death still forbears to slake,
    While famished vultures flit around the stake.
    "Oh! water--water!"--smiling Hate denies
    The victim's prayer, for if he drinks he dies.
    This was his doom;--the Leech, the guard, were gone,
    And left proud Conrad fettered and alone.

                    X.

    'Twere vain to paint to what his feelings grew--
    It even were doubtful if their victim knew.
    There is a war, a chaos of the mind,
    When all its elements convulsed, combined
    Lie dark and jarring with perturbed force,
    And gnashing with impenitent Remorse--
    That juggling fiend, who never spake before,
    But cries "I warned thee!" when the deed is o'er.
    Vain voice! the spirit burning but unbent,
    May writhe--rebel--the weak alone repent!
    Even in that lonely hour when most it feels,
    And, to itself, all--all that self reveals,--
    No single passion, and no ruling thought
    That leaves the rest, as once, unseen, unsought,
    But the wild prospect when the Soul reviews,
    All rushing through their thousand avenues--
    Ambition's dreams expiring, Love's regret,
    Endangered Glory, Life itself beset;
    The joy untasted, the contempt or hate
    'Gainst those who fain would triumph in our fate;
    The hopeless past, the hasting future driven
    Too quickly on to guess if Hell or Heaven;
    Deeds--thoughts--and words, perhaps remembered not
    So keenly till that hour, but ne'er forgot;
    Things light or lovely in their acted time,
    But now to stern Reflection each a crime;
    The withering sense of Evil unrevealed,
    Not cankering less because the more concealed;
    All, in a word, from which all eyes must start,
    That opening sepulchre, the naked heart
    Bares with its buried woes--till Pride awake,
    To snatch the mirror from the soul, and break.
    Aye, Pride can veil, and Courage brave it all--
    All--all--before--beyond--the deadliest fall.
    Each hath some fear, and he who least betrays,
    The only hypocrite deserving praise:
    Not the loud recreant wretch who boasts and flies;
    But he who looks on Death--and silent dies:
    So, steeled by pondering o'er his far career,
    He half-way meets Him should He menace near!

                    XI.

    In the high chamber of his highest tower
    Sate Conrad, fettered in the Pacha's power.
    His palace perished in the flame--this fort
    Contained at once his captive and his court.
    Not much could Conrad of his sentence blame,
    His foe, if vanquished, had but shared the same:--
    Alone he sate--in solitude had scanned
    His guilty bosom, but that breast he manned:
    One thought alone he could not--dared not meet--
    "Oh, how these tidings will Medora greet?"
    Then--only then--his clanking hands he raised,
    And strained with rage the chain on which he gazed;
    But soon he found, or feigned, or dreamed relief,
    And smiled in self-derision of his grief,
    "And now come Torture when it will, or may--
    More need of rest to nerve me for the day!"
    This said, with langour to his mat he crept,
    And, whatso'er his visions, quickly slept.

    'Twas hardly midnight when that fray begun,
    For Conrad's plans matured, at once were done,
    And Havoc loathes so much the waste of time,
    She scarce had left an uncommitted crime.
    One hour beheld him since the tide he stemmed--
    Disguised--discovered--conquering--ta'en--condemned--
    A Chief on land--an outlaw on the deep--
    Destroying--saving--prisoned--and asleep!

                    XII.

    He slept in calmest seeming, for his breath
    Was hushed so deep--Ah! happy if in death!
    He slept--Who o'er his placid slumber bends?
    His foes are gone--and here he hath no friends;
    Is it some Seraph sent to grant him grace?
    No,'tis an earthly form with heavenly face!
    Its white arm raised a lamp--yet gently hid,
    Lest the ray flash abruptly on the lid
    Of that closed eye, which opens but to pain,
    And once unclosed--but once may close again.
    That form, with eye so dark, and cheek so fair,
    And auburn waves of gemmed and braided hair;
    With shape of fairy lightness--naked foot,
    That shines like snow, and falls on earth as mute--
    Through guards and dunnest night how came it there?
    Ah! rather ask what will not Woman dare?
    Whom Youth and Pity lead like thee, Gulnare!
    She could not sleep--and while the Pacha's rest
    In muttering dreams yet saw his pirate-guest,
    She left his side--his signet-ring she bore,
    Which oft in sport adorned her hand before--
    And with it, scarcely questioned, won her way
    Through drowsy guards that must that sign obey.
    Worn out with toil, and tired with changing blows,
    Their eyes had envied Conrad his repose;
    And chill and nodding at the turret door,
    They stretch their listless limbs, and watch no more;
    Just raised their heads to hail the signet-ring,
    Nor ask or what or who the sign may bring.

                    XIII.

    She gazed in wonder, "Can he calmly sleep,
    While other eyes his fall or ravage weep?
    And mine in restlessness are wandering here--
    What sudden spell hath made this man so dear?
    True--'tis to him my life, and more, I owe,
    And me and mine he spared from worse than woe:
    'Tis late to think--but soft--his slumber breaks--
    How heavily he sighs!--he starts--awakes!"
    He raised his head, and dazzled with the light,
    His eye seemed dubious if it saw aright:
    He moved his hand--the grating of his chain
    Too harshly told him that he lived again.
    "What is that form? if not a shape of air,
    Methinks, my jailor's face shows wondrous fair!"
    "Pirate! thou know'st me not, but I am one,
    Grateful for deeds thou hast too rarely done;
    Look on me--and remember her, thy hand
    Snatched from the flames, and thy more fearful band.
    I come through darkness--and I scarce know why--
    Yet not to hurt--I would not see thee die."

    "If so, kind lady! thine the only eye
    That would not here in that gay hope delight:
    Theirs is the chance--and let them use their right.
    But still I thank their courtesy or thine,
    That would confess me at so fair a shrine!"

    Strange though it seem--yet with extremest grief
    Is linked a mirth--it doth not bring relief--
    That playfulness of Sorrow ne'er beguiles,
    And smiles in bitterness--but still it smiles;
    And sometimes with the wisest and the best,
    Till even the scaffold echoes with their jest!
    Yet not the joy to which it seems akin--
    It may deceive all hearts, save that within.
    Whate'er it was that flashed on Conrad, now
    A laughing wildness half unbent his brow:
    And these his accents had a sound of mirth,
    As if the last he could enjoy on earth;
    Yet 'gainst his nature--for through that short life,
    Few thoughts had he to spare from gloom and strife.

                    XIV.

    "Corsair! thy doom is named--but I have power
    To soothe the Pacha in his weaker hour.
    Thee would I spare--nay more--would save thee now,
    But this--Time--Hope--nor even thy strength allow;
    But all I can,--I will--at least delay
    The sentence that remits thee scarce a day.
    More now were ruin--even thyself were loth
    The vain attempt should bring but doom to both."

    "Yes!--loth indeed:--my soul is nerved to all,
    Or fall'n too low to fear a further fall:
    Tempt not thyself with peril--me with hope
    Of flight from foes with whom I could not cope:
    Unfit to vanquish--shall I meanly fly,
    The one of all my band that would not die?
    Yet there is one--to whom my Memory clings,
    Till to these eyes her own wild softness springs.
    My sole resources in the path I trod
    Were these--my bark--my sword--my love--my God!
    The last I left in youth!--He leaves me now--
    And Man but works his will to lay me low.
    I have no thought to mock his throne with prayer
    Wrung from the coward crouching of Despair;
    It is enough--I breathe--and I can bear.
    My sword is shaken from the worthless hand
    That might have better kept so true a brand;
    My bark is sunk or captive--but my Love--
    For her in sooth my voice would mount above:
    Oh! she is all that still to earth can bind--
    And this will break a heart so more than kind,
    And blight a form--till thine appeared, Gulnare!
    Mine eye ne'er asked if others were as fair."

    "Thou lov'st another then?--but what to me
    Is this--'tis nothing--nothing e'er can be:
    But yet--thou lov'st--and--Oh! I envy those
    Whose hearts on hearts as faithful can repose,
    Who never feel the void--the wandering thought
    That sighs o'er visions--such as mine hath wrought."

    "Lady--methought thy love was his, for whom
    This arm redeemed thee from a fiery tomb."

    "My love stern Seyd's! Oh--No--No--not my love--
    Yet much this heart, that strives no more, once strove
    To meet his passion--but it would not be.
    I felt--I feel--Love dwells with--with the free.
    I am a slave, a favoured slave at best,
    To share his splendour, and seem very blest!
    Oft must my soul the question undergo,
    Of--'Dost thou love?' and burn to answer, 'No!'
    Oh! hard it is that fondness to sustain,
    And struggle not to feel averse in vain;
    But harder still the heart's recoil to bear,
    And hide from one--perhaps another there.
    He takes the hand I give not--nor withhold--
    Its pulse nor checked--nor quickened--calmly cold:
    And when resigned, it drops a lifeless weight
    From one I never loved enough to hate.
    No warmth these lips return by his imprest,
    And chilled Remembrance shudders o'er the rest.
    Yes--had I ever proved that Passion's zeal,
    The change to hatred were at least to feel:
    But still--he goes unmourned--returns unsought--
    And oft when present--absent from my thought.
    Or when Reflection comes--and come it must--
    I fear that henceforth 'twill but bring disgust;
    I am his slave--but, in despite of pride,
    'Twere worse than bondage to become his bride.
    Oh! that this dotage of his breast would cease!
    Or seek another and give mine release,
    But yesterday--I could have said, to peace!
    Yes, if unwonted fondness now I feign,
    Remember--Captive! 'tis to break thy chain;
    Repay the life that to thy hand I owe;
    To give thee back to all endeared below,
    Who share such love as I can never know.
    Farewell--Morn breaks--and I must now away:
    'Twill cost me dear--but dread no death to-day!"

                    XV.

    She pressed his fettered fingers to her heart,
    And bowed her head, and turned her to depart,
    And noiseless as a lovely dream is gone.
    And was she here? and is he now alone?
    What gem hath dropped and sparkles o'er his chain?
    The tear most sacred, shed for others' pain,
    That starts at once--bright--pure--from Pity's mine,
    Already polished by the hand divine!
    Oh! too convincing--dangerously dear--
    In Woman's eye the unanswerable tear!
    That weapon of her weakness she can wield,
    To save, subdue--at once her spear and shield:
    Avoid it--Virtue ebbs and Wisdom errs,
    Too fondly gazing on that grief of hers!
    What lost a world, and bade a hero fly?
    The timid tear in Cleopatra's eye.
    Yet be the soft Triumvir's fault forgiven;
    By this--how many lose not earth--but Heaven!
    Consign their souls to Man's eternal foe,
    And seal their own to spare some Wanton's woe!

                    XVI.

    'Tis Morn--and o'er his altered features play
    The beams--without the Hope of yesterday.
    What shall he be ere night? perchance a thing
    O'er which the raven flaps her funeral wing,
    By his closed eye unheeded and unfelt;
    While sets that Sun, and dews of Evening melt,
    Chill, wet, and misty round each stiffened limb,
    Refreshing earth--reviving all but him!

                      CANTO THE THIRD.

            "Come vedi--ancor non m'abbandona"
                         Dante, Inferno, v. 105.

                    I.

    Slow sinks, more lovely ere his race be run,
    Along Morea's hills the setting Sun;
    Not, as in Northern climes, obscurely bright,
    But one unclouded blaze of living light!
    O'er the hushed deep the yellow beam he throws,
    Gilds the green wave, that trembles as it glows.
    On old Aegina's rock, and Idra's isle,
    The God of gladness sheds his parting smile;
    O'er his own regions lingering, loves to shine,
    Though there his altars are no more divine.
    Descending fast the mountain shadows kiss
    Thy glorious gulf, unconquered Salamis!
    Their azure arches through the long expanse
    More deeply purpled met his mellowing glance,
    And tenderest tints, along their summits driven,
    Mark his gay course, and own the hues of Heaven;
    Till, darkly shaded from the land and deep,
    Behind his Delphian cliff he sinks to sleep.

    On such an eve, his palest beam he cast,
    When--Athens! here thy Wisest looked his last.
    How watched thy better sons his farewell ray,
    That closed their murdered Sage's latest day!
    Not yet--not yet--Sol pauses on the hill--
    The precious hour of parting lingers still;
    But sad his light to agonising eyes,
    And dark the mountain's once delightful dyes:
    Gloom o'er the lovely land he seemed to pour,
    The land, where Phoebus never frowned before:
    But ere he sunk below Cithaeron's head,
    The cup of woe was quaffed--the Spirit fled;
    The Soul of him who scorned to fear or fly--
    Who lived and died, as none can live or die!

    But lo! from high Hymettus to the plain,
    The Queen of night asserts her silent reign.
    No murky vapour, herald of the storm,
    Hides her fair face, nor girds her glowing form;
    With cornice glimmering as the moon-beams play,
    There the white column greets her grateful ray,
    And bright around with quivering beams beset,
    Her emblem sparkles o'er the Minaret:
    The groves of olive scattered dark and wide
    Where meek Cephisus pours his scanty tide;
    The cypress saddening by the sacred Mosque,
    The gleaming turret of the gay Kiosk;
    And, dun and sombre 'mid the holy calm,
    Near Theseus' fane yon solitary palm,
    All tinged with varied hues arrest the eye--
    And dull were his that passed him heedless by.

    Again the Aegean, heard no more afar,
    Lulls his chafed breast from elemental war;
    Again his waves in milder tints unfold
    Their long array of sapphire and of gold,
    Mixed with the shades of many a distant isle,
    That frown--where gentler Ocean seems to smile.

                    II.

    Not now my theme--why turn my thoughts to thee?
    Oh! who can look along thy native sea,
    Nor dwell upon thy name, whate'er the tale,
    So much its magic must o'er all prevail?
    Who that beheld that Sun upon thee set,
    Fair Athens! could thine evening face forget?
    Not he--whose heart nor time nor distance frees,
    Spell-bound within the clustering Cyclades!
    Nor seems this homage foreign to its strain,
    His Corsair's isle was once thine own domain--
    Would that with freedom it were thine again!

                    III.

    The Sun hath sunk--and, darker than the night,
    Sinks with its beam upon the beacon height
    Medora's heart--the third day's come and gone--
    With it he comes not--sends not--faithless one!
    The wind was fair though light! and storms were none.
    Last eve Anselmo's bark returned, and yet
    His only tidings that they had not met!
    Though wild, as now, far different were the tale
    Had Conrad waited for that single sail.
    The night-breeze freshens--she that day had passed
    In watching all that Hope proclaimed a mast;
    Sadly she sate on high--Impatience bore
    At last her footsteps to the midnight shore,
    And there she wandered, heedless of the spray
    That dashed her garments oft, and warned away:
    She saw not, felt not this--nor dared depart,
    Nor deemed it cold--her chill was at her heart;
    Till grew such certainty from that suspense--
    His very Sight had shocked from life or sense!

    It came at last--a sad and shattered boat,
    Whose inmates first beheld whom first they sought;
    Some bleeding--all most wretched--these the few--
    Scarce knew they how escaped--this all they knew.
    In silence, darkling, each appeared to wait
    His fellow's mournful guess at Conrad's fate:
    Something they would have said; but seemed to fear
    To trust their accents to Medora's ear.
    She saw at once, yet sunk not--trembled not--
    Beneath that grief, that loneliness of lot,
    Within that meek fair form, were feelings high,
    That deemed not till they found their energy.
    While yet was Hope they softened, fluttered, wept--
    All lost--that Softness died not--but it slept;
    And o'er its slumber rose that Strength which said,
    "With nothing left to love, there's nought to dread."
    'Tis more than Nature's--like the burning might
    Delirium gathers from the fever's height.

    "Silent you stand--nor would I hear you tell
    What--speak not--breathe not--for I know it well--
    Yet would I ask--almost my lip denies
    The--quick your answer--tell me where he lies."

    "Lady! we know not--scarce with life we fled;
    But here is one denies that he is dead:
    He saw him bound; and bleeding--but alive."

    She heard no further--'twas in vain to strive--
    So throbbed each vein--each thought--till then withstood;
    Her own dark soul--these words at once subdued:
    She totters--falls--and senseless had the wave
    Perchance but snatched her from another grave;
    But that with hands though rude, yet weeping eyes,
    They yield such aid as Pity's haste supplies:
    Dash o'er her deathlike cheek the ocean dew,
    Raise, fan, sustain--till life returns anew;
    Awake her handmaids, with the matrons leave
    That fainting form o'er which they gaze and grieve;
    Then seek Anselmo's cavern, to report
    The tale too tedious--when the triumph short.

                    IV.

    In that wild council words waxed warm and strange,
    With thoughts of ransom, rescue, and revenge;
    All, save repose or flight: still lingering there
    Breathed Conrad's spirit, and forbade despair;
    Whate'er his fate--the breasts he formed and led
    Will save him living, or appease him dead.
    Woe to his foes! there yet survive a few,
    Whose deeds are daring, as their hearts are true.

                    V.

    Within the Haram's secret chamber sate
    Stern Seyd, still pondering o'er his Captive's fate;
    His thoughts on love and hate alternate dwell,
    Now with Gulnare, and now in Conrad's cell;
    Here at his feet the lovely slave reclined
    Surveys his brow--would soothe his gloom of mind;
    While many an anxious glance her large dark eye
    Sends in its idle search for sympathy,
    His only bends in seeming o'er his beads,
    But inly views his victim as he bleeds.

    "Pacha! the day is thine; and on thy crest
    Sits Triumph--Conrad taken--fall'n the rest!
    His doom is fixed--he dies; and well his fate
    Was earned--yet much too worthless for thy hate:
    Methinks, a short release, for ransom told
    With all his treasure, not unwisely sold;
    Report speaks largely of his pirate-hoard--
    Would that of this my Pacha were the lord!
    While baffled, weakened by this fatal fray--
    Watched--followed--he were then an easier prey;
    But once cut off--the remnant of his band
    Embark their wealth, and seek a safer strand."

    "Gulnare!--if for each drop of blood a gem
    Where offered rich as Stamboul's diadem;
    If for each hair of his a massy mine
    Of virgin ore should supplicating shine;
    If all our Arab tales divulge or dream
    Of wealth were here--that gold should not redeem!
    It had not now redeemed a single hour,
    But that I know him fettered, in my power;
    And, thirsting for revenge, I ponder still
    On pangs that longest rack--and latest kill."

    "Nay, Seyd! I seek not to restrain thy rage,
    Too justly moved for Mercy to assuage;
    My thoughts were only to secure for thee
    His riches--thus released, he were not free:
    Disabled--shorn of half his might and band,
    His capture could but wait thy first command."

    "His capture could!--and shall I then resign
    One day to him--the wretch already mine?
    Release my foe!--at whose remonstrance?--thine!
    Fair suitor!--to thy virtuous gratitude,
    That thus repays this Giaour's relenting mood,
    Which thee and thine alone of all could spare--
    No doubt, regardless--if the prize were fair--
    My thanks and praise alike are due--now hear!
    I have a counsel for thy gentler ear:
    I do mistrust thee, Woman! and each word
    Of thine stamps truth on all Suspicion heard.
    Borne in his arms through fire from yon Serai--
    Say, wert thou lingering there with him to fly?
    Thou need'st not answer--thy confession speaks,
    Already reddening on thy guilty cheeks:
    Then--lovely Dame--bethink thee! and beware:
    'Tis not his life alone may claim such care!
    Another word and--nay--I need no more.
    Accursed was the moment when he bore
    Thee from the flames, which better far--but no--
    I then had mourned thee with a lover's woe--
    Now 'tis thy lord that warns--deceitful thing!
    Know'st thou that I can clip thy wanton wing?
    In words alone I am not wont to chafe:
    Look to thyself--nor deem thy falsehood safe!"

    He rose--and slowly, sternly thence withdrew,
    Rage in his eye, and threats in his adieu:
    Ah! little recked that Chief of womanhood--
    Which frowns ne'er quelled, nor menaces subdued;
    And little deemed he what thy heart, Gulnare!
    When soft could feel--and when incensed could dare!
    His doubts appeared to wrong--nor yet she knew
    How deep the root from whence Compassion grew--
    She was a slave--from such may captives claim
    A fellow-feeling, differing but in name;
    Still half unconscious--heedless of his wrath,
    Again she ventured on the dangerous path,
    Again his rage repelled--until arose
    That strife of thought, the source of Woman's woes!

                    VI.

    Meanwhile--long--anxious--weary--still the same
    Rolled day and night: his soul could Terror tame--
    This fearful interval of doubt and dread,
    When every hour might doom him worse than dead;
    When every step that echoed by the gate,
    Might entering lead where axe and stake await;
    When every voice that grated on his ear
    Might be the last that he could ever hear;
    Could Terror tame--that Spirit stern and high
    Had proved unwilling as unfit to die;
    'Twas worn--perhaps decayed--yet silent bore
    That conflict, deadlier far than all before:
    The heat of fight, the hurry of the gale,
    Leave scarce one thought inert enough to quail:
    But bound and fixed in fettered solitude,
    To pine, the prey of every changing mood;
    To gaze on thine own heart--and meditate
    Irrevocable faults, and coming fate--
    Too late the last to shun--the first to mend--
    To count the hours that struggle to thine end,
    With not a friend to animate and tell
    To other ears that Death became thee well;
    Around thee foes to forge the ready lie,
    And blot Life's latest scene with calumny;
    Before thee tortures, which the Soul can dare,
    Yet doubts how well the shrinking flesh may bear;
    But deeply feels a single cry would shame,
    To Valour's praise thy last and dearest claim;
    The life thou leav'st below, denied above
    By kind monopolists of heavenly love;
    And more than doubtful Paradise--thy Heaven
    Of earthly hope--thy loved one from thee riven.
    Such were the thoughts that outlaw must sustain,
    And govern pangs surpassing mortal pain:
    And those sustained he--boots it well or ill?
    Since not to sink beneath, is something still!

                    VII.

    The first day passed--he saw not her--Gulnare--
    The second, third--and still she came not there;
    But what her words avouched, her charms had done,
    Or else he had not seen another Sun.
    The fourth day rolled along, and with the night
    Came storm and darkness in their mingling might.
    Oh! how he listened to the rushing deep,
    That ne'er till now so broke upon his sleep;
    And his wild Spirit wilder wishes sent,
    Roused by the roar of his own element!
    Oft had he ridden on that winged wave,
    And loved its roughness for the speed it gave;
    And now its dashing echoed on his ear,
    A long known voice--alas! too vainly near!
    Loud sung the wind above; and, doubly loud,
    Shook o'er his turret cell the thunder-cloud;
    And flashed the lightning by the latticed bar,
    To him more genial than the Midnight Star:
    Close to the glimmering grate he dragged his chain,
    And hoped that peril might not prove in vain.
    He rais'd his iron hand to Heaven, and prayed
    One pitying flash to mar the form it made:
    His steel and impious prayer attract alike--
    The storm rolled onward, and disdained to strike;
    Its peal waxed fainter--ceased--he felt alone,
    As if some faithless friend had spurned his groan!

                    VIII.

    The midnight passed, and to the massy door
    A light step came--it paused--it moved once more;
    Slow turns the grating bolt and sullen key:
    'Tis as his heart foreboded--that fair She!
    Whate'er her sins, to him a Guardian Saint,
    And beauteous still as hermit's hope can paint;
    Yet changed since last within that cell she came,
    More pale her cheek, more tremulous her frame:
    On him she cast her dark and hurried eye,
    Which spoke before her accents--"Thou must die!
    Yes, thou must die--there is but one resource,
    The last--the worst--if torture were not worse."

    "Lady! I look to none; my lips proclaim
    What last proclaimed they--Conrad still the same:
    Why should'st thou seek an outlaw's life to spare,
    And change the sentence I deserve to bear?
    Well have I earned--nor here alone--the meed
    Of Seyd's revenge, by many a lawless deed."

    "Why should I seek? because--Oh! did'st thou not
    Redeem my life from worse than Slavery's lot?
    Why should I seek?--hath Misery made thee blind
    To the fond workings of a woman's mind?
    And must I say?--albeit my heart rebel
    With all that Woman feels, but should not tell--
    Because--despite thy crimes--that heart is moved:
    It feared thee--thanked thee--pitied--maddened--loved.
    Reply not, tell not now thy tale again,
    Thou lov'st another--and I love in vain:
    Though fond as mine her bosom, form more fair,
    I rush through peril which she would not dare.
    If that thy heart to hers were truly dear,
    Were I thine own--thou wert not lonely here:
    An outlaw's spouse--and leave her Lord to roam!
    What hath such gentle dame to do with home?
    But speak not now--o'er thine and o'er my head
    Hangs the keen sabre by a single thread;
    If thou hast courage still, and would'st be free,
    Receive this poniard--rise and follow me!"

    "Aye--in my chains! my steps will gently tread,
    With these adornments, o'er such slumbering head!
    Thou hast forgot--is this a garb for flight?
    Or is that instrument more fit for fight?"

    "Misdoubting Corsair! I have gained the guard,
    Ripe for revolt, and greedy for reward.
    A single word of mine removes that chain:
    Without some aid how here could I remain?
    Well, since we met, hath sped my busy time,
    If in aught evil, for thy sake the crime:
    The crime--'tis none to punish those of Seyd.
    That hatred tyrant, Conrad--he must bleed!
    I see thee shudder, but my soul is changed--
    Wronged--spurned--reviled--and it shall be avenged--
    Accused of what till now my heart disdained--
    Too faithful, though to bitter bondage chained.
    Yes, smile!--but he had little cause to sneer,
    I was not treacherous then, nor thou too dear:
    But he has said it--and the jealous well,--
    Those tyrants--teasing--tempting to rebel,--
    Deserve the fate their fretting lips foretell.
    I never loved--he bought me--somewhat high--
    Since with me came a heart he could not buy.
    I was a slave unmurmuring; he hath said,
    But for his rescue I with thee had fled.
    'Twas false thou know'st--but let such Augurs rue,
    Their words are omens Insult renders true.
    Nor was thy respite granted to my prayer;
    This fleeting grace was only to prepare
    New torments for thy life, and my despair.
    Mine too he threatens; but his dotage still
    Would fain reserve me for his lordly will:
    When wearier of these fleeting charms and me,
    There yawns the sack--and yonder rolls the sea!
    What, am I then a toy for dotard's play,
    To wear but till the gilding frets away?
    I saw thee--loved thee--owe thee all--would save,
    If but to show how grateful is a slave.
    But had he not thus menaced fame and life,--
    And well he keeps his oaths pronounced in strife--
    I still had saved thee--but the Pacha spared:
    Now I am all thine own--for all prepared:
    Thou lov'st me not--nor know'st--or but the worst.
    Alas! this love--that hatred--are the first--
    Oh! could'st thou prove my truth, thou would'st not start,
    Nor fear the fire that lights an Eastern heart;
    'Tis now the beacon of thy safety--now
    It points within the port a Mainote prow:
    But in one chamber, where our path must lead,
    There sleeps--he must not wake--the oppressor Seyd!"

    "Gulnare--Gulnare--I never felt till now
    My abject fortune, withered fame so low:
    Seyd is mine enemy; had swept my band
    From earth with ruthless but with open hand,
    And therefore came I, in my bark of war,
    To smite the smiter with the scimitar;
    Such is my weapon--not the secret knife;
    Who spares a Woman's seeks not Slumber's life.
    Thine saved I gladly, Lady--not for this;
    Let me not deem that mercy shown amiss.
    Now fare thee well--more peace be with thy breast!
    Night wears apace, my last of earthly rest!"

    "Rest! rest! by sunrise must thy sinews shake,
    And thy limbs writhe around the ready stake,
    I heard the order--saw--I will not see--
    If thou wilt perish, I will fall with thee.
    My life--my love--my hatred--all below
    Are on this cast--Corsair! 'tis but a blow!
    Without it flight were idle--how evade
    His sure pursuit?--my wrongs too unrepaid,
    My youth disgraced--the long, long wasted years,
    One blow shall cancel with our future fears;
    But since the dagger suits thee less than brand,
    I'll try the firmness of a female hand.
    The guards are gained--one moment all were o'er--
    Corsair! we meet in safety or no more;
    If errs my feeble hand, the morning cloud
    Will hover o'er thy scaffold, and my shroud."

                    IX.

    She turned, and vanished ere he could reply,
    But his glance followed far with eager eye;
    And gathering, as he could, the links that bound
    His form, to curl their length, and curb their sound,
    Since bar and bolt no more his steps preclude,
    He, fast as fettered limbs allow, pursued.
    'Twas dark and winding, and he knew not where
    That passage led; nor lamp nor guard was there:
    He sees a dusky glimmering--shall he seek
    Or shun that ray so indistinct and weak?
    Chance guides his steps--a freshness seems to bear
    Full on his brow as if from morning air;
    He reached an open gallery--on his eye
    Gleamed the last star of night, the clearing sky:
    Yet scarcely heeded these--another light
    From a lone chamber struck upon his sight.
    Towards it he moved; a scarcely closing door
    Revealed the ray within, but nothing more.
    With hasty step a figure outward passed,
    Then paused, and turned--and paused--'tis She at last!
    No poniard in that hand, nor sign of ill--
    "Thanks to that softening heart--she could not kill!"
    Again he looked, the wildness of her eye
    Starts from the day abrupt and fearfully.
    She stopped--threw back her dark far-floating hair,
    That nearly veiled her face and bosom fair,
    As if she late had bent her leaning head
    Above some object of her doubt or dread.
    They meet--upon her brow--unknown--forgot--
    Her hurrying hand had left--'twas but a spot--
    Its hue was all he saw, and scarce withstood--
    Oh! slight but certain pledge of crime--'tis Blood!

                    X.

    He had seen battle--he had brooded lone
    O'er promised pangs to sentenced Guilt foreshown;
    He had been tempted--chastened--and the chain
    Yet on his arms might ever there remain:
    But ne'er from strife--captivity--remorse--
    From all his feelings in their inmost force--
    So thrilled, so shuddered every creeping vein,
    As now they froze before that purple stain.
    That spot of blood, that light but guilty streak,
    Had banished all the beauty from her cheek!
    Blood he had viewed--could view unmoved--but then
    It flowed in combat, or was shed by men!

                    XI.

    "'Tis done--he nearly waked--but it is done.
    Corsair! he perished--thou art dearly won.
    All words would now be vain--away--away!
    Our bark is tossing--'tis already day.
    The few gained over, now are wholly mine,
    And these thy yet surviving band shall join:
    Anon my voice shall vindicate my hand,
    When once our sail forsakes this hated strand."

                    XII.

    She clapped her hands, and through the gallery pour,
    Equipped for flight, her vassals--Greek and Moor;
    Silent but quick they stoop, his chains unbind;
    Once more his limbs are free as mountain wind!
    But on his heavy heart such sadness sate,
    As if they there transferred that iron weight.
    No words are uttered--at her sign, a door
    Reveals the secret passage to the shore;
    The city lies behind--they speed, they reach
    The glad waves dancing on the yellow beach;
    And Conrad following, at her beck, obeyed,
    Nor cared he now if rescued or betrayed;
    Resistance were as useless as if Seyd
    Yet lived to view the doom his ire decreed.

                    XIII.

    Embarked--the sail unfurled--the light breeze blew--
    How much had Conrad's memory to review!
    Sunk he in contemplation, till the Cape
    Where last he anchored reared its giant shape.
    Ah!--since that fatal night, though brief the time,
    Had swept an age of terror, grief, and crime.
    As its far shadow frowned above the mast,
    He veiled his face, and sorrowed as he passed;
    He thought of all--Gonsalvo and his band,
    His fleeting triumph and his failing hand;
    He thought on her afar, his lonely bride:
    He turned and saw--Gulnare, the Homicide!

                    XIV.

    She watched his features till she could not bear
    Their freezing aspect and averted air;
    And that strange fierceness foreign to her eye
    Fell quenched in tears, too late to shed or dry.
    She knelt beside him and his hand she pressed,
    "Thou may'st forgive though Allah's self detest;
    But for that deed of darkness what wert thou?
    Reproach me--but not yet--Oh! spare me now!
    I am not what I seem--this fearful night
    My brain bewildered--do not madden quite!
    If I had never loved--though less my guilt--
    Thou hadst not lived to--hate me--if thou wilt."

                    XV.

    She wrongs his thoughts--they more himself upbraid
    Than her--though undesigned--the wretch he made;
    But speechless all, deep, dark, and unexprest,
    They bleed within that silent cell--his breast.
    Still onward, fair the breeze, nor rough the surge,
    The blue waves sport around the stern they urge;
    Far on the Horizon's verge appears a speck,
    A spot--a mast--a sail--an armed deck!
    Their little bark her men of watch descry,
    And ampler canvass woos the wind from high;
    She bears her down majestically near,
    Speed on her prow, and terror in her tier;
    A flash is seen--the ball beyond her bow
    Booms harmless, hissing to the deep below.
    Up rose keen Conrad from his silent trance,
    A long, long absent gladness in his glance;
    "'Tis mine--my blood-rag flag! again--again--
    I am not all deserted on the main!"
    They own the signal, answer to the hail,
    Hoist out the boat at once, and slacken sail.
    "'Tis Conrad! Conrad!" shouting from the deck,
    Command nor Duty could their transport check!
    With light alacrity and gaze of Pride,
    They view him mount once more his vessel's side;
    A smile relaxing in each rugged face,
    Their arms can scarce forbear a rough embrace.
    He, half forgetting danger and defeat,
    Returns their greeting as a Chief may greet,
    Wrings with a cordial grasp Anselmo's hand,
    And feels he yet can conquer and command!

                    XVI.

    These greetings o'er, the feelings that o'erflow,
    Yet grieve to win him back without a blow;
    They sailed prepared for vengeance--had they known
    A woman's hand secured that deed her own,
    She were their Queen--less scrupulous are they
    Than haughty Conrad how they win their way.
    With many an asking smile, and wondering stare,
    They whisper round, and gaze upon Gulnare;
    And her, at once above--beneath her sex,
    Whom blood appalled not, their regards perplex.
    To Conrad turns her faint imploring eye,
    She drops her veil, and stands in silence by;
    Her arms are meekly folded on that breast,
    Which--Conrad safe--to Fate resigned the rest.
    Though worse than frenzy could that bosom fill,
    Extreme in love or hate, in good or ill,
    The worst of crimes had left her Woman still!

                    XVII.

    This Conrad marked, and felt--ah! could he less?--
    Hate of that deed--but grief for her distress;
    What she has done no tears can wash away,
    And Heaven must punish on its angry day:
    But--it was done: he knew, whate'er her guilt,
    For him that poniard smote, that blood was spilt;
    And he was free!--and she for him had given
    Her all on earth, and more than all in heaven!
    And now he turned him to that dark-eyed slave
    Whose brow was bowed beneath the glance he gave,
    Who now seemed changed and humbled, faint and meek,
    But varying oft the colour of her cheek
    To deeper shades of paleness--all its red
    That fearful spot which stained it from the dead!
    He took that hand--it trembled--now too late--
    So soft in love--so wildly nerved in hate;
    He clasped that hand--it trembled--and his own
    Had lost its firmness, and his voice its tone.
    "Gulnare!"--but she replied not--"dear Gulnare!"
    She raised her eye--her only answer there--
    At once she sought and sunk in his embrace:
    If he had driven her from that resting-place,
    His had been more or less than mortal heart,
    But--good or ill--it bade her not depart.
    Perchance, but for the bodings of his breast,
    His latest virtue then had joined the rest.
    Yet even Medora might forgive the kiss
    That asked from form so fair no more than this,
    The first, the last that Frailty stole from Faith--
    To lips where Love had lavished all his breath,
    To lips--whose broken sighs such fragrance fling,
    As he had fanned them freshly with his wing!

                    XVIII.

    They gain by twilight's hour their lonely isle.
    To them the very rocks appear to smile;
    The haven hums with many a cheering sound,
    The beacons blaze their wonted stations round,
    The boats are darting o'er the curly bay,
    And sportive Dolphins bend them through the spray;
    Even the hoarse sea-bird's shrill, discordant shriek,
    Greets like the welcome of his tuneless beak!
    Beneath each lamp that through its lattice gleams,
    Their fancy paints the friends that trim the beams.
    Oh! what can sanctify the joys of home,
    Like Hope's gay glance from Ocean's troubled foam?

                    XIX.

    The lights are high on beacon and from bower,
    And 'midst them Conrad seeks Medora's tower:
    He looks in vain--'tis strange--and all remark,
    Amid so many, hers alone is dark.
    'Tis strange--of yore its welcome never failed,
    Nor now, perchance, extinguished--only veiled.
    With the first boat descends he for the shore,
    And looks impatient on the lingering oar.
    Oh! for a wing beyond the falcon's flight,
    To bear him like an arrow to that height!
    With the first pause the resting rowers gave,
    He waits not--looks not--leaps into the wave,
    Strives through the surge, bestrides the beach, and high
    Ascends the path familiar to his eye.

    He reached his turret door--he paused--no sound
    Broke from within; and all was night around.
    He knocked, and loudly--footstep nor reply
    Announced that any heard or deemed him nigh:
    He knocked, but faintly--for his trembling hand
    Refused to aid his heavy heart's demand.
    The portal opens--'tis a well known face--
    But not the form he panted to embrace.
    Its lips are silent--twice his own essayed,
    And failed to frame the question they delayed;
    He snatched the lamp--its light will answer all--
    It quits his grasp, expiring in the fall.
    He would not wait for that reviving ray--
    As soon could he have lingered there for day;
    But, glimmering through the dusky corridor,
    Another chequers o'er the shadowed floor;
    His steps the chamber gain--his eyes behold
    All that his heart believed not--yet foretold!

                    XX.

    He turned not--spoke not--sunk not--fixed his look,
    And set the anxious frame that lately shook:
    He gazed--how long we gaze despite of pain,
    And know, but dare not own, we gaze in vain!
    In life itself she was so still and fair,
    That Death with gentler aspect withered there;
    And the cold flowers her colder hand contained,
    In that last grasp as tenderly were strained
    As if she scarcely felt, but feigned a sleep--
    And made it almost mockery yet to weep:
    The long dark lashes fringed her lids of snow,
    And veiled--Thought shrinks from all that lurked below--Oh!
    o'er the eye Death most exerts his might,
    And hurls the Spirit from her throne of light;
    Sinks those blue orbs in that long last eclipse,
    But spares, as yet, the charm around her lips--
    Yet, yet they seem as they forebore to smile,
    And wished repose,--but only for a while;
    But the white shroud, and each extended tress,
    Long, fair--but spread in utter lifelessness,
    Which, late the sport of every summer wind,
    Escaped the baffled wreath that strove to bind;
    These--and the pale pure cheek, became the bier--
    But She is nothing--wherefore is he here?

                    XXI.

    He asked no question--all were answered now
    By the first glance on that still, marble brow.
    It was enough--she died--what recked it how?
    The love of youth, the hope of better years,
    The source of softest wishes, tenderest fears,
    The only living thing he could not hate,
    Was reft at once--and he deserved his fate,
    But did not feel it less;--the Good explore,
    For peace, those realms where Guilt can never soar:
    The proud, the wayward--who have fixed below
    Their joy, and find this earth enough for woe,
    Lose in that one their all--perchance a mite--
    But who in patience parts with all delight?
    Full many a stoic eye and aspect stern
    Mask hearts where Grief hath little left to learn;
    And many a withering thought lies hid, not lost,
    In smiles that least befit who wear them most.

                    XXII.

    By those, that deepest feel, is ill exprest
    The indistinctness of the suffering breast;
    Where thousand thoughts begin to end in one,
    Which seeks from all the refuge found in none;
    No words suffice the secret soul to show,
    For Truth denies all eloquence to Woe.
    On Conrad's stricken soul Exhaustion prest,
    And Stupor almost lulled it into rest;
    So feeble now--his mother's softness crept
    To those wild eyes, which like an infant's wept:
    It was the very weakness of his brain,
    Which thus confessed without relieving pain.
    None saw his trickling tears--perchance, if seen,
    That useless flood of grief had never been:
    Nor long they flowed--he dried them to depart,
    In helpless--hopeless--brokenness of heart:
    The Sun goes forth, but Conrad's day is dim:
    And the night cometh--ne'er to pass from him.
    There is no darkness like the cloud of mind,
    On Grief's vain eye--the blindest of the blind!
    Which may not--dare not see--but turns aside
    To blackest shade--nor will endure a guide!

                    XXIII.

    His heart was formed for softness--warped to wrong,
    Betrayed too early, and beguiled too long;
    Each feeling pure--as falls the dropping dew
    Within the grot--like that had hardened too;
    Less clear, perchance, its earthly trials passed,
    But sunk, and chilled, and petrified at last.
    Yet tempests wear, and lightning cleaves the rock;
    If such his heart, so shattered it the shock.
    There grew one flower beneath its rugged brow,
    Though dark the shade--it sheltered--saved till now.
    The thunder came--that bolt hath blasted both,
    The Granite's firmness, and the Lily's growth:
    The gentle plant hath left no leaf to tell
    Its tale, but shrunk and withered where it fell;
    And of its cold protector, blacken round
    But shivered fragments on the barren ground!

                    XXIV.

    'Tis morn--to venture on his lonely hour
    Few dare; though now Anselmo sought his tower.
    He was not there, nor seen along the shore;
    Ere night, alarmed, their isle is traversed o'er:
    Another morn--another bids them seek,
    And shout his name till Echo waxeth weak;
    Mount--grotto--cavern--valley searched in vain,
    They find on shore a sea-boat's broken chain:
    Their hope revives--they follow o'er the main.
    'Tis idle all--moons roll on moons away,
    And Conrad comes not, came not since that day:
    Nor trace nor tidings of his doom declare
    Where lives his grief, or perished his despair!
    Long mourned his band whom none could mourn beside;
    And fair the monument they gave his Bride:
    For him they raise not the recording stone--
    His death yet dubious, deeds too widely known;
    He left a Corsair's name to other times,
    Linked with one virtue, and a thousand crimes.

                ODE TO NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE.

                    I.

    'Tis done--but yesterday a King!
      And armed with Kings to strive--
    And now thou art a nameless thing:
      So abject--yet alive!
    Is this the man of thousand thrones,
    Who strewed our earth with hostile bones,
      And can he thus survive?
    Since he, miscalled the Morning Star,
    Nor man nor fiend hath fallen so far.

                    II.

    Ill-minded man! why scourge thy kind
      Who bowed so low the knee?
    By gazing on thyself grown blind,
      Thou taught'st the rest to see.
    With might unquestioned,--power to save,--
    Thine only gift hath been the grave
      To those that worshipped thee;
    Nor till thy fall could mortals guess
    Ambition's less than littleness!

                    III.

    Thanks for that lesson--it will teach
      To after-warriors more
    Than high Philosophy can preach,
      And vainly preached before.
    That spell upon the minds of men
    Breaks never to unite again,
      That led them to adore
    Those Pagod things of sabre-sway,
    With fronts of brass, and feet of clay.

                    IV.

    The triumph, and the vanity,
      The rapture of the strife--
    The earthquake-voice of Victory,
      To thee the breath of life;
    The sword, the sceptre, and that sway
    Which man seemed made but to obey,
      Wherewith renown was rife--
    All quelled!--Dark Spirit! what must be
    The madness of thy memory!

                    V.

    The Desolator desolate!
      The Victor overthrown!
    The Arbiter of others' fate
      A Suppliant for his own!
    Is it some yet imperial hope
    That with such change can calmly cope?
      Or dread of death alone?
    To die a Prince--or live a slave--
    Thy choice is most ignobly brave!

                    VI.

    He who of old would rend the oak,
      Dreamed not of the rebound;
    Chained by the trunk he vainly broke--
      Alone--how looked he round?
    Thou, in the sternness of thy strength,
    An equal deed hast done at length.
      And darker fate hast found:
    He fell, the forest prowlers' prey;
    But thou must eat thy heart away!

                    VII.

    The Roman, when his burning heart
      Was slaked with blood of Rome,
    Threw down the dagger--dared depart,
      In savage grandeur, home.--
    He dared depart in utter scorn
    Of men that such a yoke had borne,
      Yet left him such a doom!
    His only glory was that hour
    Of self-upheld abandoned power.

                    VIII.

    The Spaniard, when the lust of sway
      Had lost its quickening spell,
    Cast crowns for rosaries away,
      An empire for a cell;
    A strict accountant of his beads,
    A subtle disputant on creeds,
      His dotage trifled well:
    Yet better had he neither known
    A bigot's shrine, nor despot's throne.

                    IX.

    But thou--from thy reluctant hand
      The thunderbolt is wrung--
    Too late thou leav'st the high command
      To which thy weakness clung;
    All Evil Spirit as thou art,
    It is enough to grieve the heart
      To see thine own unstrung;
    To think that God's fair world hath been
    The footstool of a thing so mean;

                    X.

    And Earth hath spilt her blood for him,
      Who thus can hoard his own!
    And Monarchs bowed the trembling limb,
      And thanked him for a throne!
    Fair Freedom! we may hold thee dear,
    When thus thy mightiest foes their fear
      In humblest guise have shown.
    Oh! ne'er may tyrant leave behind
    A brighter name to lure mankind!

                    XI.

    Thine evil deeds are writ in gore,
      Nor written thus in vain--
    Thy triumphs tell of fame no more,
      Or deepen every stain:
    If thou hadst died as Honour dies,
    Some new Napoleon might arise,
      To shame the world again--
    But who would soar the solar height,
    To set in such a starless night?

                    XII.

    Weigh'd in the balance, hero dust
      Is vile as vulgar clay;
    Thy scales, Mortality! are just
      To all that pass away:
    But yet methought the living great
    Some higher sparks should animate,
      To dazzle and dismay:
    Nor deem'd Contempt could thus make mirth
    Of these, the Conquerors of the earth.

                    XIII.

    And she, proud Austria's mournful flower,
      Thy still imperial bride;
    How bears her breast the torturing hour?
      Still clings she to thy side?
    Must she too bend, must she too share
    Thy late repentance, long despair,
      Thou throneless Homicide?
    If still she loves thee, hoard that gem,--
    'Tis worth thy vanished diadem!

                    XIV.

    Then haste thee to thy sullen Isle,
      And gaze upon the sea;
    That element may meet thy smile--
      It ne'er was ruled by thee!
    Or trace with thine all idle hand
    In loitering mood upon the sand
      That Earth is now as free!
    That Corinth's pedagogue hath now
    Transferred his by-word to thy brow.

                    XV.

    Thou Timour! in his captive's cage
      What thoughts will there be thine,
    While brooding in thy prisoned rage?
      But one--"The world was mine!"
    Unless, like he of Babylon,
    All sense is with thy sceptre gone,
      Life will not long confine
    That spirit poured so widely forth--
    So long obeyed--so little worth!

                    XVI.

    Or, like the thief of fire from heaven,
      Wilt thou withstand the shock?
    And share with him, the unforgiven,
      His vulture and his rock!
    Foredoomed by God--by man accurst,
    And that last act, though not thy worst,
      The very Fiend's arch mock;
    He in his fall preserved his pride,
    And, if a mortal, had as proudly died!

                    XVII.

    There was a day--there was an hour,
      While earth was Gaul's--Gaul thine--
    When that immeasurable power
      Unsated to resign
    Had been an act of purer fame
    Than gathers round Marengo's name
      And gilded thy decline,
    Through the long twilight of all time,
    Despite some passing clouds of crime.

                    XVIII.

    But thou forsooth must be a King
      And don the purple vest,
    As if that foolish robe could wring
      Remembrance from thy breast.
    Where is that faded garment? where
    The gewgaws thou wert fond to wear,
      The star, the string, the crest?
    Vain froward child of Empire! say,
    Are all thy playthings snatched away?

                    XIX.

    Where may the wearied eye repose
      When gazing on the Great;
    Where neither guilty glory glows,
      Nor despicable state?
    Yes--One--the first--the last--the best--
    The Cincinnatus of the West,
      Whom Envy dared not hate,
    Bequeathed the name of Washington,
    To make man blush there was but one!

                                LARA.

                   CANTO THE FIRST.

                    I.

    The Serfs are glad through Lara's wide domain,
    And Slavery half forgets her feudal chain;
    He, their unhoped, but unforgotten lord,
    The long self-exiled Chieftain, is restored:
    There be bright faces in the busy hall,
    Bowls on the board, and banners on the wall;
    Far checkering o'er the pictured window, plays
    The unwonted faggot's hospitable blaze;
    And gay retainers gather round the hearth,
    With tongues all loudness, and with eyes all mirth.

                    II.

    The Chief of Lara is returned again:
    And why had Lara crossed the bounding main?
    Left by his Sire, too young such loss to know,
    Lord of himself,--that heritage of woe,
    That fearful empire which the human breast
    But holds to rob the heart within of rest!--
    With none to check, and few to point in time
    The thousand paths that slope the way to crime;
    Then, when he most required commandment, then
    Had Lara's daring boyhood governed men.
    It skills not, boots not step by step to trace
    His youth through all the mazes of its race;
    Short was the course his restlessness had run,
    But long enough to leave him half undone.

                    III.

    And Lara left in youth his father-land;
    But from the hour he waved his parting hand
    Each trace waxed fainter of his course, till all
    Had nearly ceased his memory to recall.
    His sire was dust, his vassals could declare,
    'Twas all they knew, that Lara was not there;
    Nor sent, nor came he, till conjecture grew
    Cold in the many, anxious in the few.
    His hall scarce echoes with his wonted name,
    His portrait darkens in its fading frame,
    Another chief consoled his destined bride,
    The young forgot him, and the old had died;
    "Yet doth he live!" exclaims the impatient heir,
    And sighs for sables which he must not wear.
    A hundred scutcheons deck with gloomy grace
    The Laras' last and longest dwelling-place;
    But one is absent from the mouldering file,
    That now were welcome in that Gothic pile.

                    IV.

    He comes at last in sudden loneliness,
    And whence they know not, why they need not guess;
    They more might marvel, when the greeting's o'er
    Not that he came, but came not long before:
    No train is his beyond a single page,
    Of foreign aspect, and of tender age.
    Years had rolled on, and fast they speed away
    To those that wander as to those that stay;
    But lack of tidings from another clime
    Had lent a flagging wing to weary Time.
    They see, they recognise, yet almost deem
    The present dubious, or the past a dream.

    He lives, nor yet is past his Manhood's prime,
    Though seared by toil, and something touched by Time;
    His faults, whate'er they were, if scarce forgot,
    Might be untaught him by his varied lot;
    Nor good nor ill of late were known, his name
    Might yet uphold his patrimonial fame:
    His soul in youth was haughty, but his sins
    No more than pleasure from the stripling wins;
    And such, if not yet hardened in their course,
    Might be redeemed, nor ask a long remorse.

                    V.

    And they indeed were changed--'tis quickly seen,
    Whate'er he be, 'twas not what he had been:
    That brow in furrowed lines had fixed at last,
    And spake of passions, but of passion past:
    The pride, but not the fire, of early days,
    Coldness of mien, and carelessness of praise;
    A high demeanour, and a glance that took
    Their thoughts from others by a single look;
    And that sarcastic levity of tongue,
    The stinging of a heart the world hath stung,
    That darts in seeming playfulness around,
    And makes those feel that will not own the wound;
    All these seemed his, and something more beneath
    Than glance could well reveal, or accent breathe.
    Ambition, Glory, Love, the common aim,
    That some can conquer, and that all would claim,
    Within his breast appeared no more to strive,
    Yet seemed as lately they had been alive;
    And some deep feeling it were vain to trace
    At moments lightened o'er his livid face.

                    VI.

    Not much he loved long question of the past,
    Nor told of wondrous wilds, and deserts vast,
    In those far lands where he had wandered lone,
    And--as himself would have it seem--unknown:
    Yet these in vain his eye could scarcely scan,
    Nor glean experience from his fellow man;
    But what he had beheld he shunned to show,
    As hardly worth a stranger's care to know;
    If still more prying such inquiry grew,
    His brow fell darker, and his words more few.

                    VII.

    Not unrejoiced to see him once again,
    Warm was his welcome to the haunts of men;
    Born of high lineage, linked in high command,
    He mingled with the Magnates of his land;
    Joined the carousals of the great and gay,
    And saw them smile or sigh their hours away;
    But still he only saw, and did not share,
    The common pleasure or the general care;
    He did not follow what they all pursued
    With hope still baffled still to be renewed;
    Nor shadowy Honour, nor substantial Gain,
    Nor Beauty's preference, and the rival's pain:
    Around him some mysterious circle thrown
    Repelled approach, and showed him still alone;
    Upon his eye sat something of reproof,
    That kept at least Frivolity aloof;
    And things more timid that beheld him near
    In silence gazed, or whispered mutual fear;
    And they the wiser, friendlier few confessed
    They deemed him better than his air expressed.

                    VIII.

    Twas strange--in youth all action and all life,
    Burning for pleasure, not averse from strife;
    Woman--the Field--the Ocean, all that gave
    Promise of gladness, peril of a grave,
    In turn he tried--he ransacked all below,
    And found his recompense in joy or woe,
    No tame, trite medium; for his feelings sought
    In that intenseness an escape from thought:
    The Tempest of his Heart in scorn had gazed
    On that the feebler Elements hath raised;
    The Rapture of his Heart had looked on high,
    And asked if greater dwelt beyond the sky:
    Chained to excess, the slave of each extreme,
    How woke he from the wildness of that dream!
    Alas! he told not--but he did awake
    To curse the withered heart that would not break.

                    IX.

    Books, for his volume heretofore was Man,
    With eye more curious he appeared to scan,
    And oft in sudden mood, for many a day,
    From all communion he would start away:
    And then, his rarely called attendants said,
    Through night's long hours would sound his hurried tread
    O'er the dark gallery, where his fathers frowned
    In rude but antique portraiture around:
    They heard, but whispered--"that must not be known--
    The sound of words less earthly than his own.
    Yes, they who chose might smile, but some had seen
    They scarce knew what, but more than should have been.
    Why gazed he so upon the ghastly head
    Which hands profane had gathered from the dead,
    That still beside his opened volume lay,
    As if to startle all save him away?
    Why slept he not when others were at rest?
    Why heard no music, and received no guest?
    All was not well, they deemed--but where the wrong?
    Some knew perchance--but 'twere a tale too long;
    And such besides were too discreetly wise,
    To more than hint their knowledge in surmise;
    But if they would--they could"--around the board
    Thus Lara's vassals prattled of their lord.

                    X.

    It was the night--and Lara's glassy stream
    The stars are studding, each with imaged beam;
    So calm, the waters scarcely seem to stray,
    And yet they glide like Happiness away;
    Reflecting far and fairy-like from high
    The immortal lights that live along the sky:
    Its banks are fringed with many a goodly tree,
    And flowers the fairest that may feast the bee;
    Such in her chaplet infant Dian wove,
    And Innocence would offer to her love.
    These deck the shore; the waves their channel make
    In windings bright and mazy like the snake.
    All was so still, so soft in earth and air,
    You scarce would start to meet a spirit there;
    Secure that nought of evil could delight
    To walk in such a scene, on such a night!
    It was a moment only for the good:
    So Lara deemed, nor longer there he stood,
    But turned in silence to his castle-gate;
    Such scene his soul no more could contemplate:
    Such scene reminded him of other days,
    Of skies more cloudless, moons of purer blaze,
    Of nights more soft and frequent, hearts that now--
    No--no--the storm may beat upon his brow,
    Unfelt, unsparing--but a night like this,
    A night of Beauty, mocked such breast as his.

                     XI.

    He turned within his solitary hall,
    And his high shadow shot along the wall:
    There were the painted forms of other times,
    'Twas all they left of virtues or of crimes,
    Save vague tradition; and the gloomy vaults
    That hid their dust, their foibles, and their faults;
    And half a column of the pompous page,
    That speeds the specious tale from age to age;
    Where History's pen its praise or blame supplies,
    And lies like Truth, and still most truly lies.
    He wandering mused, and as the moonbeam shone
    Through the dim lattice, o'er the floor of stone,
    And the high fretted roof, and saints, that there
    O'er Gothic windows knelt in pictured prayer,
    Reflected in fantastic figures grew,
    Like life, but not like mortal life, to view;
    His bristling locks of sable, brow of gloom,
    And the wide waving of his shaken plume,
    Glanced like a spectre's attributes--and gave
    His aspect all that terror gives the grave.

                    XII.

    'Twas midnight--all was slumber; the lone light
    Dimmed in the lamp, as both to break the night.
    Hark! there be murmurs heard in Lara's hall--
    A sound--a voice--a shriek--a fearful call!
    A long, loud shriek--and silence--did they hear
    That frantic echo burst the sleeping ear?
    They heard and rose, and, tremulously brave,
    Rush where the sound invoked their aid to save;
    They come with half-lit tapers in their hands,
    And snatched in startled haste unbelted brands.

                    XIII.

    Cold as the marble where his length was laid,
    Pale as the beam that o'er his features played,
    Was Lara stretched; his half-drawn sabre near,
    Dropped it should seem in more than Nature's fear;
    Yet he was firm, or had been firm till now,
    And still Defiance knit his gathered brow;
    Though mixed with terror, senseless as he lay,
    There lived upon his lip the wish to slay;
    Some half formed threat in utterance there had died,
    Some imprecation of despairing Pride;
    His eye was almost sealed, but not forsook,
    Even in its trance, the gladiator's look,
    That oft awake his aspect could disclose,
    And now was fixed in horrible repose.
    They raise him--bear him;--hush! he breathes, he speaks,
    The swarthy blush recolours in his cheeks,
    His lip resumes its red, his eye, though dim,
    Rolls wide and wild, each slowly quivering limb
    Recalls its function, but his words are strung
    In terms that seem not of his native tongue;
    Distinct but strange, enough they understand
    To deem them accents of another land;
    And such they were, and meant to meet an ear
    That hears him not--alas! that cannot hear!

                    XIV.

    His page approached, and he alone appeared
    To know the import of the words they heard;
    And, by the changes of his cheek and brow,
    They were not such as Lara should avow,
    Nor he interpret,--yet with less surprise
    Than those around their Chieftain's state he eyes,
    But Lara's prostrate form he bent beside,
    And in that tongue which seemed his own replied;
    And Lara heeds those tones that gently seem
    To soothe away the horrors of his dream--
    If dream it were, that thus could overthrow
    A breast that needed not ideal woe.

                    XV.

    Whate'er his frenzy dreamed or eye beheld,--
    If yet remembered ne'er to be revealed,--
    Rests at his heart: the customed morning came,
    And breathed new vigour in his shaken frame;
    And solace sought he none from priest nor leech,
    And soon the same in movement and in speech,
    As heretofore he filled the passing hours,
    Nor less he smiles, nor more his forehead lowers,
    Than these were wont; and if the coming night
    Appeared less welcome now to Lara's sight,
    He to his marvelling vassals showed it not,
    Whose shuddering proved their fear was less forgot.
    In trembling pairs (alone they dared not) crawl
    The astonished slaves, and shun the fated hall;
    The waving banner, and the clapping door,
    The rustling tapestry, and the echoing floor;
    The long dim shadows of surrounding trees,
    The flapping bat, the night song of the breeze;
    Aught they behold or hear their thought appals,
    As evening saddens o'er the dark grey walls.

                    XVI.

    Vain thought! that hour of ne'er unravelled gloom
    Came not again, or Lara could assume
    A seeming of forgetfulness, that made
    His vassals more amazed nor less afraid.
    Had Memory vanished then with sense restored?
    Since word, nor look, nor gesture of their lord
    Betrayed a feeling that recalled to these
    That fevered moment of his mind's disease.
    Was it a dream? was his the voice that spoke
    Those strange wild accents; his the cry that broke
    Their slumber? his the oppressed, o'erlaboured heart
    That ceased to beat, the look that made them start?
    Could he who thus had suffered so forget,
    When such as saw that suffering shudder yet?
    Or did that silence prove his memory fixed
    Too deep for words, indelible, unmixed
    In that corroding secrecy which gnaws
    The heart to show the effect, but not the cause?
    Not so in him; his breast had buried both,
    Nor common gazers could discern the growth
    Of thoughts that mortal lips must leave half told;
    They choke the feeble words that would unfold.

                    XVII.

    In him inexplicably mixed appeared
    Much to be loved and hated, sought and feared;
    Opinion varying o'er his hidden lot,
    In praise or railing ne'er his name forgot:
    His silence formed a theme for others' prate--
    They guessed--they gazed--they fain would know his fate.
    What had he been? what was he, thus unknown,
    Who walked their world, his lineage only known?
    A hater of his kind? yet some would say,
    With them he could seem gay amidst the gay;
    But owned that smile, if oft observed and near,
    Waned in its mirth, and withered to a sneer;
    That smile might reach his lip, but passed not by,
    Nor e'er could trace its laughter to his eye:
    Yet there was softness too in his regard,
    At times, a heart as not by nature hard,
    But once perceived, his Spirit seemed to chide
    Such weakness, as unworthy of its pride,
    And steeled itself, as scorning to redeem
    One doubt from others' half withheld esteem;
    In self-inflicted penance of a breast
    Which Tenderness might once have wrung from Rest;
    In vigilance of Grief that would compel
    The soul to hate for having loved too well.

                    XVIII.

    There was in him a vital scorn of all:
    As if the worst had fallen which could befall,
    He stood a stranger in this breathing world,
    An erring Spirit from another hurled;
    A thing of dark imaginings, that shaped
    By choice the perils he by chance escaped;
    But 'scaped in vain, for in their memory yet
    His mind would half exult and half regret:
    With more capacity for love than Earth
    Bestows on most of mortal mould and birth.
    His early dreams of good outstripped the truth,
    And troubled Manhood followed baffled Youth;
    With thought of years in phantom chase misspent,
    And wasted powers for better purpose lent;
    And fiery passions that had poured their wrath
    In hurried desolation o'er his path,
    And left the better feelings all at strife
    In wild reflection o'er his stormy life;
    But haughty still, and loth himself to blame,
    He called on Nature's self to share the shame,
    And charged all faults upon the fleshly form
    She gave to clog the soul, and feast the worm:
    Till he at last confounded good and ill,
    And half mistook for fate the acts of will:
    Too high for common selfishness, he could
    At times resign his own for others' good,
    But not in pity--not because he ought,
    But in some strange perversity of thought,
    That swayed him onward with a secret pride
    To do what few or none would do beside;
    And this same impulse would, in tempting time,
    Mislead his spirit equally to crime;
    So much he soared beyond, or sunk beneath,
    The men with whom he felt condemned to breathe,
    And longed by good or ill to separate
    Himself from all who shared his mortal state;
    His mind abhorring this had fixed her throne
    Far from the world, in regions of her own:
    Thus coldly passing all that passed below,
    His blood in temperate seeming now would flow:
    Ah! happier if it ne'er with guilt had glowed,
    But ever in that icy smoothness flowed!
    'Tis true, with other men their path he walked,
    And like the rest in seeming did and talked,
    Nor outraged Reason's rules by flaw nor start,
    His Madness was not of the head, but heart;
    And rarely wandered in his speech, or drew
    His thoughts so forth as to offend the view.

                    XIX.

    With all that chilling mystery of mien,
    And seeming gladness to remain unseen,
    He had (if 'twere not nature's boon) an art
    Of fixing memory on another's heart:
    It was not love perchance--nor hate--nor aught
    That words can image to express the thought;
    But they who saw him did not see in vain,
    And once beheld--would ask of him again:
    And those to whom he spake remembered well,
    And on the words, however light, would dwell:
    None knew, nor how, nor why, but he entwined
    Himself perforce around the hearer's mind;
    There he was stamped, in liking, or in hate,
    If greeted once; however brief the date
    That friendship, pity, or aversion knew,
    Still there within the inmost thought he grew.
    You could not penetrate his soul, but found,
    Despite your wonder, to your own he wound;
    His presence haunted still; and from the breast
    He forced an all unwilling interest:
    Vain was the struggle in that mental net--
    His Spirit seemed to dare you to forget!

                    XX.

    There is a festival, where knights and dames,
    And aught that wealth or lofty lineage claims,
    Appear--a high-born and a welcome guest
    To Otho's hall came Lara with the rest.
    The long carousal shakes the illumined hall,
    Well speeds alike the banquet and the ball;
    And the gay dance of bounding Beauty's train
    Links grace and harmony in happiest chain:
    Blest are the early hearts and gentle hands
    That mingle there in well according bands;
    It is a sight the careful brow might smooth,
    And make Age smile, and dream itself to youth,
    And Youth forget such hour was past on earth,
    So springs the exulting bosom to that mirth!

                    XXI.

    And Lara gazed on these, sedately glad,
    His brow belied him if his soul was sad;
    And his glance followed fast each fluttering fair,
    Whose steps of lightness woke no echo there:
    He leaned against the lofty pillar nigh,
    With folded arms and long attentive eye,
    Nor marked a glance so sternly fixed on his--
    Ill brooked high Lara scrutiny like this:
    At length he caught it--'tis a face unknown,
    But seems as searching his, and his alone;
    Prying and dark, a stranger's by his mien,
    Who still till now had gazed on him unseen:
    At length encountering meets the mutual gaze
    Of keen enquiry, and of mute amaze;
    On Lara's glance emotion gathering grew,
    As if distrusting that the stranger threw;
    Along the stranger's aspect, fixed and stern,
    Flashed more than thence the vulgar eye could learn.

                    XXII.

    "'Tis he!" the stranger cried, and those that heard
    Re-echoed fast and far the whispered word.
    "'Tis he!"--"'Tis who?" they question far and near,
    Till louder accents rung on Lara's ear;
    So widely spread, few bosoms well could brook
    The general marvel, or that single look:
    But Lara stirred not, changed not, the surprise
    That sprung at first to his arrested eyes
    Seemed now subsided--neither sunk nor raised
    Glanced his eye round, though still the stranger gazed;
    And drawing nigh, exclaimed, with haughty sneer,
    "'Tis he!--how came he thence?--what doth he here?"

                    XXIII.

    It were too much for Lara to pass by
    Such questions, so repeated fierce and high;
    With look collected, but with accent cold,
    More mildly firm than petulantly bold,
    He turned, and met the inquisitorial tone--
    "My name is Lara--when thine own is known,
    Doubt not my fitting answer to requite
    The unlooked for courtesy of such a knight.
    'Tis Lara!--further wouldst thou mark or ask?
    I shun no question, and I wear no mask."

      "Thou shunn'st no question! Ponder--is there none
    Thy heart must answer, though thine ear would shun?
    And deem'st thou me unknown too? Gaze again!
    At least thy memory was not given in vain.
    Oh! never canst thou cancel half her debt--
    Eternity forbids thee to forget."
    With slow and searching glance upon his face
    Grew Lara's eyes, but nothing there could trace
    They knew, or chose to know--with dubious look
    He deigned no answer, but his head he shook,
    And half contemptuous turned to pass away;
    But the stern stranger motioned him to stay.

      "A word!--I charge thee stay, and answer here
    To one, who, wert thou noble, were thy peer,
    But as thou wast and art--nay, frown not, Lord,
    If false, 'tis easy to disprove the word--
    But as thou wast and art, on thee looks down,
    Distrusts thy smiles, but shakes not at thy frown.
    Art thou not he? whose deeds----"
                                   "Whate'er I be,
    Words wild as these, accusers like to thee,
    I list no further; those with whom they weigh
    May hear the rest, nor venture to gainsay
    The wondrous tale no doubt thy tongue can tell,
    Which thus begins so courteously and well.
    Let Otho cherish here his polished guest,
    To him my thanks and thoughts shall be expressed."
    And here their wondering host hath interposed--
      "Whate'er there be between you undisclosed,
    This is no time nor fitting place to mar
    The mirthful meeting with a wordy war.
    If thou, Sir Ezzelin, hast aught to show
    Which it befits Count Lara's ear to know,
    To-morrow, here, or elsewhere, as may best
    Beseem your mutual judgment, speak the rest;
    I pledge myself for thee, as not unknown,
    Though, like Count Lara, now returned alone
    From other lands, almost a stranger grown;
    And if from Lara's blood and gentle birth
    I augur right of courage and of worth,
    He will not that untainted line belie,
    Nor aught that Knighthood may accord, deny."

      "To-morrow be it," Ezzelin replied,
    "And here our several worth and truth be tried;
    I gage my life, my falchion to attest
    My words, so may I mingle with the blest!"
    What answers Lara? to its centre shrunk
    His soul, in deep abstraction sudden sunk;
    The words of many, and the eyes of all
    That there were gathered, seemed on him to fall;
    But his were silent, his appeared to stray
    In far forgetfulness away--away--
    Alas! that heedlessness of all around
    Bespoke remembrance only too profound.

                    XXIV.

    "To-morrow!--aye, to-morrow!" further word
    Than those repeated none from Lara heard;
    Upon his brow no outward passion spoke;
    From his large eye no flashing anger broke;
    Yet there was something fixed in that low tone,
    Which showed resolve, determined, though unknown.
    He seized his cloak--his head he slightly bowed,
    And passing Ezzelin, he left the crowd;
    And, as he passed him, smiling met the frown
    With which that Chieftain's brow would bear him down:
    It was nor smile of mirth, nor struggling pride
    That curbs to scorn the wrath it cannot hide;
    But that of one in his own heart secure
    Of all that he would do, or could endure.
    Could this mean peace? the calmness of the good?
    Or guilt grown old in desperate hardihood?
    Alas! too like in confidence are each,
    For man to trust to mortal look or speech;
    From deeds, and deeds alone, may he discern
    Truths which it wrings the unpractised heart to learn.

                    XXV.

    And Lara called his page, and went his way--
    Well could that stripling word or sign obey:
    His only follower from those climes afar,
    Where the Soul glows beneath a brighter star:
    For Lara left the shore from whence he sprung,
    In duty patient, and sedate though young;
    Silent as him he served, his faith appears
    Above his station, and beyond his years.
    Though not unknown the tongue of Lara's land,
    In such from him he rarely heard command;
    But fleet his step, and clear his tones would come,
    When Lara's lip breathed forth the words of home:
    Those accents, as his native mountains dear,
    Awake their absent echoes in his ear,
    Friends'--kindred's--parents'--wonted voice recall,
    Now lost, abjured, for one--his friend, his all:
    For him earth now disclosed no other guide;
    What marvel then he rarely left his side?

                    XXVI.

    Light was his form, and darkly delicate
    That brow whereon his native sun had sate,
    But had not marred, though in his beams he grew,
    The cheek where oft the unbidden blush shone through;
    Yet not such blush as mounts when health would show
    All the heart's hue in that delighted glow;
    But 'twas a hectic tint of secret care
    That for a burning moment fevered there;
    And the wild sparkle of his eye seemed caught
    From high, and lightened with electric thought,
    Though its black orb those long low lashes' fringe
    Had tempered with a melancholy tinge;
    Yet less of sorrow than of pride was there,
    Or, if 'twere grief, a grief that none should share:
    And pleased not him the sports that please his age,
    The tricks of Youth, the frolics of the Page;
    For hours on Lara he would fix his glance,
    As all-forgotten in that watchful trance;
    And from his chief withdrawn, he wandered lone,
    Brief were his answers, and his questions none;
    His walk the wood, his sport some foreign book;
    His resting-place the bank that curbs the brook:
    He seemed, like him he served, to live apart
    From all that lures the eye, and fills the heart;
    To know no brotherhood, and take from earth
    No gift beyond that bitter boon--our birth.

                    XXVII.

    If aught he loved, 'twas Lara; but was shown
    His faith in reverence and in deeds alone;
    In mute attention; and his care, which guessed
    Each wish, fulfilled it ere the tongue expressed.
    Still there was haughtiness in all he did,
    A spirit deep that brooked not to be chid;
    His zeal, though more than that of servile hands,
    In act alone obeys, his air commands;
    As if 'twas Lara's less than his desire
    That thus he served, but surely not for hire.
    Slight were the tasks enjoined him by his Lord,
    To hold the stirrup, or to bear the sword;
    To tune his lute, or, if he willed it more,
    On tomes of other times and tongues to pore;
    But ne'er to mingle with the menial train,
    To whom he showed nor deference nor disdain,
    But that well-worn reserve which proved he knew
    No sympathy with that familiar crew:
    His soul, whate'er his station or his stem,
    Could bow to Lara, not descend to them.
    Of higher birth he seemed, and better days,
    Nor mark of vulgar toil that hand betrays,
    So femininely white it might bespeak
    Another sex, when matched with that smooth cheek,
    But for his garb, and something in his gaze,
    More wild and high than Woman's eye betrays;
    A latent fierceness that far more became
    His fiery climate than his tender frame:
    True, in his words it broke not from his breast,
    But from his aspect might be more than guessed.
    Kaled his name, though rumour said he bore
    Another ere he left his mountain-shore;
    For sometimes he would hear, however nigh,
    That name repeated loud without reply,
    As unfamiliar--or, if roused again,
    Start to the sound, as but remembered then;
    Unless 'twas Lara's wonted voice that spake,
    For then--ear--eyes--and heart would all awake.

                    XXVIII.

    He had looked down upon the festive hall,
    And mark'd that sudden strife so marked of all:
    And when the crowd around and near him told
    Their wonder at the calmness of the bold,
    Their marvel how the high-born Lara bore
    Such insult from a stranger, doubly sore,
    The colour of young Kaled went and came,
    The lip of ashes, and the cheek of flame;
    And o'er his brow the dampening heart-drops threw
    The sickening iciness of that cold dew,
    That rises as the busy bosom sinks
    With heavy thoughts from which Reflection shrinks.
    Yes--there be things which we must dream and dare,
    And execute ere thought be half aware:
    Whate'er might Kaled's be, it was enow
    To seal his lip, but agonise his brow.
    He gazed on Ezzelin till Lara cast
    That sidelong smile upon the knight he past;
    When Kaled saw that smile his visage fell,
    As if on something recognised right well:
    His memory read in such a meaning more
    Than Lara's aspect unto others wore:
    Forward he sprung--a moment, both were gone,
    And all within that hall seemed left alone;
    Each had so fixed his eye on Lara's mien,
    All had so mixed their feelings with that scene,
    That when his long dark shadow through the porch
    No more relieves the glare of yon high torch,
    Each pulse beats quicker, and all bosoms seem
    To bound as doubting from too black a dream,
    Such as we know is false, yet dread in sooth,
    Because the worst is ever nearest truth.
    And they are gone--but Ezzelin is there,
    With thoughtful visage and imperious air;
    But long remained not; ere an hour expired
    He waved his hand to Otho, and retired.

                    XXIX.

    The crowd are gone, the revellers at rest;
    The courteous host, and all-approving guest,
    Again to that accustomed couch must creep
    Where Joy subsides, and Sorrow sighs to sleep,
    And Man, o'erlaboured with his Being's strife,
    Shrinks to that sweet forgetfulness of life:
    There lie Love's feverish hope, and Cunning's guile,
    Hate's working brain, and lulled Ambition's wile;
    O'er each vain eye Oblivion's pinions wave,
    And quenched Existence crouches in a grave.
    What better name may Slumber's bed become?
    Night's sepulchre, the universal home,
    Where Weakness--Strength--Vice--Virtue--sunk supine,
    Alike in naked helplessness recline;
    Glad for a while to heave unconscious breath,
    Yet wake to wrestle with the dread of Death,
    And shun--though Day but dawn on ills increased--
    That sleep,--the loveliest, since it dreams the least.

                     CANTO THE SECOND.

                    I.

    Night wanes--the vapours round the mountains curled
    Melt into morn, and Light awakes the world,
    Man has another day to swell the past,
    And lead him near to little, but his last;
    But mighty Nature bounds as from her birth,
    The Sun is in the heavens, and Life on earth;
    Flowers in the valley, splendour in the beam,
    Health on the gale, and freshness in the stream.
    Immortal Man! behold her glories shine,
    And cry, exulting inly, "They are thine!"
    Gaze on, while yet thy gladdened eye may see:
    A morrow comes when they are not for thee:
    And grieve what may above thy senseless bier,
    Nor earth nor sky will yield a single tear;
    Nor cloud shall gather more, nor leaf shall fall,
    Nor gale breathe forth one sigh for thee, for all;
    But creeping things shall revel in their spoil,
    And fit thy clay to fertilise the soil.

                    II.

    'Tis morn--'tis noon--assembled in the hall,
    The gathered Chieftains come to Otho's call;
    'Tis now the promised hour, that must proclaim
    The life or death of Lara's future fame;
    And Ezzelin his charge may here unfold,
    And whatsoe'er the tale, it must be told.
    His faith was pledged, and Lara's promise given,
    To meet it in the eye of Man and Heaven.
    Why comes he not? Such truths to be divulged,
    Methinks the accuser's rest is long indulged.

                    III.

    The hour is past, and Lara too is there,
    With self-confiding, coldly patient air;
    Why comes not Ezzelin? The hour is past,
    And murmurs rise, and Otho's brow's o'ercast.
    "I know my friend! his faith I cannot fear,
    If yet he be on earth, expect him here;
    The roof that held him in the valley stands
    Between my own and noble Lara's lands;
    My halls from such a guest had honour gained,
    Nor had Sir Ezzelin his host disdained,
    But that some previous proof forbade his stay,
    And urged him to prepare against to-day;
    The word I pledged for his I pledge again,
    Or will myself redeem his knighthood's stain."
    He ceased--and Lara answered, "I am here
    To lend at thy demand a listening ear
    To tales of evil from a stranger's tongue,
    Whose words already might my heart have wrung,
    But that I deemed him scarcely less than mad,
    Or, at the worst, a foe ignobly bad.
    I know him not--but me it seems he knew
    In lands where--but I must not trifle too:
    Produce this babbler--or redeem the pledge;
    Here in thy hold, and with thy falchion's edge."

    Proud Otho on the instant, reddening, threw
    His glove on earth, and forth his sabre flew.
    "The last alternative befits me best,
    And thus I answer for mine absent guest."

    With cheek unchanging from its sallow gloom,
    However near his own or other's tomb;
    With hand, whose almost careless coolness spoke
    Its grasp well-used to deal the sabre-stroke;
    With eye, though calm, determined not to spare,
    Did Lara too his willing weapon bare.
    In vain the circling Chieftains round them closed,
    For Otho's frenzy would not be opposed;
    And from his lip those words of insult fell--
    His sword is good who can maintain them well.

                    IV.

    Short was the conflict; furious, blindly rash,
    Vain Otho gave his bosom to the gash:
    He bled, and fell; but not with deadly wound,
    Stretched by a dextrous sleight along the ground.
    "Demand thy life!" He answered not: and then
    From that red floor he ne'er had risen again,
    For Lara's brow upon the moment grew
    Almost to blackness in its demon hue;
    And fiercer shook his angry falchion now
    Than when his foe's was levelled at his brow;
    Then all was stern collectedness and art,
    Now rose the unleavened hatred of his heart;
    So little sparing to the foe he felled,
    That when the approaching crowd his arm withheld,
    He almost turned the thirsty point on those
    Who thus for mercy dared to interpose;
    But to a moment's thought that purpose bent;
    Yet looked he on him still with eye intent,
    As if he loathed the ineffectual strife
    That left a foe, howe'er o'erthrown, with life;
    As if to search how far the wound he gave
    Had sent its victim onward to his grave.

                    V.

    They raised the bleeding Otho, and the Leech
    Forbade all present question, sign, and speech;
    The others met within a neighbouring hall,
    And he, incensed, and heedless of them all,
    The cause and conqueror in this sudden fray,
    In haughty silence slowly strode away;
    He backed his steed, his homeward path he took,
    Nor cast on Otho's towers a single look.

                    VI.

    But where was he? that meteor of a night,
    Who menaced but to disappear with light.
    Where was this Ezzelin? who came and went,
    To leave no other trace of his intent.
    He left the dome of Otho long ere morn,
    In darkness, yet so well the path was worn
    He could not miss it: near his dwelling lay;
    But there he was not, and with coming day
    Came fast inquiry, which unfolded nought,
    Except the absence of the Chief it sought.
    A chamber tenantless, a steed at rest,
    His host alarmed, his murmuring squires distressed:
    Their search extends along, around the path,
    In dread to meet the marks of prowlers' wrath:
    But none are there, and not a brake hath borne
    Nor gout of blood, nor shred of mantle torn;
    Nor fall nor struggle hath defaced the grass,
    Which still retains a mark where Murder was;
    Nor dabbling fingers left to tell the tale,
    The bitter print of each convulsive nail,
    When agonised hands that cease to guard,
    Wound in that pang the smoothness of the sward.
    Some such had been, if here a life was reft,
    But these were not; and doubting Hope is left;
    And strange Suspicion, whispering Lara's name,
    Now daily mutters o'er his blackened fame;
    Then sudden silent when his form appeared,
    Awaits the absence of the thing it feared
    Again its wonted wondering to renew,
    And dye conjecture with a darker hue.

                    VII.

    Days roll along, and Otho's wounds are healed,
    But not his pride; and hate no more concealed:
    He was a man of power, and Lara's foe,
    The friend of all who sought to work him woe,
    And from his country's justice now demands
    Account of Ezzelin at Lara's hands.
    Who else than Lara could have cause to fear
    His presence? who had made him disappear,
    If not the man on whom his menaced charge
    Had sate too deeply were he left at large?
    The general rumour ignorantly loud,
    The mystery dearest to the curious crowd;
    The seeming friendliness of him who strove
    To win no confidence, and wake no love;
    The sweeping fierceness which his soul betrayed,
    The skill with which he wielded his keen blade;
    Where had his arm unwarlike caught that art?
    Where had that fierceness grown upon his heart?
    For it was not the blind capricious rage
    A word can kindle and a word assuage;
    But the deep working of a soul unmixed
    With aught of pity where its wrath had fixed;
    Such as long power and overgorged success
    Concentrates into all that's merciless:
    These, linked with that desire which ever sways
    Mankind, the rather to condemn than praise,
    'Gainst Lara gathering raised at length a storm,
    Such as himself might fear, and foes would form,
    And he must answer for the absent head
    Of one that haunts him still, alive or dead.

                    VIII.

    Within that land was many a malcontent,
    Who cursed the tyranny to which he bent;
    That soil full many a wringing despot saw,
    Who worked his wantonness in form of law;
    Long war without and frequent broil within
    Had made a path for blood and giant sin,
    That waited but a signal to begin
    New havoc, such as civil discord blends,
    Which knows no neuter, owns but foes or friends;
    Fixed in his feudal fortress each was lord,
    In word and deed obeyed, in soul abhorred.
    Thus Lara had inherited his lands,
    And with them pining hearts and sluggish hands;
    But that long absence from his native clime
    Had left him stainless of Oppression's crime,
    And now, diverted by his milder sway,
    All dread by slow degrees had worn away.
    The menials felt their usual awe alone,
    But more for him than them that fear was grown;
    They deemed him now unhappy, though at first
    Their evil judgment augured of the worst,
    And each long restless night, and silent mood,
    Was traced to sickness, fed by solitude:
    And though his lonely habits threw of late
    Gloom o'er his chamber, cheerful was his gate;
    For thence the wretched ne'er unsoothed withdrew,
    For them, at least, his soul compassion knew.
    Cold to the great, contemptuous to the high,
    The humble passed not his unheeding eye;
    Much he would speak not, but beneath his roof
    They found asylum oft, and ne'er reproof.
    And they who watched might mark that, day by day,
    Some new retainers gathered to his sway;
    But most of late, since Ezzelin was lost,
    He played the courteous lord and bounteous host:
    Perchance his strife with Otho made him dread
    Some snare prepared for his obnoxious head;
    Whate'er his view, his favour more obtains
    With these, the people, than his fellow thanes.
    If this were policy, so far 'twas sound,
    The million judged but of him as they found;
    From him by sterner chiefs to exile driven
    They but required a shelter, and 'twas given.
    By him no peasant mourned his rifled cot,
    And scarce the Serf could murmur o'er his lot;
    With him old Avarice found its hoard secure,
    With him contempt forbore to mock the poor;
    Youth present cheer and promised recompense
    Detained, till all too late to part from thence:
    To Hate he offered, with the coming change,
    The deep reversion of delayed revenge;
    To Love, long baffled by the unequal match,
    The well-won charms success was sure to snatch.
    All now was ripe, he waits but to proclaim
    That slavery nothing which was still a name.
    The moment came, the hour when Otho thought
    Secure at last the vengeance which he sought:
    His summons found the destined criminal
    Begirt by thousands in his swarming hall;
    Fresh from their feudal fetters newly riven,
    Defying earth, and confident of heaven.
    That morning he had freed the soil-bound slaves,
    Who dig no land for tyrants but their graves!
    Such is their cry--some watchword for the fight
    Must vindicate the wrong, and warp the right;
    Religion--Freedom--Vengeance--what you will,
    A word's enough to raise Mankind to kill;
    Some factious phrase by cunning caught and spread,
    That Guilt may reign-and wolves and worms be fed!

                    IX.

    Throughout that clime the feudal Chiefs had gained
    Such sway, their infant monarch hardly reigned;
    Now was the hour for Faction's rebel growth,
    The Serfs contemned the one, and hated both:
    They waited but a leader, and they found
    One to their cause inseparably bound;
    By circumstance compelled to plunge again,
    In self-defence, amidst the strife of men.
    Cut off by some mysterious fate from those
    Whom Birth and Nature meant not for his foes,
    Had Lara from that night, to him accurst,
    Prepared to meet, but not alone, the worst:
    Some reason urged, whate'er it was, to shun
    Inquiry into deeds at distance done;
    By mingling with his own the cause of all,
    E'en if he failed, he still delayed his fall.
    The sullen calm that long his bosom kept,
    The storm that once had spent itself and slept,
    Roused by events that seemed foredoomed to urge
    His gloomy fortunes to their utmost verge,
    Burst forth, and made him all he once had been,
    And is again; he only changed the scene.
    Light care had he for life, and less for fame,
    But not less fitted for the desperate game:
    He deemed himself marked out for others' hate,
    And mocked at Ruin so they shared his fate.
    And cared he for the freedom of the crowd?
    He raised the humble but to bend the proud.
    He had hoped quiet in his sullen lair,
    But Man and Destiny beset him there:
    Inured to hunters, he was found at bay;
    And they must kill, they cannot snare the prey.
    Stern, unambitious, silent, he had been
    Henceforth a calm spectator of Life's scene;
    But dragged again upon the arena, stood
    A leader not unequal to the feud;
    In voice--mien--gesture--savage nature spoke,
    And from his eye the gladiator broke.

                    X.

    What boots the oft-repeated tale of strife,
    The feast of vultures, and the waste of life?
    The varying fortune of each separate field,
    The fierce that vanquish, and the faint that yield?
    The smoking ruin, and the crumbled wall?
    In this the struggle was the same with all;
    Save that distempered passions lent their force
    In bitterness that banished all remorse.
    None sued, for Mercy knew her cry was vain,
    The captive died upon the battle-plain:
    In either cause, one rage alone possessed
    The empire of the alternate victor's breast;
    And they that smote for freedom or for sway,
    Deemed few were slain, while more remained to slay.
    It was too late to check the wasting brand,
    And Desolation reaped the famished land;
    The torch was lighted, and the flame was spread,
    And Carnage smiled upon her daily dead.

                    XI.

    Fresh with the nerve the new-born impulse strung,
    The first success to Lara's numbers clung:
    But that vain victory hath ruined all;
    They form no longer to their leader's call:
    In blind confusion on the foe they press,
    And think to snatch is to secure success.
    The lust of booty, and the thirst of hate,
    Lure on the broken brigands to their fate:
    In vain he doth whate'er a chief may do,
    To check the headlong fury of that crew;
    In vain their stubborn ardour he would tame,
    The hand that kindles cannot quench the flame;
    The wary foe alone hath turned their mood,
    And shown their rashness to that erring brood:
    The feigned retreat, the nightly ambuscade,
    The daily harass, and the fight delayed,
    The long privation of the hoped supply,
    The tentless rest beneath the humid sky,
    The stubborn wall that mocks the leaguer's art,
    And palls the patience of his baffled art,
    Of these they had not deemed: the battle-day
    They could encounter as a veteran may;
    But more preferred the fury of the strife,
    And present death, to hourly suffering life:
    And Famine wrings, and Fever sweeps away
    His numbers melting fast from their array;
    Intemperate triumph fades to discontent,
    And Lara's soul alone seems still unbent;
    But few remain to aid his voice and hand,
    And thousands dwindled to a scanty band:
    Desperate, though few, the last and best remained
    To mourn the discipline they late disdained.
    One hope survives, the frontier is not far,
    And thence they may escape from native war:
    And bear within them to the neighbouring state
    An exile's sorrows, or an outlaw's hate:
    Hard is the task their father-land to quit,
    But harder still to perish or submit.

                    XII.

    It is resolved--they march--consenting Night
    Guides with her star their dim and torchless flight;
    Already they perceive its tranquil beam
    Sleep on the surface of the barrier stream;
    Already they descry--Is yon the bank?
    Away! 'tis lined with many a hostile rank.
    Return or fly!--What glitters in the rear?
    'Tis Otho's banner--the pursuer's spear!
    Are those the shepherds' fires upon the height?
    Alas! they blaze too widely for the flight:
    Cut off from hope, and compassed in the toil,
    Less blood perchance hath bought a richer spoil!

                    XIII.

    A moment's pause--'tis but to breathe their band,
    Or shall they onward press, or here withstand?
    It matters little--if they charge the foes
    Who by their border-stream their march oppose,
    Some few, perchance, may break and pass the line,
    However linked to baffle such design.
    "The charge be ours! to wait for their assault
    Were fate well worthy of a coward's halt."
    Forth flies each sabre, reined is every steed,
    And the next word shall scarce outstrip the deed:
    In the next tone of Lara's gathering breath
    How many shall but hear the voice of Death!

                    XIV.

    His blade is bared,--in him there is an air
    As deep, but far too tranquil for despair;
    A something of indifference more than then
    Becomes the bravest, if they feel for men--
    He turned his eye on Kaled, ever near,
    And still too faithful to betray one fear;
    Perchance 'twas but the moon's dim twilight threw
    Along his aspect an unwonted hue
    Of mournful paleness, whose deep tint expressed
    The truth, and not the terror of his breast.
    This Lara marked, and laid his hand on his:
    It trembled not in such an hour as this;
    His lip was silent, scarcely beat his heart,
    His eye alone proclaimed, "We will not part!
    Thy band may perish, or thy friends may flee,
    Farewell to Life--but not Adieu to thee!"

    The word hath passed his lips, and onward driven,
    Pours the linked band through ranks asunder riven:
    Well has each steed obeyed the armed heel,
    And flash the scimitars, and rings the steel;
    Outnumbered, not outbraved, they still oppose
    Despair to daring, and a front to foes;
    And blood is mingled with the dashing stream,
    Which runs all redly till the morning beam.

                    XV.

    Commanding--aiding--animating all,
    Where foe appeared to press, or friend to fall,
    Cheers Lara's voice, and waves or strikes his steel,
    Inspiring hope, himself had ceased to feel.
    None fled, for well they knew that flight were vain;
    But those that waver turn to smite again,
    While yet they find the firmest of the foe
    Recoil before their leader's look and blow:
    Now girt with numbers, now almost alone,
    He foils their ranks, or re-unites his own;
    Himself he spared not--once they seemed to fly--
    Now was the time, he waved his hand on high,
    And shook--Why sudden droops that plumed crest?
    The shaft is sped--the arrow's in his breast!
    That fatal gesture left the unguarded side,
    And Death has stricken down yon arm of pride.
    The word of triumph fainted from his tongue;
    That hand, so raised, how droopingly it hung!
    But yet the sword instinctively retains,
    Though from its fellow shrink the falling reins;
    These Kaled snatches: dizzy with the blow,
    And senseless bending o'er his saddle-bow,
    Perceives not Lara that his anxious page
    Beguiles his charger from the combat's rage:
    Meantime his followers charge, and charge again;
    Too mixed the slayers now to heed the slain!

                    XVI.

    Day glimmers on the dying and the dead,
    The cloven cuirass, and the helmless head;
    The war-horse masterless is on the earth,
    And that last gasp hath burst his bloody girth;
    And near, yet quivering with what life remained,
    The heel that urged him and the hand that reined;
    And some too near that rolling torrent lie,
    Whose waters mock the lip of those that die;
    That panting thirst which scorches in the breath
    Of those that die the soldier's fiery death,
    In vain impels the burning mouth to crave
    One drop--the last--to cool it for the grave;
    With feeble and convulsive effort swept,
    Their limbs along the crimsoned turf have crept;
    The faint remains of life such struggles waste,
    But yet they reach the stream, and bend to taste:
    They feel its freshness, and almost partake--
    Why pause? No further thirst have they to slake--
    It is unquenched, and yet they feel it not;
    It was an agony--but now forgot!

                    XVII.

    Beneath a lime, remoter from the scene,
    Where but for him that strife had never been,
    A breathing but devoted warrior lay:
    'Twas Lara bleeding fast from life away.
    His follower once, and now his only guide,
    Kneels Kaled watchful o'er his welling side,
    And with his scarf would staunch the tides that rush,
    With each convulsion, in a blacker gush;
    And then, as his faint breathing waxes low,
    In feebler, not less fatal tricklings flow:
    He scarce can speak, but motions him 'tis vain,
    And merely adds another throb to pain.
    He clasps the hand that pang which would assuage,
    And sadly smiles his thanks to that dark page,
    Who nothing fears--nor feels--nor heeds--nor sees--
    Save that damp brow which rests upon his knees;
    Save that pale aspect, where the eye, though dim,
    Held all the light that shone on earth for him.

                    XVIII.

    The foe arrives, who long had searched the field,
    Their triumph nought till Lara too should yield:
    They would remove him, but they see 'twere vain,
    And he regards them with a calm disdain,
    That rose to reconcile him with his fate,
    And that escape to death from living hate:
    And Otho comes, and leaping from his steed,
    Looks on the bleeding foe that made him bleed,
    And questions of his state; he answers not,
    Scarce glances on him as on one forgot,
    And turns to Kaled:--each remaining word
    They understood not, if distinctly heard;
    His dying tones are in that other tongue,
    To which some strange remembrance wildly clung.
    They spake of other scenes, but what--is known
    To Kaled, whom their meaning reached alone;
    And he replied, though faintly, to their sound,
    While gazed the rest in dumb amazement round:
    They seemed even then--that twain--unto the last
    To half forget the present in the past;
    To share between themselves some separate fate,
    Whose darkness none beside should penetrate.

                    XIX.

    Their words though faint were many--from the tone
    Their import those who heard could judge alone;
    From this, you might have deemed young Kaled's death
    More near than Lara's by his voice and breath,
    So sad--so deep--and hesitating broke
    The accents his scarce-moving pale lips spoke;
    But Lara's voice, though low, at first was clear
    And calm, till murmuring Death gasped hoarsely near;
    But from his visage little could we guess,
    So unrepentant--dark--and passionless,
    Save that when struggling nearer to his last,
    Upon that page his eye was kindly cast;
    And once, as Kaled's answering accents ceased,
    Rose Lara's hand, and pointed to the East:
    Whether (as then the breaking Sun from high
    Rolled back the clouds) the morrow caught his eye,
    Or that 'twas chance--or some remembered scene,
    That raised his arm to point where such had been,
    Scarce Kaled seemed to know, but turned away,
    As if his heart abhorred that coming day,
    And shrunk his glance before that morning light,
    To look on Lara's brow--where all grew night.
    Yet sense seemed left, though better were its loss;
    For when one near displayed the absolving Cross,
    And proffered to his touch the holy bead,
    Of which his parting soul might own the need,
    He looked upon it with an eye profane,
    And smiled--Heaven pardon! if 'twere with disdain:
    And Kaled, though he spoke not, nor withdrew
    From Lara's face his fixed despairing view,
    With brow repulsive, and with gesture swift,
    Flung back the hand which held the sacred gift,
    As if such but disturbed the expiring man,
    Nor seemed to know his life but then began--
    That Life of Immortality, secure
    To none, save them whose faith in Christ is sure.

                    XX.

    But gasping heaved the breath that Lara drew,
    And dull the film along his dim eye grew;
    His limbs stretched fluttering, and his head drooped o'er
    The weak yet still untiring knee that bore;
    He pressed the hand he held upon his heart--
    It beats no more, but Kaled will not part
    With the cold grasp, but feels, and feels in vain,
    For that faint throb which answers not again.
    "It beats!"--Away, thou dreamer! he is gone--
    It once was Lara which thou look'st upon.

                    XXI.

    He gazed, as if not yet had passed away
    The haughty spirit of that humbled clay;
    And those around have roused him from his trance,
    But cannot tear from thence his fixed glance;
    And when, in raising him from where he bore
    Within his arms the form that felt no more,
    He saw the head his breast would still sustain,
    Roll down like earth to earth upon the plain;
    He did not dash himself thereby, nor tear
    The glossy tendrils of his raven hair,
    But strove to stand and gaze, but reeled and fell,
    Scarce breathing more than that he loved so well.
    Than that he loved! Oh! never yet beneath
    The breast of man such trusty love may breathe!
    That trying moment hath at once revealed
    The secret long and yet but half concealed;
    In baring to revive that lifeless breast,
    Its grief seemed ended, but the sex confessed;
    And life returned, and Kaled felt no shame--
    What now to her was Womanhood or Fame?

                    XXII.

    And Lara sleeps not where his fathers sleep,
    But where he died his grave was dug as deep;
    Nor is his mortal slumber less profound,
    Though priest nor blessed nor marble decked the mound,
    And he was mourned by one whose quiet grief,
    Less loud, outlasts a people's for their Chief.
    Vain was all question asked her of the past,
    And vain e'en menace--silent to the last;
    She told nor whence, nor why she left behind
    Her all for one who seemed but little kind.
    Why did she love him? Curious fool!--be still--
    Is human love the growth of human will?
    To her he might be gentleness; the stern
    Have deeper thoughts than your dull eyes discern,
    And when they love, your smilers guess not how
    Beats the strong heart, though less the lips avow.
    They were not common links, that formed the chain
    That bound to Lara Kaled's heart and brain;
    But that wild tale she brooked not to unfold,
    And sealed is now each lip that could have told.

                    XXIII.

    They laid him in the earth, and on his breast,
    Besides the wound that sent his soul to rest,
    They found the scattered dints of many a scar,
    Which were not planted there in recent war;
    Where'er had passed his summer years of life,
    It seems they vanished in a land of strife;
    But all unknown his Glory or his Guilt,
    These only told that somewhere blood was spilt,
    And Ezzelin, who might have spoke the past,
    Returned no more--that night appeared his last.

                    XXIV.

    Upon that night (a peasant's is the tale)
    A Serf that crossed the intervening vale,
    When Cynthia's light almost gave way to morn,
    And nearly veiled in mist her waning horn;
    A Serf, that rose betimes to thread the wood,
    And hew the bough that bought his children's food,
    Passed by the river that divides the plain
    Of Otho's lands and Lara's broad domain:
    He heard a tramp--a horse and horseman broke
    From out the wood--before him was a cloak
    Wrapt round some burthen at his saddle-bow,
    Bent was his head, and hidden was his brow.
    Roused by the sudden sight at such a time,
    And some foreboding that it might be crime,
    Himself unheeded watched the stranger's course,
    Who reached the river, bounded from his horse,
    And lifting thence the burthen which he bore,
    Heaved up the bank, and dashed it from the shore,
    Then paused--and looked--and turned--and seemed to watch,
    And still another hurried glance would snatch,
    And follow with his step the stream that flowed,
    As if even yet too much its surface showed;
    At once he started--stooped--around him strown
    The winter floods had scattered heaps of stone:
    Of these the heaviest thence he gathered there,
    And slung them with a more than common care.
    Meantime the Serf had crept to where unseen
    Himself might safely mark what this might mean;
    He caught a glimpse, as of a floating breast,
    And something glittered starlike on the vest;
    But ere he well could mark the buoyant trunk,
    A massy fragment smote it, and it sunk:
    It rose again, but indistinct to view,
    And left the waters of a purple hue,
    Then deeply disappeared: the horseman gazed
    Till ebbed the latest eddy it had raised;
    Then turning, vaulted on his pawing steed,
    And instant spurred him into panting speed.
    His face was masked--the features of the dead,
    If dead it were, escaped the observer's dread;
    But if in sooth a Star its bosom bore,
    Such is the badge that Knighthood ever wore,
    And such 'tis known Sir Ezzelin had worn
    Upon the night that led to such a morn.
    If thus he perished, Heaven receive his soul!
    His undiscovered limbs to ocean roll;
    And charity upon the hope would dwell
    It was not Lara's hand by which he fell.

                    XXV.

    And Kaled--Lara--Ezzelin, are gone,
    Alike without their monumental stone!
    The first, all efforts vainly strove to wean
    From lingering where her Chieftain's blood had been:
    Grief had so tamed a spirit once too proud,
    Her tears were few, her wailing never loud;
    But furious would you tear her from the spot
    Where yet she scarce believed that he was not,
    Her eye shot forth with all the living fire
    That haunts the tigress in her whelpless ire;
    But left to waste her weary moments there,
    She talked all idly unto shapes of air,
    Such as the busy brain of Sorrow paints,
    And woos to listen to her fond complaints:
    And she would sit beneath the very tree
    Where lay his drooping head upon her knee;
    And in that posture where she saw him fall,
    His words, his looks, his dying grasp recall;
    And she had shorn, but saved her raven hair,
    And oft would snatch it from her bosom there,
    And fold, and press it gently to the ground,
    As if she staunched anew some phantom's wound.
    Herself would question, and for him reply;
    Then rising, start, and beckon him to fly
    From some imagined Spectre in pursuit;
    Then seat her down upon some linden's root,
    And hide her visage with her meagre hand,
    Or trace strange characters along the sand--
    This could not last--she lies by him she loved;
    Her tale untold--her truth too dearly proved.

                             HEBREW MELODIES

                 SHE WALKS IN BEAUTY.

                    I.

    She walks in Beauty, like the night
      Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
    And all that's best of dark and bright
      Meet in her aspect and her eyes:
    Thus mellowed to that tender light
      Which Heaven to gaudy day denies.

                    II.

    One shade the more, one ray the less,
      Had half impaired the nameless grace
    Which waves in every raven tress,
      Or softly lightens o'er her face;
    Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
     How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

                    III.

    And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
      So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
    The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
      But tell of days in goodness spent,
    A mind at peace with all below,
      A heart whose love is innocent!
                                                       
            THE HARP THE MONARCH MINSTREL SWEPT.

                    I.

      The Harp the Monarch Minstrel swept,
        The King of men, the loved of Heaven!
      Which Music hallowed while she wept
        O'er tones her heart of hearts had given--
    Redoubled be her tears, its chords are riven!
      It softened men of iron mould,
        It gave them virtues not their own;
      No ear so dull, no soul so cold,
        That felt not--fired not to the tone,
    Till David's Lyre grew mightier than his Throne!

                    II.

      It told the triumphs of our King,
        It wafted glory to our God;
      It made our gladdened valleys ring,
        The cedars bow, the mountains nod;
    Its sound aspired to Heaven and there abode!
      Since then, though heard on earth no more,
        Devotion and her daughter Love
      Still bid the bursting spirit soar
        To sounds that seem as from above,
    In dreams that day's broad light can not remove.

                    IF THAT HIGH WORLD.

                    I.

    If that high world, which lies beyond
      Our own, surviving Love endears;
    If there the cherished heart be fond,
      The eye the same, except in tears--
    How welcome those untrodden spheres!
      How sweet this very hour to die!
    To soar from earth and find all fears
      Lost in thy light--Eternity!

                    II.

    It must be so: 'tis not for self
      That we so tremble on the brink;
    And striving to o'erleap the gulf,
      Yet cling to Being's severing link.
    Oh! in that future let us think
      To hold each heart the heart that shares,
    With them the immortal waters drink,
      And soul in soul grow deathless theirs!

                     THE WILD GAZELLE.

                    I.

    The wild gazelle on Judah's hills
      Exulting yet may bound,
    And drink from all the living rills
      That gush on holy ground;
    Its airy step and glorious eye
    May glance in tameless transport by:--

                    II.

    A step as fleet, an eye more bright,
      Hath Judah witnessed there;
    And o'er her scenes of lost delight
      Inhabitants more fair.
    The cedars wave on Lebanon,
    But Judah's statelier maids are gone!

                    III.

      Than Israel's scattered race;
    For, taking root, it there remains
      In solitary grace:
    It cannot quit its place of birth,
    It will not live in other earth.

                    IV.

    But we must wander witheringly,
      In other lands to die;
    And where our fathers' ashes be,
      Our own may never lie:
    Our temple hath not left a stone,
    And Mockery sits on Salem's throne.

                    OH! WEEP FOR THOSE.

                    I.

    Oh! weep for those that wept by Babel's stream,
    Whose shrines are desolate, whose land a dream;
    Weep for the harp of Judah's broken shell;
    Mourn--where their God hath dwelt the godless dwell!

                    II.

    And where shall Israel lave her bleeding feet?
    And when shall Zion's songs again seem sweet?
    And Judah's melody once more rejoice
    The hearts that leaped before its heavenly voice?

                    III.

    Tribes of the wandering foot and weary breast,
    How shall ye flee away and be at rest!
    The wild-dove hath her nest, the fox his cave,
    Mankind their country--Israel but the grave!

                     ON JORDAN'S BANKS.

                    I.

    On Jordan's banks the Arab's camels stray,
    On Sion's hill the False One's votaries pray,
    The Baal-adorer bows on Sinai's steep--
    Yet there--even there--Oh God! thy thunders sleep:

                    II.

    There--where thy finger scorched the tablet stone!
    There--where thy shadow to thy people shone!
    Thy glory shrouded in its garb of fire:
    Thyself--none living see and not expire!

                    III.

    Oh! in the lightning let thy glance appear;
    Sweep from his shivered hand the oppressor's spear!
    How long by tyrants shall thy land be trod?
    How long thy temple worshipless, Oh God?

                  JEPHTHA'S DAUGHTER.

                    I.

    Since our Country, our God--Oh, my Sire!
    Demand that thy Daughter expire;
    Since thy triumph was bought by thy vow--
    Strike the bosom that's bared for thee now!

                    II.

    And the voice of my mourning is o'er,
    And the mountains behold me no more:
    If the hand that I love lay me low,
    There cannot be pain in the blow!

                    III.

    And of this, oh, my Father! be sure--
    That the blood of thy child is as pure
    As the blessing I beg ere it flow,
    And the last thought that soothes me below.

                    IV.

    Though the virgins of Salem lament,
    Be the judge and the hero unbent!
    I have won the great battle for thee,
    And my Father and Country are free!

                    V.

    When this blood of thy giving hath gushed,
    When the voice that thou lovest is hushed,
    Let my memory still be thy pride,
    And forget not I smiled as I died!

         OH! SNATCHED AWAY IN BEAUTY'S BLOOM.

                    I.

      Oh! snatched away in beauty's bloom,
      On thee shall press no ponderous tomb;
        But on thy turf shall roses rear
        Their leaves, the earliest of the year;
    And the wild cypress wave in tender gloom:

                    II.

      And oft by yon blue gushing stream
        Shall Sorrow lean her drooping head,
      And feed deep thought with many a dream,
        And lingering pause and lightly tread;
    Fond wretch! as if her step disturbed the dead!

                    III.

    Away! we know that tears are vain,
      That Death nor heeds nor hears distress:
    Will this unteach us to complain?
      Or make one mourner weep the less?
    And thou--who tell'st me to forget,
    Thy looks are wan, thine eyes are wet.
     
                      MY SOUL IS DARK.

                    I.

    My soul is dark--Oh! quickly string
      The harp I yet can brook to hear;
    And let thy gentle fingers fling
      Its melting murmurs o'er mine ear.
    If in this heart a hope be dear,
      That sound shall charm it forth again:
    If in these eyes there lurk a tear,
      'Twill flow, and cease to burn my brain.

                    II.

    But bid the strain be wild and deep,
      Nor let thy notes of joy be first:
    I tell thee, minstrel, I must weep,
      Or else this heavy heart will burst;
    For it hath been by sorrow nursed,
      And ached in sleepless silence long;
    And now 'tis doomed to know the worst,
      And break at once--or yield to song.

                      I SAW THEE WEEP.

                    I.

    I saw thee weep--the big bright tear
      Came o'er that eye of blue;
    And then methought it did appear
      A violet dropping dew:
    I saw thee smile--the sapphire's blaze
      Beside thee ceased to shine;
    It could not match the living rays
      That filled that glance of thine.

                    II.

    As clouds from yonder sun receive
      A deep and mellow dye,
    Which scarce the shade of coming eve
      Can banish from the sky,
    Those smiles unto the moodiest mind
      Their own pure joy impart;
    Their sunshine leaves a glow behind
      That lightens o'er the heart.

                     THY DAYS ARE DONE.

                    I.

    Thy days are done, thy fame begun;
      Thy country's strains record
    The triumphs of her chosen Son,
      The slaughters of his sword!
    The deeds he did, the fields he won,
      The freedom he restored!

                    II.

    Though thou art fall'n, while we are free
      Thou shall not taste of death!
    The generous blood that flowed from thee
      Disdained to sink beneath:
    Within our veins its currents be,
      Thy spirit on our breath!

                    III.

    Thy name, our charging hosts along,
      Shall be the battle-word!
    Thy fall, the theme of choral song
      From virgin voices poured!
    To weep would do thy glory wrong:
      Thou shalt not be deplored.

                           SAUL.

                    I.

        Thou whose spell can raise the dead,
          Bid the Prophet's form appear.
        "Samuel, raise thy buried head!
          King, behold the phantom Seer!"
    Earth yawned; he stood the centre of a cloud:
    Light changed its hue, retiring from his shroud.
    Death stood all glassy in his fixed eye;
    His hand was withered, and his veins were dry;
    His foot, in bony whiteness, glittered there,
    Shrunken and sinewless, and ghastly bare;
    From lips that moved not and unbreathing frame,
    Like caverned winds, the hollow accents came.
    Saul saw, and fell to earth, as falls the oak,
    At once, and blasted by the thunder-stroke.

                    II.

          "Why is my sleep disquieted?
          Who is he that calls the dead?
          Is it thou, O King? Behold,
          Bloodless are these limbs, and cold:
          Such are mine; and such shall be
          Thine to-morrow, when with me:
          Ere the coming day is done,
          Such shalt thou be--such thy Son.
          Fare thee well, but for a day,
          Then we mix our mouldering clay.
          Thou--thy race, lie pale and low,
          Pierced by shafts of many a bow;
          And the falchion by thy side
          To thy heart thy hand shall guide:
          Crownless--breathless--headless fall,
          Son and Sire--the house of Saul!"
                                                   
            SONG OF SAUL BEFORE HIS LAST BATTLE.

                    I.

    Warriors and chiefs! should the shaft or the sword
    Pierce me in leading the host of the Lord,
    Heed not the corse, though a King's, in your path:
    Bury your steel in the bosoms of Gath!

                    II.

    Thou who art bearing my buckler and bow,
    Should the soldiers of Saul look away from the foe,
    Stretch me that moment in blood at thy feet!
    Mine be the doom which they dared not to meet.

                    III.

    Farewell to others, but never we part,
    Heir to my Royalty--Son of my heart!
    Bright is the diadem, boundless the sway,
    Or kingly the death, which awaits us to-day!
                                                             
             "ALL IS VANITY, SAITH THE PREACHER"

                    I.

        Fame, Wisdom, Love, and Power were mine,
          And Health and Youth possessed me;
        My goblets blushed from every vine,
          And lovely forms caressed me;
        I sunned my heart in Beauty's eyes,
          And felt my soul grow tender;
        All Earth can give, or mortal prize,
          Was mine of regal splendour.

                    II.

        I strive to number o'er what days
          Remembrance can discover,
        Which all that Life or Earth displays
          Would lure me to live over.
        There rose no day, there rolled no hour
          Of pleasure unembittered;
        And not a trapping decked my Power
          That galled not while it glittered.

                    III.

        The serpent of the field, by art
          And spells, is won from harming;
        But that which coils around the heart,
          Oh! who hath power of charming?
        It will not list to Wisdom's lore,
          Nor Music's voice can lure it;
        But there it stings for evermore
          The soul that must endure it.
                                                         
          WHEN COLDNESS WRAPS THIS SUFFERING CLAY.

                    I.

    When coldness wraps this suffering clay,
      Ah! whither strays the immortal mind?
    It cannot die, it cannot stay,
      But leaves its darkened dust behind.
    Then, unembodied, doth it trace
      By steps each planet's heavenly way?
    Or fill at once the realms of space,
      A thing of eyes, that all survey?

                    II.

    Eternal--boundless,--undecayed,
      A thought unseen, but seeing all,
    All, all in earth, or skies displayed,
      Shall it survey, shall it recall:
    Each fainter trace that Memory holds
      So darkly of departed years,
    In one broad glance the Soul beholds,
      And all, that was, at once appears.

                    III.

    Before Creation peopled earth,
      Its eye shall roll through chaos back;
    And where the farthest heaven had birth,
      The Spirit trace its rising track.
    And where the future mars or makes,
      Its glance dilate o'er all to be,
    While Sun is quenched--or System breaks,
      Fixed in its own Eternity.

                    IV.

    Above or Love--Hope--Hate--or Fear,
      It lives all passionless and pure:
    An age shall fleet like earthly year;
      Its years as moments shall endure.
    Away--away--without a wing,
      O'er all--through all--its thought shall fly,
    A nameless and eternal thing,
      Forgetting what it was to die.
                                                       
                 VISION OF BELSHAZZAR.

                    I.

    The King was on his throne,
      The Satraps thronged the hall:
    A thousand bright lamps shone
      O'er that high festival.
    A thousand cups of gold,
      In Judah deemed divine--
    Jehovah's vessels hold
      The godless Heathen's wine!

                    II.

    In that same hour and hall,
      The fingers of a hand
    Came forth against the wall,
      And wrote as if on sand:
    The fingers of a man;--
      A solitary hand
    Along the letters ran,
      And traced them like a wand.

                    III.

    The monarch saw, and shook,
      And bade no more rejoice;
    All bloodless waxed his look,
      And tremulous his voice.
    "Let the men of lore appear,
      The wisest of the earth,
    And expound the words of fear,
      Which mar our royal mirth."

                    IV.

    Chaldea's seers are good,
      But here they have no skill;
    And the unknown letters stood
      Untold and awful still.
    And Babel's men of age
      Are wise and deep in lore;
    But now they were not sage,
      They saw--but knew no more.

                    V.

    A captive in the land,
      A stranger and a youth,
    He heard the King's command,
      He saw that writing's truth.
    The lamps around were bright,
      The prophecy in view;
    He read it on that night,--
      The morrow proved it true.

                    VI.

    "Belshazzar's grave is made,
      His kingdom passed away.
    He, in the balance weighed,
      Is light and worthless clay;
    The shroud, his robe of state,
      His canopy the stone;
    The Mede is at his gate!
      The Persian on his throne!"

                   SUN OF THE SLEEPLESS!

    Sun of the sleepless! melancholy star!
    Whose tearful beam glows tremulously far,
    That show'st the darkness thou canst not dispel,
    How like art thou to Joy remembered well!
    So gleams the past, the light of other days,
    Which shines, but warms not with its powerless rays:
    A night-beam Sorrow watcheth to behold,
    Distinct, but distant--clear--but, oh how cold!

      WERE MY BOSOM AS FALSE AS THOU DEEM'ST IT TO BE.

                    I.

    Were my bosom as false as thou deem'st it to be,
    I need not have wandered from far Galilee;
    It was but abjuring my creed to efface
    The curse which, thou say'st, is the crime of my race.

                    II.

    If the bad never triumph, then God is with thee!
    If the slave only sin--thou art spotless and free!
    If the Exile on earth is an Outcast on high,
    Live on in thy faith--but in mine I will die.

                    III.

    I have lost for that faith more than thou canst bestow,
    As the God who permits thee to prosper doth know;
    In his hand is my heart and my hope--and in thine
    The land and the life which for him I resign.
                                                         
             HEROD'S LAMENT FOR MARIAMNE.

                    I.

    Oh, Mariamne! now for thee
      The heart for which thou bled'st is bleeding;
    Revenge is lost in Agony
      And wild Remorse to rage succeeding.
    Oh, Mariamne! where art thou?
      Thou canst not hear my bitter pleading:
    Ah! could'st thou--thou would'st pardon now,
      Though Heaven were to my prayer unheeding.

                    II.

    And is she dead?--and did they dare
      Obey my Frenzy's jealous raving?
    My Wrath but doomed my own despair:
      The sword that smote her 's o'er me waving.--
    But thou art cold, my murdered Love!
      And this dark heart is vainly craving
    For he who soars alone above,
      And leaves my soul unworthy saving.

                    III.

    She's gone, who shared my diadem;
      She sunk, with her my joys entombing;
    I swept that flower from Judah's stem,
      Whose leaves for me alone were blooming;
    And mine's the guilt, and mine the hell,
      This bosom's desolation dooming;
    And I have earned those tortures well,
      Which unconsumed are still consuming!
                                                      
    ON THE DAY OF THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM BY TITUS.

                    I.

    From the last hill that looks on thy once holy dome,
    I beheld thee, oh Sion! when rendered to Rome:
    'Twas thy last sun went down, and the flames of thy fall
    Flashed back on the last glance I gave to thy wall.

                    II.

    I looked for thy temple--I looked for my home,
    And forgot for a moment my bondage to come;
    I beheld but the death-fire that fed on thy fane,
    And the fast-fettered hands that made vengeance in vain.

                    III.

    On many an eve, the high spot whence I gazed
    Had reflected the last beam of day as it blazed;
    While I stood on the height, and beheld the decline
    Of the rays from the mountain that shone on thy shrine.

                    IV.

    And now on that mountain I stood on that day,
    But I marked not the twilight beam melting away;
    Oh! would that the lightning had glared in its stead,
    And the thunderbolt burst on the Conqueror's head!

                    V.

    But the Gods of the Pagan shall never profane
    The shrine where Jehovah disdained not to reign;
    And scattered and scorned as thy people may be,
    Our worship, oh Father! is only for thee.
                                                                   
    BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON WE SAT DOWN AND WEPT.

                    I.

    We sate down and wept by the waters
      Of Babel, and thought of the day
    When our foe, in the hue of his slaughters,
      Made Salem's high places his prey;
    And Ye, oh her desolate daughters!
      Were scattered all weeping away.

                    II.

    While sadly we gazed on the river
      Which rolled on in freedom below,
    They demanded the song; but, oh never
      That triumph the Stranger shall know!
    May this right hand be withered for ever,
      Ere it string our high harp for the foe!

                    III.

    On the willow that harp is suspended,
      Oh Salem! its sound should be free;
    And the hour when thy glories were ended
      But left me that token of thee:
    And ne'er shall its soft tones be blended
      With the voice of the Spoiler by me!
                                                    
                "BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON."

                    I.

    In the valley of waters we wept on the day
    When the host of the Stranger made Salem his prey;
    And our heads on our bosoms all droopingly lay,
    And our hearts were so full of the land far away!

                    II.

    The song they demanded in vain--it lay still
    In our souls as the wind that hath died on the hill--
    They called for the harp--but our blood they shall spill
    Ere our right hands shall teach them one tone of their skill.

                    III.

    All stringlessly hung in the willow's sad tree,
    As dead as her dead-leaf, those mute harps must be:
    Our hands may be fettered--our tears still are free
    For our God--and our Glory--and Sion, Oh Thee!
                                                                   
              THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB.

                    I.

    The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
    And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
    And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
    When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.

                    II.

    Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,
    That host with their banners at sunset were seen:
    Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown,
    That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.

                    III.

    For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,
    And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;
    And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,
    And their hearts but once heaved--and for ever grew still!

                    IV.

    And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,
    But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride;
    And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,
    And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.

                    V.

    And there lay the rider distorted and pale,
    With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail:
    And the tents were all silent--the banners alone--
    The lances unlifted--the trumpet unblown.

                    VI.

    And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,
    And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;
    And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,
    Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!
                                                   
                 A SPIRIT PASSED BEFORE ME.

                         FROM JOB.

                    I.

    A spirit passed before me: I beheld
    The face of Immortality unveiled--
    Deep Sleep came down on every eye save mine--
    And there it stood,--all formless--but divine:
    Along my bones the creeping flesh did quake;
    And as my damp hair stiffened, thus it spake:

                    II.

    "Is man more just than God? Is man more pure
    Than he who deems even Seraphs insecure?
    Creatures of clay--vain dwellers in the dust!
    The moth survives you, and are ye more just?
    Things of a day! you wither ere the night,
    Heedless and blind to Wisdom's wasted light!"

             FAREWELL! IF EVER FONDEST PRAYER.

                    1.

    Farewell! if ever fondest prayer
      For other's weal availed on high,
    Mine will not all be lost in air,
      But waft thy name beyond the sky.
    'Twere vain to speak--to weep--to sigh:
      Oh! more than tears of blood can tell,
    When wrung from Guilt's expiring eye,
      Are in that word--Farewell!--Farewell!

                    2.

    These lips are mute, these eyes are dry;
      But in my breast and in my brain,
    Awake the pangs that pass not by,
      The thought that ne'er shall sleep again.
    My soul nor deigns nor dares complain,
      Though Grief and Passion there rebel:
    I only know we loved in vain--
      I only feel--Farewell!--Farewell!
        
                    WHEN WE TWO PARTED.

                    1.

    When we two parted
      In silence and tears,
    Half broken-hearted
      To sever for years,
    Pale grew thy cheek and cold,
      Colder thy kiss;
    Truly that hour foretold
      Sorrow to this.

                    2.

    The dew of the morning
      Sunk chill on my brow--
    It felt like the warning
      Of what I feel now.
    Thy vows are all broken,
      And light is thy fame:
    I hear thy name spoken,
      And share in its shame.

                    3.

    They name thee before me,
      A knell to mine ear;
    A shudder comes o'er me--
      Why wert thou so dear?
    They know not I knew thee,
      Who knew thee too well:--
    Long, long shall I rue thee,
      Too deeply to tell.

                    4.

    In secret we met--
      In silence I grieve.
    That thy heart could forget,
      Thy spirit deceive.
    If I should meet thee
      After long years,
    How should I greet thee?--
      With silence and tears.
                              
                   LOVE AND GOLD

                    1.

    I cannot talk of Love to thee,
      Though thou art young and free and fair!
    There is a spell thou dost not see,
      That bids a genuine love despair.

                    2.

    And yet that spell invites each youth,
      For thee to sigh, or seem to sigh;
    Makes falsehood wear the garb of truth,
      And Truth itself appear a lie.

                    3.

    If ever Doubt a place possest
      In woman's heart, 'twere wise in thine:
    Admit not Love into thy breast,
      Doubt others' love, nor trust in mine.

                    4.

    Perchance 'tis feigned, perchance sincere,
      But false or true thou canst not tell;
    So much hast thou from all to fear,
      In that unconquerable spell.

                    5.

    Of all the herd that throng around,
      Thy simpering or thy sighing train,
    Come tell me who to thee is bound
      By Love's or Plutus' heavier chain.

                    6.

    In some 'tis Nature, some 'tis Art
      That bids them worship at thy shrine;
    But thou deserv'st a better heart,
      Than they or I can give for thine.

                    7.

    For thee, and such as thee, behold,
      Is Fortune painted truly--blind!
    Who doomed thee to be bought or sold,
      Has proved too bounteous to be kind.

                    8.

    Each day some tempter's crafty suit
      Would woo thee to a loveless bed:
    I see thee to the altar's foot
      A decorated victim led.

                    9.

    Adieu, dear maid! I must not speak
      Whate'er my secret thoughts may be;
    Though thou art all that man can reck
      I dare not talk of Love to thee.

                    1.

    I speak not, I trace not, I breathe not thy name,
    There is grief in the sound, there is guilt in the fame:
    But the tear which now burns on my cheek may impart
    The deep thoughts that dwell in that silence of heart.

                    2.

    Too brief for our passion, too long for our peace,
    Were those hours--can their joy or their bitterness cease?
    We repent, we abjure, we will break from our chain,--
    We will part, we will fly to--unite it again!

                    3.

    Oh! thine be the gladness, and mine be the guilt!
    Forgive me, adored one!--forsake, if thou wilt;--
    But the heart which is thine shall expire undebased
    And man shall not break it--whatever thou mayst.

                    4.

    And stern to the haughty, but humble to thee,
    This soul, in its bitterest blackness, shall be:
    And our days seem as swift, and our moments more sweet,
    With thee by my side, than with worlds at our feet.

                    5.

    One sigh of thy sorrow, one look of thy love,
    Shall turn me or fix, shall reward or reprove;
    And the heartless may wonder at all I resign--
    Thy lip shall reply, not to them, but to mine.
                                                           
             ADDRESS INTENDED TO BE RECITED AT
                THE CALEDONIAN MEETING.

    Who hath not glowed above the page where Fame
    Hath fixed high Caledon's unconquered name;
    The mountain-land which spurned the Roman chain,
    And baffled back the fiery-crested Dane,
    Whose bright claymore and hardihood of hand
    No foe could tame--no tyrant could command?
    That race is gone--but still their children breathe,
    And Glory crowns them with redoubled wreath:
    O'er Gael and Saxon mingling banners shine,
    And, England! add their stubborn strength to thine.
    The blood which flowed with Wallace flows as free,
    But now 'tis only shed for Fame and thee!
    Oh! pass not by the northern veteran's claim,
    But give support--the world hath given him fame!

    The humbler ranks, the lowly brave, who bled
    While cheerly following where the Mighty led--
    Who sleep beneath the undistinguished sod
    Where happier comrades in their triumph trod,
    To us bequeath--'tis all their fate allows--
    The sireless offspring and the lonely spouse:
    She on high Albyn's dusky hills may raise
    The tearful eye in melancholy gaze,
    Or view, while shadowy auguries disclose
    The Highland Seer's anticipated woes,
    The bleeding phantom of each martial form
    Dim in the cloud, or darkling in the storm;
    While sad, she chaunts the solitary song,
    The soft lament for him who tarries long--
    For him, whose distant relics vainly crave
    The Coronach's wild requiem to the brave!

    'Tis Heaven--not man--must charm away the woe,
    Which bursts when Nature's feelings newly flow;
    Yet Tenderness and Time may rob the tear
    Of half its bitterness for one so dear;
    A Nation's gratitude perchance may spread
    A thornless pillow for the widowed head;
    May lighten well her heart's maternal care,
    And wean from Penury the soldier's heir;
    Or deem to living war-worn Valour just
    Each wounded remnant--Albion's cherished trust--
    Warm his decline with those endearing rays,
    Whose bounteous sunshine yet may gild his days--
    So shall that Country--while he sinks to rest--
    His hand hath fought for--by his heart be blest!
                                                              
              ELEGIAC STANZAS ON THE DEATH OF
                SIR PETER PARKER, BART.

                    1.

    There is a tear for all that die,
      A mourner o'er the humblest grave;
    But nations swell the funeral cry,
      And Triumph weeps above the brave.

                    2.

    For them is Sorrow's purest sigh
      O'er Ocean's heaving bosom sent:
    In vain their bones unburied lie,
      All earth becomes their monument!

                    3.

    A tomb is theirs on every page,
      An epitaph on every tongue:
    The present hours, the future age,
      For them bewail, to them belong.

                    4.

    For them the voice of festal mirth
      Grows hushed, their name the only sound;
    While deep Remembrance pours to Worth
      The goblet's tributary round.

                    5.

    A theme to crowds that knew them not,
      Lamented by admiring foes,
    Who would not share their glorious lot?
      Who would not die the death they chose?

                    6.

    And, gallant Parker! thus enshrined
      Thy life, thy fall, thy fame shall be;
    And early valour, glowing, find
      A model in thy memory.

                    7.

    But there are breasts that bleed with thee
      In woe, that glory cannot quell;
    And shuddering hear of victory,
      Where one so dear, so dauntless, fell.

                    8.

    Where shall they turn to mourn thee less?
      When cease to hear thy cherished name?
    Time cannot teach forgetfulness,
      While Grief's full heart is fed by Fame.

                    9.

    Alas! for them, though not for thee,
      They cannot choose but weep the more;
    Deep for the dead the grief must be,
      Who ne'er gave cause to mourn before.

                 JULIAN

                    1.

    The Night came on the Waters--all was rest
    On Earth--but Rage on Ocean's troubled Heart.
    The Waves arose and rolled beneath the blast;
    The Sailors gazed upon their shivered Mast.
    In that dark Hour a long loud gathered cry
    From out the billows pierced the sable sky,
    And borne o'er breakers reached the craggy shore--
    The Sea roars on--that Cry is heard no more.

                    2.

    There is no vestige, in the Dawning light,
    Of those that shrieked thro' shadows of the Night.
    The Bark--the Crew--the very Wreck is gone,
    Marred--mutilated--traceless--all save one.
    In him there still is Life, the Wave that dashed
    On shore the plank to which his form was lashed,
    Returned unheeding of its helpless Prey--
    The lone survivor of that Yesterday--
    The one of Many whom the withering Gale
    Hath left unpunished to record their Tale.
    But who shall hear it? on that barren Sand
    None comes to stretch the hospitable hand.
    That shore reveals no print of human foot,
    Nor e'en the pawing of the wilder Brute;
    And niggard vegetation will not smile,
    All sunless on that solitary Isle.

                    3.

    The naked Stranger rose, and wrung his hair,
    And that first moment passed in silent prayer.
    Alas! the sound--he sunk into Despair--
    He was on Earth--but what was Earth to him,
    Houseless and homeless--bare both breast and limb?
    Cut off from all but Memory he curst
    His fate--his folly--but himself the worst.
    What was his hope? he looked upon the Wave--
    Despite--of all--it still may be his Grave!

                    4.

    He rose and with a feeble effort shaped
    His course unto the billows--late escaped:
    But weakness conquered--swam his dizzy glance,
    And down to Earth he sunk in silent trance.
    How long his senses bore its chilling chain,
    He knew not--but, recalled to Life again,
    A stranger stood beside his shivering form--
    And what was he? had he too scaped the storm?

                    5.

    He raised young Julian. "Is thy Cup so full
    Of bitterness--thy Hope--thy heart so dull
    That thou shouldst from Thee dash the Draught of Life,
    So late escaped the elemental strife!
    Rise--tho' these shores few aids to Life supply,
    Look upon me, and know thou shalt not die.
    Thou gazest in mute wonder--more may be
    Thy marvel when thou knowest mine and me.
    But come--The bark that bears us hence shall find
    Her Haven, soon, despite the warning Wind."

                    6.

    He raised young Julian from the sand, and such
    Strange power of healing dwelt within the touch,
    That his weak limbs grew light with freshened Power,
    As he had slept not fainted in that hour,
    And woke from Slumber--as the Birds awake,
    Recalled at morning from the branched brake,
    When the day's promise heralds early Spring,
    And Heaven unfolded woos their soaring wing:
    So Julian felt, and gazed upon his Guide,
    With honest Wonder what might next betide.

    Belshazzar! from the banquet turn,
      Nor in thy sensual fulness fall;
    Behold! while yet before thee burn
      The graven words, the glowing wall,
    Many a despot men miscall
      Crowned and anointed from on high;
    But thou, the weakest, worst of all--
      Is it not written, thou must die?

                    2.

    Go! dash the roses from thy brow--
      Grey hairs but poorly wreathe with them;
    Youth's garlands misbecome thee now,
      More than thy very diadem,
    Where thou hast tarnished every gem:--
      Then throw the worthless bauble by,
    Which, worn by thee, ev'n slaves contemn;
      And learn like better men to die!

                    3.

    Oh! early in the balance weighed,
      And ever light of word and worth,
    Whose soul expired ere youth decayed,
      And left thee but a mass of earth.
    To see thee moves the scorner's mirth:
      But tears in Hope's averted eye
    Lament that even thou hadst birth--
      Unfit to govern, live, or die.

    There's not a joy the world can give like that it takes away,
    When the glow of early thought declines in Feeling's dull decay;
    'Tis not on Youth's smooth cheek the blush alone, which fades
                                                        so fast,
    But the tender bloom of heart is gone, ere Youth itself be past.

                    2.

    Then the few whose spirits float above the wreck of happiness
    Are driven o'er the shoals of guilt or ocean of excess:
    The magnet of their course is gone, or only points in vain
    The shore to which their shivered sail shall never stretch again.

                    3.

    Then the mortal coldness of the soul like Death itself comes down;
    It cannot feel for others' woes, it dare not dream its own;
    That heavy chill has frozen o'er the fountain of our tears,
    And though the eye may sparkle still, 'tis where the ice appears.

    Though wit may flash from fluent lips, and mirth distract the breast,

      Its tears refuse to start;
    But every drop, it bids me dry,
      Falls dreary on my heart.

    They cannot petrify more fast,
      Than feelings sunk remain,
    Which coldly fixed regard the past,
      But never melt again.

    E'er burst from its mortal control,
      In the orbs of the blessed to shine.
    On earth thou wert all but divine,
      As thy soul shall immortally be;
    And our sorrow may cease to repine
      When we know that thy God is with thee.

                    2.

    Light be the turf of thy tomb!
      May its verdure like emeralds be!
    There should not be the shadow of gloom
      In aught that reminds us of thee.
    Young flowers and an evergreen tree
      May spring from the spot of thy rest:
    But nor cypress nor yew let us see;
      For why should we mourn for the blest?
                            
                 NAPOLEON'S FAREWELL.

                    1.

    Farewell to the Land, where the gloom of my Glory
    Arose and o'ershadowed the earth with her name--
    She abandons me now--but the page of her story,
    The brightest or blackest, is filled with my fame.
    I have warred with a World which vanquished me only
    When the meteor of conquest allured me too far;
    I have coped with the nations which dread me thus lonely,
    The last single Captive to millions in war.

                    2.

    Farewell to thee, France! when thy diadem crowned me,
    I made thee the gem and the wonder of earth,--
    But thy weakness decrees I should leave as I found thee,
    Decayed in thy glory, and sunk in thy worth.
    Oh! for the veteran hearts that were wasted
    In strife with the storm, when their battles were won--
    Then the Eagle, whose gaze in that moment was blasted
    Had still soared with eyes fixed on Victory's sun!

                    3.

    Farewell to thee, France!--but when Liberty rallies
    Once more in thy regions, remember me then,--
    The Violet still grows in the depth of thy valleys;
    Though withered, thy tear will unfold it again--
    Yet, yet, I may baffle the hosts that surround us,
    And yet may thy heart leap awake to my voice--
    There are links which must break in the chain that has bound us,
    Then turn thee and call on the Chief of thy choice!
                                                 
                   FROM THE FRENCH.

                    I.

    Must thou go, my glorious Chief,
      Severed from thy faithful few?
    Who can tell thy warrior's grief,
      Maddening o'er that long adieu?
    Woman's love, and Friendship's zeal,
      Dear as both have been to me--
    What are they to all I feel,
      With a soldier's faith for thee?

                    II.

    Idol of the soldier's soul!
      First in fight, but mightiest now;
    Many could a world control;
      Thee alone no doom can bow.
    By thy side for years I dared
      Death; and envied those who fell,
    When their dying shout was heard,
      Blessing him they served so well.

                    III.

    Would that I were cold with those,
      Since this hour I live to see;
    When the doubts of coward foes
      Scarce dare trust a man with thee,
    Dreading each should set thee free!
      Oh! although in dungeons pent,
    All their chains were light to me,
      Gazing on thy soul unbent.

                    IV.

    Would the sycophants of him
      Now so deaf to duty's prayer,
    Were his borrowed glories dim,
      In his native darkness share?
    Were that world this hour his own,
      All thou calmly dost resign,
    Could he purchase with that throne
      Hearts like those which still are thine?

                    V.

    My Chief, my King, my Friend, adieu!
      Never did I droop before;
    Never to my Sovereign sue,
      As his foes I now implore:
    All I ask is to divide
      Every peril he must brave;
    Sharing by the hero's side
      His fall--his exile--and his grave.
                                     
                 ODE FROM THE FRENCH.

                    I.

    We do not curse thee, Waterloo!
    Though Freedom's blood thy plain bedew;
    There 'twas shed, but is not sunk--
    Rising from each gory trunk,
    Like the water-spout from ocean,
    With a strong and growing motion--
    It soars, and mingles in the air,
    With that of lost La Bedoyere--
    With that of him whose honoured grave
    Contains the "bravest of the brave."
    A crimson cloud it spreads and glows,
    But shall return to whence it rose;
    When 'tis full 'twill burst asunder--
    Never yet was heard such thunder
    As then shall shake the world with wonder--
    Never yet was seen such lightning
    As o'er heaven shall then be bright'ning!
    Like the Wormwood Star foretold
      By the sainted Seer of old,
    Show'ring down a fiery flood,
    Turning rivers into blood.

                    II.

    The Chief has fallen, but not by you,
    Vanquishers of Waterloo!
    When the soldier citizen
    Swayed not o'er his fellow-men--
    Save in deeds that led them on
    Where Glory smiled on Freedom's son--
    Who, of all the despots banded,
      With that youthful chief competed?
      Who could boast o'er France defeated,
    Till lone Tyranny commanded?
    Till, goaded by Ambition's sting,
    The Hero sunk into the King?
    Then he fell:--so perish all,
    Who would men by man enthral!

                    III.

    And thou, too, of the snow-white plume!
    Whose realm refused thee ev'n a tomb;
    Better hadst thou still been leading
    France o'er hosts of hirelings bleeding,
    Than sold thyself to death and shame
    For a meanly royal name;
    Such as he of Naples wears,
    Who thy blood-bought title bears.
    Little didst thou deem, when dashing
      On thy war-horse through the ranks.
      Like a stream which burst its banks,
    While helmets cleft, and sabres clashing,
    Shone and shivered fast around thee--
    Of the fate at last which found thee:
    Was that haughty plume laid low
    By a slave's dishonest blow?
    Once--as the Moon sways o'er the tide,
    It rolled in air, the warrior's guide;
    Through the smoke-created night
    Of the black and sulphurous fight,
    The soldier raised his seeking eye
    To catch that crest's ascendancy,--
    And, as it onward rolling rose,
    So moved his heart upon our foes.
    There, where death's brief pang was quickest,
    And the battle's wreck lay thickest,
    Strewed beneath the advancing banner
      Of the eagle's burning crest--
    (There with thunder-clouds to fan her,
      Who could then her wing arrest--
      Victory beaming from her breast?)
    While the broken line enlarging
      Fell, or fled along the plain;
    There be sure was Murat charging!
      There he ne'er shall charge again!

                    IV.

    O'er glories gone the invaders march,
    Weeps Triumph o'er each levelled arch--
    But let Freedom rejoice,
    With her heart in her voice;
    But, her hand on her sword,
    Doubly shall she be adored;
    France hath twice too well been taught
    The "moral lesson" dearly bought--
    Her safety sits not on a throne,
    With Capet or Napoleon!
    But in equal rights and laws,
    Hearts and hands in one great cause--
    Freedom, such as God hath given
    Unto all beneath his heaven,
    With their breath, and from their birth,
    Though guilt would sweep it from the earth;
    With a fierce and lavish hand
    Scattering nations' wealth like sand;
    Pouring nations' blood like water,
    In imperial seas of slaughter!

                    V.

    But the heart and the mind,
    And the voice of mankind,
    Shall arise in communion--
    And who shall resist that proud union?
    The time is past when swords subdued--
    Man may die--the soul's renewed:
    Even in this low world of care
    Freedom ne'er shall want an heir;
    Millions breathe but to inherit
    Her for ever bounding spirit--
    When once more her hosts assemble,
    Tyrants shall believe and tremble--
    Smile they at this idle threat?
    Crimson tears will follow yet.
              
                     STANZAS FOR MUSIC.

                    1.

    There be none of Beauty's daughters
      With a magic like thee;
    And like music on the waters
      Is thy sweet voice to me:
    When, as if its sound were causing
    The charmed Ocean's pausing,
    The waves lie still and gleaming,
    And the lulled winds seem dreaming:

                    2.

    And the midnight Moon is weaving
      Her bright chain o'er the deep;
    Whose breast is gently heaving,
      As an infant's asleep:
    So the spirit bows before thee,
    To listen and adore thee;
    With a full but soft emotion,
    Like the swell of Summer's ocean.
                                                       
        ON THE STAR OF "THE LEGION OF HONOUR."
        
                    1.

    Star of the brave!--whose beam hath shed
    Such glory o'er the quick and dead--
    Thou radiant and adored deceit!
    Which millions rushed in arms to greet,--
    Wild meteor of immortal birth!
    Why rise in Heaven to set on Earth?

                    2.

    Souls of slain heroes formed thy rays;
    Eternity flashed through thy blaze;
    The music of thy martial sphere
    Was fame on high and honour here;
    And thy light broke on human eyes,
    Like a Volcano of the skies.

                    3.

    Like lava rolled thy stream of blood,
    And swept down empires with its flood;
    Earth rocked beneath thee to her base,
    As thou didst lighten through all space;
    And the shorn Sun grew dim in air,
    And set while thou wert dwelling there.

                    4.

    Before thee rose, and with thee grew,
    A rainbow of the loveliest hue
    Of three bright colours, each divine,
    And fit for that celestial sign;
    For Freedom's hand had blended them,
    Like tints in an immortal gem.

                    5.

    One tint was of the sunbeam's dyes;
    One, the blue depth of Seraph's eyes;
    One, the pure Spirit's veil of white
    Had robed in radiance of its light:
    The three so mingled did beseem
    The texture of a heavenly dream.

                    6.

    Star of the brave! thy ray is pale,
    And darkness must again prevail!
    But, oh thou Rainbow of the free!
    Our tears and blood must flow for thee.
    When thy bright promise fades away,
    Our life is but a load of clay.

                    7.

    And Freedom hallows with her tread
    The silent cities of the dead;
    For beautiful in death are they
    Who proudly fall in her array;
    And soon, oh, Goddess! may we be
    For evermore with them or thee!

    They say that Hope is happiness;
      But genuine Love must prize the past,
    And Memory wakes the thoughts that bless:
      They rose the first--they set the last;

                    II.

    And all that Memory loves the most
      Was once our only Hope to be,
    And all that Hope adored and lost
      Hath melted into Memory.

    Alas! it is delusion all:

      Nor dare we think on what we are.
                              
                       THE SIEGE OF CORINTH

                                       Pope, Sat. i. 26.

                    THE SIEGE OF CORINTH

    In the year since Jesus died for men,
    Eighteen hundred years and ten,
    We were a gallant company,
    Riding o'er land, and sailing o'er sea.
    Oh! but we went merrily!
    We forded the river, and clomb the high hill,
    Never our steeds for a day stood still;
    Whether we lay in the cave or the shed,
    Our sleep fell soft on the hardest bed;
    Whether we couched in our rough capote,
    On the rougher plank of our gliding boat,
    Or stretched on the beach, or our saddles spread,
    As a pillow beneath the resting head,
    Fresh we woke upon the morrow:
      All our thoughts and words had scope,
      We had health, and we had hope,
    Toil and travel, but no sorrow.
    We were of all tongues and creeds;--
    Some were those who counted beads,
    Some of mosque, and some of church,
      And some, or I mis-say, of neither;
    Yet through the wide world might ye search,
      Nor find a motlier crew nor blither.

    But some are dead, and some are gone,
    And some are scattered and alone,
    And some are rebels on the hills
      That look along Epirus' valleys,
      Where Freedom still at moments rallies,
    And pays in blood Oppression's ills;
      And some are in a far countree,
    And some all restlessly at home;
      But never more, oh! never, we
    Shall meet to revel and to roam.
    But those hardy days flew cheerily!
    And when they now fall drearily,
    My thoughts, like swallows, skim the main,
    And bear my spirit back again
    Over the earth, and through the air,
    A wild bird and a wanderer.
    'Tis this that ever wakes my strain,
    And oft, too oft, implores again
    The few who may endure my lay,
    To follow me so far away.
    Stranger, wilt thou follow now,
    And sit with me on Acro-Corinth's brow?

                    I.

    Many a vanished year and age,
    And Tempest's breath, and Battle's rage,
    Have swept o'er Corinth; yet she stands,
    A fortress formed to Freedom's hands.
    The Whirlwind's wrath, the Earthquake's shock,
    Have left untouched her hoary rock,
    The keystone of a land, which still,
    Though fall'n, looks proudly on that hill,
    The landmark to the double tide
    That purpling rolls on either side,
    As if their waters chafed to meet,
    Yet pause and crouch beneath her feet.
    But could the blood before her shed
    Since first Timoleon's brother bled,
    Or baffled Persia's despot fled,
    Arise from out the Earth which drank
    The stream of Slaughter as it sank,
    That sanguine Ocean would o'erflow
    Her isthmus idly spread below:
    Or could the bones of all the slain,
    Who perished there, be piled again,
    That rival pyramid would rise
    More mountain-like, through those clear skies
    Than yon tower-capp'd Acropolis,
    Which seems the very clouds to kiss.

                    II.

    On dun Cithaeron's ridge appears
    The gleam of twice ten thousand spears;
    And downward to the Isthmian plain,
    From shore to shore of either main,
    The tent is pitched, the Crescent shines
    Along the Moslem's leaguering lines;
    And the dusk Spahi's bands advance
    Beneath each bearded Pacha's glance;
    And far and wide as eye can reach
    The turbaned cohorts throng the beach;
    And there the Arab's camel kneels,
    And there his steed the Tartar wheels;
    The Turcoman hath left his herd,
    The sabre round his loins to gird;
    And there the volleying thunders pour,
    Till waves grow smoother to the roar.
    The trench is dug, the cannon's breath
    Wings the far hissing globe of death;
    Fast whirl the fragments from the wall,
    Which crumbles with the ponderous ball;
    And from that wall the foe replies,
    O'er dusty plain and smoky skies,
    With fares that answer fast and well
    The summons of the Infidel.

                    III.

    But near and nearest to the wall
    Of those who wish and work its fall,
    With deeper skill in War's black art,
    Than Othman's sons, and high of heart
    As any Chief that ever stood
    Triumphant in the fields of blood;
    From post to post, and deed to deed,
    Fast spurring on his reeking steed,
    Where sallying ranks the trench assail,
    And make the foremost Moslem quail;
    Or where the battery, guarded well,
    Remains as yet impregnable,
    Alighting cheerly to inspire
    The soldier slackening in his fire;
    The first and freshest of the host
    Which Stamboul's Sultan there can boast,
    To guide the follower o'er the field,
    To point the tube, the lance to wield,
    Or whirl around the bickering blade;--
    Was Alp, the Adrian renegade!

                    IV.

    From Venice--once a race of worth
    His gentle Sires--he drew his birth;
    But late an exile from her shore,
    Against his countrymen he bore
    The arms they taught to bear; and now
    The turban girt his shaven brow.
    Through many a change had Corinth passed
    With Greece to Venice' rule at last;
    And here, before her walls, with those
    To Greece and Venice equal foes,
    He stood a foe, with all the zeal
    Which young and fiery converts feel,
    Within whose heated bosom throngs
    The memory of a thousand wrongs.
    To him had Venice ceased to be
    Her ancient civic boast--"the Free;"
    And in the palace of St. Mark
    Unnamed accusers in the dark
    Within the "Lion's mouth" had placed
    A charge against him uneffaced:
    He fled in time, and saved his life,
    To waste his future years in strife,
    That taught his land how great her loss
    In him who triumphed o'er the Cross,
    'Gainst which he reared the Crescent high,
    And battled to avenge or die.

                    V.

    Coumourgi--he whose closing scene
    Adorned the triumph of Eugene,
    When on Carlowitz' bloody plain,
    The last and mightiest of the slain,
    He sank, regretting not to die,
    But cursed the Christian's victory--
    Coumourgi--can his glory cease,
    That latest conqueror of Greece,
    Till Christian hands to Greece restore
    The freedom Venice gave of yore?
    A hundred years have rolled away
    Since he refixed the Moslem's sway;
    And now he led the Mussulman,
    And gave the guidance of the van
    To Alp, who well repaid the trust
    By cities levelled with the dust;
    And proved, by many a deed of death,
    How firm his heart in novel faith.

                    VI.

    The walls grew weak; and fast and hot
    Against them poured the ceaseless shot,
    With unabating fury sent
    From battery to battlement;
    And thunder-like the pealing din
    Rose from each heated culverin;
    And here and there some crackling dome
    Was fired before the exploding bomb;
    And as the fabric sank beneath
    The shattering shell's volcanic breath,
    In red and wreathing columns flashed
    The flame, as loud the ruin crashed,
    Or into countless meteors driven,
    Its earth-stars melted into heaven;
    Whose clouds that day grew doubly dun,
    Impervious to the hidden sun,
    With volumed smoke that slowly grew
    To one wide sky of sulphurous hue.

                    VII.

    But not for vengeance, long delayed,
    Alone, did Alp, the renegade,
    The Moslem warriors sternly teach
    His skill to pierce the promised breach:
    Within these walls a Maid was pent
    His hope would win, without consent
    Of that inexorable Sire,
    Whose heart refused him in its ire,
    When Alp, beneath his Christian name,
    Her virgin hand aspired to claim.
    In happier mood, and earlier time,
    While unimpeached for traitorous crime,
    Gayest in Gondola or Hall,
    He glittered through the Carnival;
    And tuned the softest serenade
    That e'er on Adria's waters played
    At midnight to Italian maid.

                    VIII.

    And many deemed her heart was won;
    For sought by numbers, given to none,
    Had young Francesca's hand remained
    Still by the Church's bonds unchained:
    And when the Adriatic bore
    Lanciotto to the Paynim shore,
    Her wonted smiles were seen to fail,
    And pensive waxed the maid and pale;
    More constant at confessional,
    More rare at masque and festival;
    Or seen at such, with downcast eyes,
    Which conquered hearts they ceased to prize:
    With listless look she seems to gaze:
    With humbler care her form arrays;
    Her voice less lively in the song;
    Her step, though light, less fleet among
    The pairs, on whom the Morning's glance
    Breaks, yet unsated with the dance.

                    IX.

    Sent by the State to guard the land,
    (Which, wrested from the Moslem's hand,
    While Sobieski tamed his pride
    By Buda's wall and Danube's side,
    The chiefs of Venice wrung away
    From Patra to Euboea's bay,)
    Minotti held in Corinth's towers
    The Doge's delegated powers,
    While yet the pitying eye of Peace
    Smiled o'er her long forgotten Greece:
    And ere that faithless truce was broke
    Which freed her from the unchristian yoke,
    With him his gentle daughter came;
    Nor there, since Menelaus' dame
    Forsook her lord and land, to prove
    What woes await on lawless love,
    Had fairer form adorned the shore
    Than she, the matchless stranger, bore.

    The wall is rent, the ruins yawn;
    And, with to-morrow's earliest dawn,
    O'er the disjointed mass shall vault
    The foremost of the fierce assault.
    The bands are ranked--the chosen van
    Of Tartar and of Mussulman,
    The full of hope, misnamed "forlorn,"
    Who hold the thought of death in scorn,
    And win their way with falchion's force,
    Or pave the path with many a corse,
    O'er which the following brave may rise,
    Their stepping-stone--the last who dies!

                    XI.

    'Tis midnight: on the mountains brown
    The cold, round moon shines deeply down;
    Blue roll the waters, blue the sky
    Spreads like an ocean hung on high,
    Bespangled with those isles of light,
    So wildly, spiritually bright;
    Who ever gazed upon them shining
    And turned to earth without repining,
    Nor wished for wings to flee away,
    And mix with their eternal ray?
    The waves on either shore lay there
    Calm, clear, and azure as the air;
    And scarce their foam the pebbles shook,
    But murmured meekly as the brook.
    The winds were pillowed on the waves;
    The banners drooped along their staves,
    And, as they fell around them furling,
    Above them shone the crescent curling;
    And that deep silence was unbroke,
    Save where the watch his signal spoke,
    Save where the steed neighed oft and shrill,
    And echo answered from the hill,
    And the wide hum of that wild host
    Rustled like leaves from coast to coast,
    As rose the Muezzin's voice in air
    In midnight call to wonted prayer;
    It rose, that chanted mournful strain,
    Like some lone Spirit's o'er the plain:
    'Twas musical, but sadly sweet,
    Such as when winds and harp-strings meet,
    And take a long unmeasured tone,
    To mortal minstrelsy unknown.
    It seemed to those within the wall
    A cry prophetic of their fall:
    It struck even the besieger's ear
    With something ominous and drear,
    An undefined and sudden thrill,
    Which makes the heart a moment still,
    Then beat with quicker pulse, ashamed
    Of that strange sense its silence framed;
    Such as a sudden passing-bell
    Wakes, though but for a stranger's knell.

                    XII.

    The tent of Alp was on the shore;
    The sound was hushed, the prayer was o'er;
    The watch was set, the night-round made,
    All mandates issued and obeyed:
    'Tis but another anxious night,
    His pains the morrow may requite
    With all Revenge and Love can pay,
    In guerdon for their long delay.
    Few hours remain, and he hath need
    Of rest, to nerve for many a deed
    Of slaughter; but within his soul
    The thoughts like troubled waters roll.
    He stood alone among the host;
    Not his the loud fanatic boast
    To plant the Crescent o'er the Cross,
    Or risk a life with little loss,
    Secure in paradise to be
    By Houris loved immortally:
    Nor his, what burning patriots feel,
    The stern exaltedness of zeal,
    Profuse of blood, untired in toil,
    When battling on the parent soil.
    He stood alone--a renegade
    Against the country he betrayed;
    He stood alone amidst his band,
    Without a trusted heart or hand:
    They followed him, for he was brave,
    And great the spoil he got and gave;
    They crouched to him, for he had skill
    To warp and wield the vulgar will:
    But still his Christian origin
    With them was little less than sin.
    They envied even the faithless fame
    He earned beneath a Moslem name;
    Since he, their mightiest chief, had been
    In youth a bitter Nazarene.
    They did not know how Pride can stoop,
    When baffled feelings withering droop;
    They did not know how Hate can burn
    In hearts once changed from soft to stern;
    Nor all the false and fatal zeal
    The convert of Revenge can feel.
    He ruled them--man may rule the worst,
    By ever daring to be first:
    So lions o'er the jackals sway;
    The jackal points, he fells the prey,
    Then on the vulgar, yelling, press,
    To gorge the relics of success.

                    XIII.

    His head grows fevered, and his pulse
    The quick successive throbs convulse;
    In vain from side to side he throws
    His form, in courtship of repose;
    Or if he dozed, a sound, a start
    Awoke him with a sunken heart.
    The turban on his hot brow pressed,
    The mail weighed lead-like on his breast,
    Though oft and long beneath its weight
    Upon his eyes had slumber sate,
    Without or couch or canopy,
    Except a rougher field and sky
    Than now might yield a warrior's bed,
    Than now along the heaven was spread.
    He could not rest, he could not stay
    Within his tent to wait for day,
    But walked him forth along the sand,
    Where thousand sleepers strewed the strand.
    What pillowed them? and why should he
    More wakeful than the humblest be,
    Since more their peril, worse their toil?
    And yet they fearless dream of spoil;
    While he alone, where thousands passed
    A night of sleep, perchance their last,
    In sickly vigil wandered on,
    And envied all he gazed upon.

                    XIV.

    He felt his soul become more light
    Beneath the freshness of the night.
    Cool was the silent sky, though calm,
    And bathed his brow with airy balm:
    Behind, the camp--before him lay,
    In many a winding creek and bay,
    Lepanto's gulf; and, on the brow
    Of Delphi's hill, unshaken snow,
    High and eternal, such as shone
    Through thousand summers brightly gone,
    Along the gulf, the mount, the clime;
    It will not melt, like man, to time:
    Tyrant and slave are swept away,
    Less formed to wear before the ray;
    But that white veil, the lightest, frailest,
    Which on the mighty mount thou hailest,
    While tower and tree are torn and rent,
    Shines o'er its craggy battlement;
    In form a peak, in height a cloud,
    In texture like a hovering shroud,
    Thus high by parting Freedom spread,
    As from her fond abode she fled,
    And lingered on the spot, where long
    Her prophet spirit spake in song.
    Oh! still her step at moments falters
    O'er withered fields, and ruined altars,
    And fain would wake, in souls too broken,
    By pointing to each glorious token:
    But vain her voice, till better days
    Dawn in those yet remembered rays,
    Which shone upon the Persian flying,
    And saw the Spartan smile in dying.

                    XV.

    Not mindless of these mighty times
    Was Alp, despite his flight and crimes;
    And through this night, as on he wandered,
    And o'er the past and present pondered,
    And thought upon the glorious dead
    Who there in better cause had bled,
    He felt how faint and feebly dim
    The fame that could accrue to him,
    Who cheered the band, and waved the sword,
    A traitor in a turbaned horde;
    And led them to the lawless siege,
    Whose best success were sacrilege.
    Not so had those his fancy numbered,
    The chiefs whose dust around him slumbered;
    Their phalanx marshalled on the plain,
    Whose bulwarks were not then in vain.
    They fell devoted, but undying;
    The very gale their names seemed sighing;
    The waters murmured of their name;
    The woods were peopled with their fame;
    The silent pillar, lone and grey,
    Claimed kindred with their sacred clay;
    Their spirits wrapped the dusky mountain,
    Their memory sparkled o'er the fountain;
    The meanest rill, the mightiest river
    Rolled mingling with their fame for ever.
    Despite of every yoke she bears,
    That land is Glory's still and theirs!
    'Tis still a watch-word to the earth:
    When man would do a deed of worth
    He points to Greece, and turns to tread,
    So sanctioned, on the tyrant's head:
    He looks to her, and rushes on
    Where life is lost, or Freedom won.

                    XVI.

    Still by the shore Alp mutely mused,
    And wooed the freshness Night diffused.
    There shrinks no ebb in that tideless sea,
    Which changeless rolls eternally;
    So that wildest of waves, in their angriest mood,
    Scarce break on the bounds of the land for a rood;
    And the powerless moon beholds them flow,
    Heedless if she come or go:
    Calm or high, in main or bay,
    On their course she hath no sway.
    The rock unworn its base doth bare,
    And looks o'er the surf, but it comes not there;
    And the fringe of the foam may be seen below,
    On the line that it left long ages ago:
    A smooth short space of yellow sand
    Between it and the greener land.

    He wandered on along the beach,
    Till within the range of a carbine's reach
    Of the leaguered wall; but they saw him not,
    Or how could he 'scape from the hostile shot?
    Did traitors lurk in the Christians' hold?
    Were their hands grown stiff, or their hearts waxed cold?
    I know not, in sooth; but from yonder wall
    There flashed no fire, and there hissed no ball,
    Though he stood beneath the bastion's frown,
    That flanked the seaward gate of the town;
    Though he heard the sound, and could almost tell
    The sullen words of the sentinel,
    As his measured step on the stone below
    Clanked, as he paced it to and fro;
    And he saw the lean dogs beneath the wall
    Hold o'er the dead their Carnival,
    Gorging and growling o'er carcass and limb;
    They were too busy to bark at him!
    From a Tartar's skull they had stripped the flesh,
    As ye peel the fig when its fruit is fresh;
    And their white tusks crunched o'er the whiter skull,
    As it slipped through their jaws, when their edge grew dull,
    As they lazily mumbled the bones of the dead,
    When they scarce could rise from the spot where they fed;
    So well had they broken a lingering fast
    With those who had fallen for that night's repast.
    And Alp knew, by the turbans that rolled on the sand,
    The foremost of these were the best of his band:
    Crimson and green were the shawls of their wear,
    And each scalp had a single long tuft of hair,
    All the rest was shaven and bare.
    The scalps were in the wild dog's maw,
    The hair was tangled round his jaw:
    But close by the shore, on the edge of the gulf,
    There sat a vulture flapping a wolf,
    Who had stolen from the hills, but kept away,
    Scared by the dogs, from the human prey;
    But he seized on his share of a steed that lay,
    Picked by the birds, on the sands of the bay.

                    XVII.

    Alp turned him from the sickening sight:
    Never had shaken his nerves in fight;
    But he better could brook to behold the dying,
    Deep in the tide of their warm blood lying,
    Scorched with the death-thirst, and writhing in vain,
    Than the perishing dead who are past all pain.
    There is something of pride in the perilous hour,
    Whate'er be the shape in which Death may lower;
    For Fame is there to say who bleeds,
    And Honour's eye on daring deeds!
    But when all is past, it is humbling to tread
    O'er the weltering field of the tombless dead,
    And see worms of the earth, and fowls of the air,
    Beasts of the forest, all gathering there;
    All regarding man as their prey,
    All rejoicing in his decay.

                    XVIII.

    There is a temple in ruin stands,
    Fashioned by long forgotten hands;
    Two or three columns, and many a stone,
    Marble and granite, with grass o'ergrown!
    Out upon Time! it will leave no more
    Of the things to come than the things before!
    Out upon Time! who for ever will leave
    But enough of the past for the future to grieve
    O'er that which hath been, and o'er that which must be:
    What we have seen, our sons shall see;
    Remnants of things that have passed away,
    Fragments of stone, reared by creatures of clay!

                    XIX.

    He sate him down at a pillar's base,
    And passed his hand athwart his face;
    Like one in dreary musing mood,
    Declining was his attitude;
    His head was drooping on his breast,
    Fevered, throbbing, and oppressed;
    And o'er his brow, so downward bent,
    Oft his beating fingers went,
    Hurriedly, as you may see
    Your own run over the ivory key,
    Ere the measured tone is taken
    By the chords you would awaken.
    There he sate all heavily,
    As he heard the night-wind sigh.
    Was it the wind through some hollow stone,
    Sent that soft and tender moan?
    He lifted his head, and he looked on the sea,
    But it was unrippled as glass may be;
    He looked on the long grass--it waved not a blade;
    How was that gentle sound conveyed?
    He looked to the banners--each flag lay still,
    So did the leaves on Cithaeron's hill,
    And he felt not a breath come over his cheek;
    What did that sudden sound bespeak?
    He turned to the left--is he sure of sight?
    There sate a lady, youthful and bright!

                    XX.

    He started up with more of fear
    Than if an armed foe were near.
    "God of my fathers! what is here?
    Who art thou? and wherefore sent
    So near a hostile armament?"
    His trembling hands refused to sign
    The cross he deemed no more divine:
    He had resumed it in that hour,
    But Conscience wrung away the power.
    He gazed, he saw; he knew the face
    Of beauty, and the form of grace;
    It was Francesca by his side,
    The maid who might have been his bride!

    The rose was yet upon her cheek,
    But mellowed with a tenderer streak:
    Where was the play of her soft lips fled?
    Gone was the smile that enlivened their red.
    The Ocean's calm within their view,
    Beside her eye had less of blue;
    But like that cold wave it stood still,
    And its glance, though clear, was chill.
    Around her form a thin robe twining,
    Nought concealed her bosom shining;
    Through the parting of her hair,
    Floating darkly downward there,
    Her rounded arm showed white and bare:
    And ere yet she made reply,
    Once she raised her hand on high;
    It was so wan, and transparent of hue,
    You might have seen the moon shine through.

                    XXI.

    "I come from my rest to him I love best,
    That I may be happy, and he may be blessed.
    I have passed the guards, the gate, the wall;
    Sought thee in safety through foes and all.
    'Tis said the lion will turn and flee
    From a maid in the pride of her purity;
    And the Power on high, that can shield the good
    Thus from the tyrant of the wood,
    Hath extended its mercy to guard me as well
    From the hands of the leaguering Infidel.
    I come--and if I come in vain,
    Never, oh never, we meet again!
    Thou hast done a fearful deed
    In falling away from thy fathers' creed:
    But dash that turban to earth, and sign
    The sign of the cross, and for ever be mine;
    Wring the black drop from thy heart,
    And to-morrow unites us no more to part."

    "And where should our bridal couch be spread?
    In the midst of the dying and the dead?
    For to-morrow we give to the slaughter and flame
    The sons and the shrines of the Christian name.
    None, save thou and thine, I've sworn,
    Shall be left upon the morn:
    But thee will I bear to a lovely spot,
    Where our hands shall be joined, and our sorrow forgot.
    There thou yet shall be my bride,
    When once again I've quelled the pride
    Of Venice; and her hated race
    Have felt the arm they would debase
    Scourge, with a whip of scorpions, those
    Whom Vice and Envy made my foes."

    Upon his hand she laid her own--
    Light was the touch, but it thrilled to the bone,
    And shot a chillness to his heart,
    Which fixed him beyond the power to start.
    Though slight was that grasp so mortal cold,
    He could not loose him from its hold;
    But never did clasp of one so dear
    Strike on the pulse with such feeling of fear,
    As those thin fingers, long and white,
    Froze through his blood by their touch that night.
    The feverish glow of his brow was gone,
    And his heart sank so still that it felt like stone,
    As he looked on the face, and beheld its hue,
    So deeply changed from what he knew:
    Fair but faint--without the ray
    Of mind, that made each feature play
    Like sparkling waves on a sunny day;
    And her motionless lips lay still as death,
    And her words came forth without her breath,
    And there rose not a heave o'er her bosom's swell,
    And there seemed not a pulse in her veins to dwell.
    Though her eye shone out, yet the lids were fixed,
    And the glance that it gave was wild and unmixed
    With aught of change, as the eyes may seem
    Of the restless who walk in a troubled dream;
    Like the figures on arras, that gloomily glare,
    Stirred by the breath of the wintry air
    So seen by the dying lamp's fitful light,
    Lifeless, but life-like, and awful to sight;
    As they seem, through the dimness, about to come down
    From the shadowy wall where their images frown;
    Fearfully flitting to and fro,
    As the gusts on the tapestry come and go.

    "If not for love of me be given
    Thus much, then, for the love of Heaven,--
    Again I say--that turban tear
    From off thy faithless brow, and swear
    Thine injured country's sons to spare,
    Or thou art lost; and never shalt see--
    Not earth--that's past--but Heaven or me.
    If this thou dost accord, albeit
    A heavy doom' tis thine to meet,
    That doom shall half absolve thy sin,
    And Mercy's gate may receive thee within:
    But pause one moment more, and take
    The curse of Him thou didst forsake;
    And look once more to Heaven, and see
    Its love for ever shut from thee.
    There is a light cloud by the moon--
    'Tis passing, and will pass full soon--
    If, by the time its vapoury sail
    Hath ceased her shaded orb to veil,
    Thy heart within thee is not changed,
    Then God and man are both avenged;
    Dark will thy doom be, darker still
    Thine immortality of ill."

    Alp looked to heaven, and saw on high
    The sign she spake of in the sky;
    But his heart was swollen, and turned aside,
    By deep interminable pride.
    This first false passion of his breast
    Rolled like a torrent o'er the rest.
    He sue for mercy! He dismayed
    By wild words of a timid maid!
    He, wronged by Venice, vow to save
    Her sons, devoted to the grave!
    No--though that cloud were thunder's worst,
    And charged to crush him--let it burst!

    He looked upon it earnestly,
    Without an accent of reply;
    He watched it passing; it is flown:
    Full on his eye the clear moon shone,
    And thus he spake--"Whate'er my fate,
    I am no changeling--'tis too late:
    The reed in storms may bow and quiver,
    Then rise again; the tree must shiver.
    What Venice made me, I must be,
    Her foe in all, save love to thee:
    But thou art safe: oh, fly with me!"
    He turned, but she is gone!
    Nothing is there but the column stone.
    Hath she sunk in the earth, or melted in air?
    He saw not--he knew not--but nothing is there.

                    XXII.

    The night is past, and shines the sun
    As if that morn were a jocund one.
    Lightly and brightly breaks away
    The Morning from her mantle grey,
    And the Noon will look on a sultry day.
    Hark to the trump, and the drum,
    And the mournful sound of the barbarous horn,
    And the flap of the banners, that flit as they're borne,
    And the neigh of the steed, and the multitude's hum,
    And the clash, and the shout, "They come! they come!"
    The horsetails are plucked from the ground, and the sword
    From its sheath; and they form, and but wait for the word.
    Tartar, and Spahi, and Turcoman,
    Strike your tents, and throng to the van;
    Mount ye, spur ye, skirr the plain,
    That the fugitive may flee in vain,
    When he breaks from the town; and none escape,
    Aged or young, in the Christian shape;
    While your fellows on foot, in a fiery mass,
    Bloodstain the breach through which they pass.
    The steeds are all bridled, and snort to the rein;
    Curved is each neck, and flowing each mane;
    White is the foam of their champ on the bit;
    The spears are uplifted; the matches are lit;
    The cannon are pointed, and ready to roar,
    And crush the wall they have crumbled before:
    Forms in his phalanx each Janizar;
    Alp at their head; his right arm is bare,
    So is the blade of his scimitar;
    The Khan and the Pachas are all at their post;
    The Vizier himself at the head of the host.
    When the culverin's signal is fired, then on;
    Leave not in Corinth a living one--
    A priest at her altars, a chief in her halls,
    A hearth in her mansions, a stone on her walls.
    God and the prophet--Alla Hu!
    Up to the skies with that wild halloo!
    "There the breach lies for passage, the ladder to scale;
    And your hands on your sabres, and how should ye fail?
    He who first downs with the red cross may crave
    His heart's dearest wish; let him ask it, and have!"
    Thus uttered Coumourgi, the dauntless Vizier;
    The reply was the brandish of sabre and spear,
    And the shout of fierce thousands in joyous ire:--
    Silence--hark to the signal--fire!

                    XXIII.

    As the wolves, that headlong go
    On the stately buffalo,
    Though with fiery eyes, and angry roar,
    And hoofs that stamp, and horns that gore,
    He tramples on earth, or tosses on high
    The foremost, who rush on his strength but to die
    Thus against the wall they went,
    Thus the first were backward bent;
    Many a bosom, sheathed in brass,
    Strewed the earth like broken glass,
    Shivered by the shot, that tore
    The ground whereon they moved no more:
    Even as they fell, in files they lay,
    Like the mower's grass at the close of day,
    When his work is done on the levelled plain;
    Such was the fall of the foremost slain.

                    XXIV.

    As the spring-tides, with heavy plash,
    From the cliffs invading dash
    Huge fragments, sapped by the ceaseless flow,
    Till white and thundering down they go,
    Like the avalanche's snow
    On the Alpine vales below;
    Thus at length, outbreathed and worn,
    Corinth's sons were downward borne
    By the long and oft renewed
    Charge of the Moslem multitude.
    In firmness they stood, and in masses they fell,
    Heaped by the host of the Infidel,
    Hand to hand, and foot to foot:
    Nothing there, save Death, was mute;
    Stroke, and thrust, and flash, and cry
    For quarter, or for victory,
    Mingle there with the volleying thunder,
    Which makes the distant cities wonder
    How the sounding battle goes,
    If with them, or for their foes;
    If they must mourn, or may rejoice
    In that annihilating voice,
    Which pierces the deep hills through and through
    With an echo dread and new:
    You might have heard it, on that day,
    O'er Salamis and Megara;
    (We have heard the hearers say,)
    Even unto Piraeus' bay.

                    XXV.

    From the point of encountering blades to the hilt,
    Sabres and swords with blood were gilt;
    But the rampart is won, and the spoil begun,
    And all but the after carnage done.
    Shriller shrieks now mingling come
    From within the plundered dome:
    Hark to the haste of flying feet,
    That splash in the blood of the slippery street;
    But here and there, where 'vantage ground
    Against the foe may still be found,
    Desperate groups, of twelve or ten,
    Make a pause, and turn again--
    With banded backs against the wall,
    Fiercely stand, or fighting fall.
    There stood an old man--his hairs were white,
    But his veteran arm was full of might:
    So gallantly bore he the brunt of the fray,
    The dead before him, on that day,
    In a semicircle lay;
    Still he combated unwounded,
    Though retreating, unsurrounded.
    Many a scar of former fight
    Lurked beneath his corslet bright;
    But of every wound his body bore,
    Each and all had been ta'en before:
    Though aged, he was so iron of limb,
    Few of our youth could cope with him,
    And the foes, whom he singly kept at bay,
    Outnumbered his thin hairs of silver grey.
    From right to left his sabre swept:
    Many an Othman mother wept
    Sons that were unborn, when dipped
    His weapon first in Moslem gore,
    Ere his years could count a score.
    Of all he might have been the sire
    Who fell that day beneath his ire:
    For, sonless left long years ago,
    His wrath made many a childless foe;
    And since the day, when in the strait
    His only boy had met his fate,
    His parent's iron hand did doom
    More than a human hecatomb.
    If shades by carnage be appeased,
    Patroclus' spirit less was pleased
    Than his, Minotti's son, who died
    Where Asia's bounds and ours divide.
    Buried he lay, where thousands before
    For thousands of years were inhumed on the shore;
    What of them is left, to tell
    Where they lie, and how they fell?
    Not a stone on their turf, nor a bone in their graves;
    But they live in the verse that immortally saves.

                    XXVI.

    Hark to the Allah shout! a band
    Of the Mussulman bravest and best is at hand;
    Their leader's nervous arm is bare,
    Swifter to smite, and never to spare--
    Unclothed to the shoulder it waves them on;
    Thus in the fight is he ever known:
    Others a gaudier garb may show,
    To tempt the spoil of the greedy foe;
    Many a hand's on a richer hilt,
    But none on a steel more ruddily gilt;
    Many a loftier turban may wear,--
    Alp is but known by the white arm bare;
    Look through the thick of the fight,'tis there!
    There is not a standard on that shore
    So well advanced the ranks before;
    There is not a banner in Moslem war
    Will lure the Delhis half so far;
    It glances like a falling star!
    Where'er that mighty arm is seen,
    The bravest be, or late have been;
    There the craven cries for quarter
    Vainly to the vengeful Tartar;
    Or the hero, silent lying,
    Scorns to yield a groan in dying;
    Mustering his last feeble blow
    'Gainst the nearest levelled foe,
    Though faint beneath the mutual wound,
    Grappling on the gory ground.

                    XXVII.

    Still the old man stood erect.
    And Alp's career a moment checked.
    "Yield thee, Minotti; quarter take,
    For thine own, thy daughter's sake."

    "Never, Renegado, never!
    Though the life of thy gift would last for ever."

    "Francesca!--Oh, my promised bride!
    Must she too perish by thy pride!"

    "She is safe."--"Where? where?"--"In Heaven;
    From whence thy traitor soul is driven--
    Far from thee, and undefiled."
    Grimly then Minotti smiled,
    As he saw Alp staggering bow
    Before his words, as with a blow.

    "Oh God! when died she?"--"Yesternight--
    Nor weep I for her spirit's flight:
    None of my pure race shall be
    Slaves to Mahomet and thee--
    Come on!"--That challenge is in vain--
    Alp's already with the slain!
    While Minotti's words were wreaking
    More revenge in bitter speaking
    Than his falchion's point had found,
    Had the time allowed to wound,
    From within the neighbouring porch
    Of a long defended church,
    Where the last and desperate few
    Would the failing fight renew,
    The sharp shot dashed Alp to the ground;
    Ere an eye could view the wound
    That crashed through the brain of the infidel,
    Round he spun, and down he fell;
    A flash like fire within his eyes
    Blazed, as he bent no more to rise,
    And then eternal darkness sunk
    Through all the palpitating trunk;
    Nought of life left, save a quivering
    Where his limbs were slightly shivering:
    They turned him on his back; his breast
    And brow were stained with gore and dust,
    And through his lips the life-blood oozed,
    From its deep veins lately loosed;
    But in his pulse there was no throb,
    Nor on his lips one dying sob;
    Sigh, nor word, nor struggling breath
    Heralded his way to death:
    Ere his very thought could pray,
    Unaneled he passed away,
    Without a hope from Mercy's aid,--
    To the last a Renegade.

                    XXVIII.

    Fearfully the yell arose
    Of his followers, and his foes;
    These in joy, in fury those:
    Then again in conflict mixing,
    Clashing swords, and spears transfixing,
    Interchanged the blow and thrust,
    Hurling warriors in the dust.
    Street by street, and foot by foot,
    Still Minotti dares dispute
    The latest portion of the land
    Left beneath his high command;
    With him, aiding heart and hand,
    The remnant of his gallant band.
    Still the church is tenable,
      Whence issued late the fated ball
      That half avenged the city's fall,
    When Alp, her fierce assailant, fell:
    Thither bending sternly back,
    They leave before a bloody track;
    And, with their faces to the foe,
    Dealing wounds with every blow,
    The chief, and his retreating train,
    Join to those within the fane;
    There they yet may breathe awhile,
    Sheltered by the massy pile.

                    XXIX.

    Brief breathing-time! the turbaned host,
    With added ranks and raging boast,
    Press onwards with such strength and heat,
    Their numbers balk their own retreat;
    For narrow the way that led to the spot
    Where still the Christians yielded not;
    And the foremost, if fearful, may vainly try
    Through the massy column to turn and fly;
    They perforce must do or die.
    They die; but ere their eyes could close,
    Avengers o'er their bodies rose;
    Fresh and furious, fast they fill
    The ranks unthinned, though slaughtered still;
    And faint the weary Christians wax
    Before the still renewed attacks:
    And now the Othmans gain the gate;
    Still resists its iron weight,
    And still, all deadly aimed and hot,
    From every crevice comes the shot;
    From every shattered window pour
    The volleys of the sulphurous shower:
    But the portal wavering grows and weak--
    The iron yields, the hinges creak--
    It bends--it falls--and all is o'er;
    Lost Corinth may resist no more!

                    XXX.

    Darkly, sternly, and all alone,
    Minotti stood o'er the altar stone:
    Madonna's face upon him shone,
    Painted in heavenly hues above,
    With eyes of light and looks of love;
    And placed upon that holy shrine
    To fix our thoughts on things divine,
    When pictured there, we kneeling see
    Her, and the boy-God on her knee,
    Smiling sweetly on each prayer
    To Heaven, as if to waft it there.
    Still she smiled; even now she smiles,
    Though slaughter streams along her aisles:
    Minotti lifted his aged eye,
    And made the sign of a cross with a sigh,
    Then seized a torch which blazed thereby;
    And still he stood, while with steel and flame,
    Inward and onward the Mussulman came.

                    XXXI.

    The vaults beneath the mosaic stone
    Contained the dead of ages gone;
    Their names were on the graven floor,
    But now illegible with gore;
    The carved crests, and curious hues
    The varied marble's veins diffuse,
    Were smeared, and slippery--stained, and strown
    With broken swords, and helms o'erthrown:
    There were dead above, and the dead below
    Lay cold in many a coffined row;
    You might see them piled in sable state,
    By a pale light through a gloomy grate;
    But War had entered their dark caves,
    And stored along the vaulted graves
    Her sulphurous treasures, thickly spread
    In masses by the fleshless dead:
    Here, throughout the siege, had been
    The Christians' chiefest magazine;
    To these a late formed train now led,
    Minotti's last and stern resource
    Against the foe's o'erwhelming force.

                    XXXII.

    The foe came on, and few remain
    To strive, and those must strive in vain:
    For lack of further lives, to slake
    The thirst of vengeance now awake,
    With barbarous blows they gash the dead,
    And lop the already lifeless head,
    And fell the statues from their niche,
    And spoil the shrines of offerings rich,
    And from each other's rude hands wrest
    The silver vessels Saints had blessed.
    To the high altar on they go;
    Oh, but it made a glorious show!
    On its table still behold
    The cup of consecrated gold;
    Massy and deep, a glittering prize,
    Brightly it sparkles to plunderers' eyes:
    That morn it held the holy wine,
    Converted by Christ to his blood so divine,
    Which his worshippers drank at the break of day,
    To shrive their souls ere they joined in the fray.
    Still a few drops within it lay;
    And round the sacred table glow
    Twelve lofty lamps, in splendid row,
    From the purest metal cast;
    A spoil--the richest, and the last.

                    XXXIII.

    So near they came, the nearest stretched
    To grasp the spoil he almost reached
      When old Minotti's hand
    Touched with the torch the train--
        'Tis fired!
    Spire, vaults, the shrine, the spoil, the slain,
      The turbaned victors, the Christian band,
    All that of living or dead remain,
    Hurled on high with the shivered fane,
        In one wild roar expired!
    The shattered town--the walls thrown down--
    The waves a moment backward bent--
    The hills that shake, although unrent,
      As if an Earthquake passed--
    The thousand shapeless things all driven
    In cloud and flame athwart the heaven,
      By that tremendous blast--
    Proclaimed the desperate conflict o'er
    On that too long afflicted shore:
    Up to the sky like rockets go
    All that mingled there below:
    Many a tall and goodly man,
    Scorched and shrivelled to a span,
    When he fell to earth again
    Like a cinder strewed the plain:
    Down the ashes shower like rain;
    Some fell in the gulf, which received the sprinkles
    With a thousand circling wrinkles;
    Some fell on the shore, but, far away,
    Scattered o'er the isthmus lay;
    Christian or Moslem, which be they?
    Let their mothers see and say!
    When in cradled rest they lay,
    And each nursing mother smiled
    On the sweet sleep of her child,
    Little deemed she such a day
    Would rend those tender limbs away.
    Not the matrons that them bore
    Could discern their offspring more;
    That one moment left no trace
    More of human form or face
    Save a scattered scalp or bone:
    And down came blazing rafters, strown
    Around, and many a falling stone,
    Deeply dinted in the clay,
    All blackened there and reeking lay.
    All the living things that heard
    The deadly earth-shock disappeared:
    The wild birds flew; the wild dogs fled,
    And howling left the unburied dead;
    The camels from their keepers broke;
    The distant steer forsook the yoke--
    The nearer steed plunged o'er the plain,
    And burst his girth, and tore his rein;
    The bull-frog's note, from out the marsh,
    Deep-mouthed arose, and doubly harsh;
    The wolves yelled on the caverned hill
    Where Echo rolled in thunder still;
    The jackal's troop, in gathered cry,
    Bayed from afar complainingly,
    With a mixed and mournful sound,
    Like crying babe, and beaten hound:
    With sudden wing, and ruffled breast,
    The eagle left his rocky nest,
    And mounted nearer to the sun,
    The clouds beneath him seemed so dun;
    Their smoke assailed his startled beak,
    And made him higher soar and shriek--
      Thus was Corinth lost and won!

                       PARISINA.

                    I.

    It is the hour when from the boughs
      The nightingale's high note is heard;
    It is the hour when lovers' vows
      Seem sweet in every whispered word;
    And gentle winds, and waters near,
    Make music to the lonely ear.
    Each flower the dews have lightly wet,
    And in the sky the stars are met,
    And on the wave is deeper blue,
    And on the leaf a browner hue,
    And in the heaven that clear obscure,
    So softly dark, and darkly pure,
    Which follows the decline of day,
    As twilight melts beneath the moon away.

                    II.

    But it is not to list to the waterfall
    That Parisina leaves her hall,
    And it is not to gaze on the heavenly light
    That the Lady walks in the shadow of night;
    And if she sits in Este's bower,
    'Tis not for the sake of its full-blown flower;
    She listens--but not for the nightingale--
    Though her ear expects as soft a tale.
    There glides a step through the foliage thick,
    And her cheek grows pale, and her heart beats quick.
    There whispers a voice through the rustling leaves,
    And her blush returns, and her bosom heaves:
    A moment more--and they shall meet--
    'Tis past--her Lover's at her feet.

                    III.

    And what unto them is the world beside,
    With all its change of time and tide?
    Its living things--its earth and sky--
    Are nothing to their mind and eye.
    And heedless as the dead are they
      Of aught around, above, beneath;
    As if all else had passed away,
      They only for each other breathe;
    Their very sighs are full of joy
      So deep, that did it not decay,
    That happy madness would destroy
      The hearts which feel its fiery sway:
    Of guilt, of peril, do they deem
    In that tumultuous tender dream?
    Who that have felt that passion's power,
    Or paused, or feared in such an hour?
    Or thought how brief such moments last?
    But yet--they are already past!
    Alas! we must awake before
    We know such vision comes no more.

                    IV.

    With many a lingering look they leave
      The spot of guilty gladness past:
    And though they hope, and vow, they grieve,
      As if that parting were the last.
    The frequent sigh--the long embrace--
      The lip that there would cling for ever,
    While gleams on Parisina's face
      The Heaven she fears will not forgive her,
    As if each calmly conscious star
    Beheld her frailty from afar--
    The frequent sigh, the long embrace,
    Yet binds them to their trysting-place.
    But it must come, and they must part
    In fearful heaviness of heart,
    With all the deep and shuddering chill
    Which follows fast the deeds of ill.

                    V.

    And Hugo is gone to his lonely bed,
      To covet there another's bride;
    But she must lay her conscious head
      A husband's trusting heart beside.
    But fevered in her sleep she seems,
    And red her cheek with troubled dreams,
      And mutters she in her unrest
    A name she dare not breathe by day,
      And clasps her Lord unto the breast
    Which pants for one away:
    And he to that embrace awakes,
    And, happy in the thought, mistakes
    That dreaming sigh, and warm caress,
    For such as he was wont to bless;
    And could in very fondness weep
    O'er her who loves him even in sleep.

                    VI.

    He clasped her sleeping to his heart,
      And listened to each broken word:
    He hears--Why doth Prince Azo start,
      As if the Archangel's voice he heard?
    And well he may--a deeper doom
    Could scarcely thunder o'er his tomb,
    When he shall wake to sleep no more,
    And stand the eternal throne before.
    And well he may--his earthly peace
    Upon that sound is doomed to cease.
    That sleeping whisper of a name
    Bespeaks her guilt and Azo's shame.
    And whose that name? that o'er his pillow
    Sounds fearful as the breaking billow,
    Which rolls the plank upon the shore,
      And dashes on the pointed rock
    The wretch who sinks to rise no more,--
      So came upon his soul the shock.
    And whose that name?--'tis Hugo's,--his--
    In sooth he had not deemed of this!--
    'Tis Hugo's,--he, the child of one
    He loved--his own all-evil son--
    The offspring of his wayward youth,
    When he betrayed Bianca's truth,
    The maid whose folly could confide
    In him who made her not his bride.

                    VII.

    He plucked his poniard in its sheath,
      But sheathed it ere the point was bare;
    Howe'er unworthy now to breathe,
      He could not slay a thing so fair--
      At least, not smiling--sleeping--there--
    Nay, more:--he did not wake her then,
      But gazed upon her with a glance
      Which, had she roused her from her trance,
    Had frozen her sense to sleep again;
    And o'er his brow the burning lamp
    Gleamed on the dew-drops big and damp.
    She spake no more--but still she slumbered--
    While, in his thought, her days are numbered.

                    VIII.

    And with the morn he sought and found,
    In many a tale from those around,
    The proof of all he feared to know,
    Their present guilt--his future woe;
    The long-conniving damsels seek
      To save themselves, and would transfer
      The guilt--the shame--the doom--to her:
    Concealment is no more--they speak
    All circumstance which may compel
    Full credence to the tale they tell:
    And Azo's tortured heart and ear
    Have nothing more to feel or hear.

                    IX.

    He was not one who brooked delay:
      Within the chamber of his state,
    The Chief of Este's ancient sway
      Upon his throne of judgement sate;
    His nobles and his guards are there,--
    Before him is the sinful pair;
    Both young,--and one how passing fair!
    With swordless belt, and fettered hand,
    Oh, Christ! that thus a son should stand
      Before a father's face!
    Yet thus must Hugo meet his sire,
    And hear the sentence of his ire,
      The tale of his disgrace!
    And yet he seems not overcome,
    Although, as yet, his voice be dumb.

                    X.

    And still,--and pale--and silently
      Did Parisina wait her doom;
    How changed since last her speaking eye
      Glanced gladness round the glittering room,
    Where high-born men were proud to wait--
    Where Beauty watched to imitate
      Her gentle voice--her lovely mien--
    And gather from her air and gait
      The graces of its Queen:
    Then,--had her eye in sorrow wept,
    A thousand warriors forth had leapt,
    A thousand swords had sheathless shone,
    And made her quarrel all their own.
    Now,--what is she? and what are they?
    Can she command, or these obey?
    All silent and unheeding now,
    With downcast eyes and knitting brow,
    And folded arms, and freezing air,
    And lips that scarce their scorn forbear,
    Her knights, her dames, her court--is there:
    And he--the chosen one, whose lance
    Had yet been couched before her glance,
    Who--were his arm a moment free--
    Had died or gained her liberty;
    The minion of his father's bride,--
    He, too, is fettered by her side;
    Nor sees her swoln and full eye swim
    Less for her own despair than him:
    Those lids--o'er which the violet vein
    Wandering, leaves a tender stain,
    Shining through the smoothest white
    That e'er did softest kiss invite--
    Now seemed with hot and livid glow
    To press, not shade, the orbs below;
    Which glance so heavily, and fill,
    As tear on tear grows gathering still

                    XI.

    And he for her had also wept,
      But for the eyes that on him gazed:
    His sorrow, if he felt it, slept;
      Stern and erect his brow was raised.
    Whate'er the grief his soul avowed,
    He would not shrink before the crowd;
    But yet he dared not look on her;
    Remembrance of the hours that were--
    His guilt--his love--his present state--
    His father's wrath, all good men's hate--
    His earthly, his eternal fate--
    And hers,--oh, hers! he dared not throw
    One look upon that death-like brow!
    Else had his rising heart betrayed
    Remorse for all the wreck it made.

                    XII.

    And Azo spake:--"But yesterday
      I gloried in a wife and son;
    That dream this morning passed away;
      Ere day declines, I shall have none.
    My life must linger on alone;
    Well,--let that pass,--there breathes not one
    Who would not do as I have done:
    Those ties are broken--not by me;
      Let that too pass;--the doom's prepared!
    Hugo, the priest awaits on thee,
      And then--thy crime's reward!
    Away! address thy prayers to Heaven.
      Before its evening stars are met,
    Learn if thou there canst be forgiven:
      Its mercy may absolve thee yet.
    But here, upon the earth beneath,
      There is no spot where thou and I
    Together for an hour could breathe:
      Farewell! I will not see thee die--
    But thou, frail thing! shall view his head--
      Away! I cannot speak the rest:
      Go! woman of the wanton breast;
    Not I, but thou his blood dost shed:
    Go! if that sight thou canst outlive,
    And joy thee in the life I give."

                    XIII.

    And here stern Azo hid his face--
      For on his brow the swelling vein
      Throbbed as if back upon his brain
      The hot blood ebbed and flowed again;
    And therefore bowed he for a space,
      And passed his shaking hand along
      His eye, to veil it from the throng;
    While Hugo raised his chained hands,
    And for a brief delay demands
    His father's ear: the silent sire
    Forbids not what his words require.
      "It is not that I dread the death--
    For thou hast seen me by thy side
    All redly through the battle ride,
    And that--not once a useless brand--
    Thy slaves have wrested from my hand
    Hath shed more blood in cause of thine,
    Than e'er can stain the axe of mine:
      Thou gav'st, and may'st resume my breath,
    A gift for which I thank thee not;
    Nor are my mother's wrongs forgot,
    Her slighted love and ruined name,
    Her offspring's heritage of shame;
    But she is in the grave, where he,
    Her son--thy rival--soon shall be.
    Her broken heart--my severed head--
    Shall witness for thee from the dead
    How trusty and how tender were
    Thy youthful love--paternal care.
    'Tis true that I have done thee wrong--
      But wrong for wrong:--this,--deemed thy bride,
      The other victim of thy pride,--
    Thou know'st for me was destined long;
    Thou saw'st, and coveted'st her charms;
      And with thy very crime--my birth,--
      Thou taunted'st me--as little worth;
    A match ignoble for her arms;
    Because, forsooth, I could not claim
    The lawful heirship of thy name,
    Nor sit on Este's lineal throne;
      Yet, were a few short summers mine,
      My name should more than Este's shine
    With honours all my own.
    I had a sword--and have a breast
    That should have won as haught a crest
    As ever waved along the line
    Of all these sovereign sires of thine.
    Not always knightly spurs are worn
    The brightest by the better born;
    And mine have lanced my courser's flank
    Before proud chiefs of princely rank,
    When charging to the cheering cry
    Of 'Este and of Victory!'
    I will not plead the cause of crime,
    Nor sue thee to redeem from time
    A few brief hours or days that must
    At length roll o'er my reckless dust;--
    Such maddening moments as my past,
    They could not, and they did not, last;--
    Albeit my birth and name be base,
    And thy nobility of race
    Disdained to deck a thing like me--
      Yet in my lineaments they trace
      Some features of my father's face,
    And in my spirit--all of thee.
    From thee this tamelessness of heart--
    From thee--nay, wherefore dost thou start?---
    From thee in all their vigour came
    My arm of strength, my soul of flame--
    Thou didst not give me life alone,
    But all that made me more thine own.
    See what thy guilty love hath done!
    Repaid thee with too like a son!
    I am no bastard in my soul,
    For that, like thine, abhorred control;
    And for my breath, that hasty boon
    Thou gav'st and wilt resume so soon,
    I valued it no more than thou,
    When rose thy casque above thy brow,
    And we, all side by side, have striven,
    And o'er the dead our coursers driven:
    The past is nothing--and at last
    The future can but be the past;
    Yet would I that I then had died:
      For though thou work'dst my mother's ill,
    And made thy own my destined bride,
      I feel thou art my father still:
    And harsh as sounds thy hard decree,
    'Tis not unjust, although from thee.
    Begot in sin, to die in shame,
    My life begun and ends the same:
    As erred the sire, so erred the son,
    And thou must punish both in one.
    My crime seems worst to human view,
    But God must judge between us too!"

                    XIV.

    He ceased--and stood with folded arms,
      On which the circling fetters sounded;
      And not an ear but felt as wounded,
      Of all the chiefs that there were ranked,
      When those dull chains in meeting clanked:
    Till Parisina's fatal charms
    Again attracted every eye--
    Would she thus hear him doomed to die!
    She stood, I said, all pale and still,
    The living cause of Hugo's ill:
    Her eyes unmoved, but full and wide,
    Not once had turned to either side--
    Nor once did those sweet eyelids close,
    Or shade the glance o'er which they rose,
    But round their orbs of deepest blue
    The circling white dilated grew--
    And there with glassy gaze she stood
    As ice were in her curdled blood;
    But every now and then a tear
      So large and slowly gathered slid
      From the long dark fringe of that fair lid,
    It was a thing to see, not hear!
    And those who saw, it did surprise,
    Such drops could fall from human eyes.
    To speak she thought--the imperfect note
    Was choked within her swelling throat,
    Yet seemed in that low hollow groan
    Her whole heart gushing in the tone.
    It ceased--again she thought to speak,
    Then burst her voice in one long shriek,
    And to the earth she fell like stone
    Or statue from its base o'erthrown,
    More like a thing that ne'er had life,--
    A monument of Azo's wife,--
    Than her, that living guilty thing,
    Whose every passion was a sting,
    Which urged to guilt, but could not bear
    That guilt's detection and despair.
    But yet she lived--and all too soon
    Recovered from that death-like swoon--
    But scarce to reason--every sense
    Had been o'erstrung by pangs intense;
    And each frail fibre of her brain
    (As bowstrings, when relaxed by rain,
    The erring arrow launch aside)
    Sent forth her thoughts all wild and wide--
    The past a blank, the future black,
    With glimpses of a dreary track,
    Like lightning on the desert path,
    When midnight storms are mustering wrath.
    She feared--she felt that something ill
    Lay on her soul, so deep and chill;
    That there was sin and shame she knew,
    That some one was to die--but who?
    She had forgotten:--did she breathe?
    Could this be still the earth beneath,
    The sky above, and men around;
    Or were they fiends who now so frowned
    On one, before whose eyes each eye
    Till then had smiled in sympathy?
    All was confused and undefined
    To her all-jarred and wandering mind;
    A chaos of wild hopes and fears:
    And now in laughter, now in tears,
    But madly still in each extreme,
    She strove with that convulsive dream;
    For so it seemed on her to break:
    Oh! vainly must she strive to wake!

                    XV.

    The Convent bells are ringing,
      But mournfully and slow;
    In the grey square turret swinging,
      With a deep sound, to and fro.
      Heavily to the heart they go!
    Hark! the hymn is singing--
      The song for the dead below,
      Or the living who shortly shall be so!
    For a departed being's soul
    The death-hymn peals and the hollow bells knoll:
    He is near his mortal goal;
    Kneeling at the Friar's knee,
    Sad to hear, and piteous to see--
    Kneeling on the bare cold ground.
    With the block before and the guards around;
    And the headsman with his bare arm ready,
    That the blow may be both swift and steady,
    Feels if the axe be sharp and true
    Since he set its edge anew:
    While the crowd in a speechless circle gather
    To see the Son fall by the doom of the Father!

                    XVI.

    It is a lovely hour as yet
    Before the summer sun shall set,
    Which rose upon that heavy day,
    And mock'd it with his steadiest ray;
    And his evening beams are shed
    Full on Hugo's fated head,
    As his last confession pouring
    To the monk, his doom deploring
    In penitential holiness,
    He bends to hear his accents bless
    With absolution such as may
    Wipe our mortal stains away.
    That high sun on his head did glisten
    As he there did bow and listen,
    And the rings of chestnut hair
    Curled half down his neck so bare;
    But brighter still the beam was thrown
    Upon the axe which near him shone
    With a clear and ghastly glitter----
    Oh! that parting hour was bitter!
    Even the stern stood chilled with awe:
    Dark the crime, and just the law--
    Yet they shuddered as they saw.

                    XVII.

    The parting prayers are said and over
    Of that false son, and daring lover!
    His beads and sins are all recounted,
    His hours to their last minute mounted;
    His mantling cloak before was stripped,
    His bright brown locks must now be clipped;
    'Tis done--all closely are they shorn;
    The vest which till this moment worn--
    The scarf which Parisina gave--
    Must not adorn him to the grave.
    Even that must now be thrown aside,
    And o'er his eyes the kerchief tied;
    But no--that last indignity
    Shall ne'er approach his haughty eye.
    All feelings seemingly subdued,
    In deep disdain were half renewed,
    When headsman's hands prepared to bind
    Those eyes which would not brook such blind,
    As if they dared not look on death.
    "No--yours my forfeit blood and breath;
    These hands are chained, but let me die
    At least with an unshackled eye--
    Strike:"--and as the word he said,
    Upon the block he bowed his head;
    These the last accents Hugo spoke:
    "Strike"--and flashing fell the stroke--
    Rolled the head--and, gushing, sunk
    Back the stained and heaving trunk,
    In the dust, which each deep vein
    Slaked with its ensanguined rain;
    His eyes and lips a moment quiver,
    Convulsed and quick--then fix for ever.

    He died, as erring man should die,
      Without display, without parade;
      Meekly had he bowed and prayed,
      As not disdaining priestly aid,
    Nor desperate of all hope on high.
    And while before the Prior kneeling,
    His heart was weaned from earthly feeling;
    His wrathful Sire--his Paramour--
    What were they in such an hour?
    No more reproach,--no more despair,--
    No thought but Heaven,--no word but prayer--
    Save the few which from him broke,
    When, bared to meet the headsman's stroke,
    He claimed to die with eyes unbound,
    His sole adieu to those around.

                    XVIII.

    Still as the lips that closed in death,
    Each gazer's bosom held his breath:
    But yet, afar, from man to man,
    A cold electric shiver ran,
    As down the deadly blow descended
    On him whose life and love thus ended;
    And, with a hushing sound compressed,
    A sigh shrunk back on every breast;
    But no more thrilling noise rose there,
      Beyond the blow that to the block
      Pierced through with forced and sullen shock,
    Save one:--what cleaves the silent air
    So madly shrill, so passing wild?
    That, as a mother's o'er her child,
    Done to death by sudden blow,
    To the sky these accents go,
    Like a soul's in endless woe.
    Through Azo's palace-lattice driven,
    That horrid voice ascends to heaven,
    And every eye is turned thereon;
    But sound and sight alike are gone!
    It was a woman's shriek--and ne'er
    In madlier accents rose despair;
    And those who heard it, as it past,
    In mercy wished it were the last.

                    XIX.

    Hugo is fallen; and, from that hour,
    No more in palace, hall, or bower,
    Was Parisina heard or seen:
    Her name--as if she ne'er had been--
    Was banished from each lip and ear,
    Like words of wantonness or fear;
    And from Prince Azo's voice, by none
    Was mention heard of wife or son;
    No tomb--no memory had they;
    Theirs was unconsecrated clay--
    At least the Knight's who died that day.
    But Parisina's fate lies hid
    Like dust beneath the coffin lid:
    Whether in convent she abode,
    And won to heaven her dreary road,
    By blighted and remorseful years
    Of scourge, and fast, and sleepless tears;
    Or if she fell by bowl or steel,
    For that dark love she dared to feel:
    Or if, upon the moment smote,
    She died by tortures less remote,
    Like him she saw upon the block
    With heart that shared the headsman's shock,
    In quickened brokenness that came,
    In pity o'er her shattered frame,
    None knew--and none can ever know:
    But whatsoe'er its end below,
    Her life began and closed in woe!

                    XX.

    And Azo found another bride,
    And goodly sons grew by his side;
    But none so lovely and so brave
    As him who withered in the grave;
    Or if they were--on his cold eye
    Their growth but glanced unheeded by,
    Or noticed with a smothered sigh.
    But never tear his cheek descended,
    And never smile his brow unbended;
    And o'er that fair broad brow were wrought
    The intersected lines of thought;
    Those furrows which the burning share
    Of Sorrow ploughs untimely there;
    Scars of the lacerating mind
    Which the Soul's war doth leave behind.
    He was past all mirth or woe:
    Nothing more remained below
    But sleepless nights and heavy days,
    A mind all dead to scorn or praise,
    A heart which shunned itself--and yet
    That would not yield, nor could forget,
    Which, when it least appeared to melt,
    Intensely thought--intensely felt:
    The deepest ice which ever froze
    Can only o'er the surface close;
    The living stream lies quick below,
    And flows, and cannot cease to flow.
    Still was his sealed-up bosom haunted
    By thoughts which Nature hath implanted;
    Too deeply rooted thence to vanish,
    Howe'er our stifled tears we banish;
    When struggling as they rise to start,
    We check those waters of the heart,
    They are not dried--those tears unshed
    But flow back to the fountain head,
    And resting in their spring more pure,
    For ever in its depth endure,
    Unseen--unwept--but uncongealed,
    And cherished most where least revealed.
    With inward starts of feeling left,
    To throb o'er those of life bereft,
    Without the power to fill again
    The desert gap which made his pain;
    Without the hope to meet them where
    United souls shall gladness share;
    With all the consciousness that he
    Had only passed a just decree;
    That they had wrought their doom of ill;
    Yet Azo's age was wretched still.
    The tainted branches of the tree,
      If lopped with care, a strength may give,
      By which the rest shall bloom and live
    All greenly fresh and wildly free:
    But if the lightning, in its wrath,
    The waving boughs with fury scathe,
    The massy trunk the ruin feels,
    And never more a leaf reveals.

                         POEMS OF THE SEPARATION

                    FARE THEE WELL.

           "Alas! they had been friends in youth;
           But whispering tongues can poison truth:
           And Constancy lives in realms above;
           And Life is thorny; and youth is vain:
           And to be wroth with one we love,
           Doth work like madness in the brain;

           But never either found another
           To free the hollow heart from paining--
           They stood aloof, the scars remaining,
           Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;
           A dreary sea now flows between,
           But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,
           Shall wholly do away, I ween,
           The marks of that which once hath been."
                                      Coleridge's Christabel.

    Fare thee well! and if for ever,
      Still for ever, fare thee well:
    Even though unforgiving, never
      'Gainst thee shall my heart rebel.
    Would that breast were bared before thee
      Where thy head so oft hath lain,
    While that placid sleep came o'er thee
      Which thou ne'er canst know again:
    Would that breast, by thee glanced over,
      Every inmost thought could show!
    Then thou would'st at last discover
      'Twas not well to spurn it so.
    Though the world for this commend thee--
      Though it smile upon the blow,
    Even its praises must offend thee,
      Founded on another's woe:
    Though my many faults defaced me,
      Could no other arm be found,
    Than the one which once embraced me,
      To inflict a cureless wound?
    Yet, oh yet, thyself deceive not--
      Love may sink by slow decay,
    But by sudden wrench, believe not
      Hearts can thus be torn away:
    Still thine own its life retaineth--
      Still must mine, though bleeding, beat;
    And the undying thought which paineth
      Is--that we no more may meet.
    These are words of deeper sorrow
      Than the wail above the dead;
    Both shall live--but every morrow
      Wake us from a widowed bed.
    And when thou would'st solace gather--
      When our child's first accents flow--
    Wilt thou teach her to say "Father!"
      Though his care she must forego?
    When her little hands shall press thee--
      When her lip to thine is pressed--
    Think of him whose prayer shall bless thee--
      Think of him thy love had blessed!
    Should her lineaments resemble
      Those thou never more may'st see,
    Then thy heart will softly tremble
      With a pulse yet true to me.
    All my faults perchance thou knowest--
      All my madness--none can know;
    All my hopes--where'er thou goest--
      Wither--yet with thee they go.
    Every feeling hath been shaken;
      Pride--which not a world could bow--
    Bows to thee--by thee forsaken,
      Even my soul forsakes me now.
    But 'tis done--all words are idle--
      Words from me are vainer still;
    But the thoughts we cannot bridle
      Force their way without the will.
    Fare thee well! thus disunited--
      Torn from every nearer tie--
    Seared in heart--and lone--and blighted--
      More than this I scarce can die.
                                         
                     A SKETCH.

             "Honest--honest Iago!
              If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee."
                                                 Shakespeare.

    Born in the garret, in the kitchen bred,
    Promoted thence to deck her mistress' head;
    Next--for some gracious service unexpressed,
    And from its wages only to be guessed--
    Raised from the toilet to the table,--where
    Her wondering betters wait behind her chair.
    With eye unmoved, and forehead unabashed,
    She dines from off the plate she lately washed.
    Quick with the tale, and ready with the lie,
    The genial confidante, and general spy--
    Who could, ye gods! her next employment guess--
    An only infant's earliest governess!
    She taught the child to read, and taught so well,
    That she herself, by teaching, learned to spell.
    An adept next in penmanship she grows,
    As many a nameless slander deftly shows:
    What she had made the pupil of her art,
    None know--but that high Soul secured the heart,
    And panted for the truth it could not hear,
    With longing breast and undeluded ear.
    Foiled was perversion by that youthful mind,
    Which Flattery fooled not, Baseness could not blind,
    Deceit infect not, near Contagion soil,
    Indulgence weaken, nor Example spoil,
    Nor mastered Science tempt her to look down
    On humbler talents with a pitying frown,
    Nor Genius swell, nor Beauty render vain,
    Nor Envy ruffle to retaliate pain,
    Nor Fortune change, Pride raise, nor Passion bow,
    Nor Virtue teach austerity--till now.
    Serenely purest of her sex that live,
    But wanting one sweet weakness--to forgive;
    Too shocked at faults her soul can never know,
    She deems that all could be like her below:
    Foe to all vice, yet hardly Virtue's friend,
    For Virtue pardons those she would amend.

    But to the theme, now laid aside too long,
    The baleful burthen of this honest song,
    Though all her former functions are no more,
    She rules the circle which she served before.
    If mothers--none know why--before her quake;
    If daughters dread her for the mothers' sake;
    If early habits--those false links, which bind
    At times the loftiest to the meanest mind--
    Have given her power too deeply to instil
    The angry essence of her deadly will;
    If like a snake she steal within your walls,
    Till the black slime betray her as she crawls;
    If like a viper to the heart she wind,
    And leave the venom there she did not find;
    What marvel that this hag of hatred works
    Eternal evil latent as she lurks,
    To make a Pandemonium where she dwells,
    And reign the Hecate of domestic hells?
    Skilled by a touch to deepen Scandal's tints
    With all the kind mendacity of hints,
    While mingling truth with falsehood--sneers with smiles--
    A thread of candour with a web of wiles;
    A plain blunt show of briefly-spoken seeming,
    To hide her bloodless heart's soul-hardened scheming;
    A lip of lies; a face formed to conceal,
    And, without feeling, mock at all who feel:
    With a vile mask the Gorgon would disown,--
    A cheek of parchment, and an eye of stone.
    Mark, how the channels of her yellow blood
    Ooze to her skin, and stagnate there to mud,
    Cased like the centipede in saffron mail,
    Or darker greenness of the scorpion's scale--
    (For drawn from reptiles only may we trace
    Congenial colours in that soul or face)--
    Look on her features! and behold her mind
    As in a mirror of itself defined:
    Look on the picture! deem it not o'ercharged--
    There is no trait which might not be enlarged:
    Yet true to "Nature's journeymen," who made
    This monster when their mistress left off trade--
    This female dog-star of her little sky,
    Where all beneath her influence droop or die.

    Oh! wretch without a tear--without a thought,
    Save joy above the ruin thou hast wrought--
    The time shall come, nor long remote, when thou
    Shalt feel far more than thou inflictest now;
    Feel for thy vile self-loving self in vain,
    And turn thee howling in unpitied pain.
    May the strong curse of crushed affections light
    Back on thy bosom with reflected blight!
    And make thee in thy leprosy of mind
    As loathsome to thyself as to mankind!
    Till all thy self-thoughts curdle into hate,
    Black--as thy will or others would create:
    Till thy hard heart be calcined into dust,
    And thy soul welter in its hideous crust.
    Oh, may thy grave be sleepless as the bed,
    The widowed couch of fire, that thou hast spread!
    Then, when thou fain wouldst weary Heaven with prayer,
    Look on thine earthly victims--and despair!
    Down to the dust!--and, as thou rott'st away,
    Even worms shall perish on thy poisonous clay.
    But for the love I bore, and still must bear,
    To her thy malice from all ties would tear--
    Thy name--thy human name--to every eye
    The climax of all scorn should hang on high,
    Exalted o'er thy less abhorred compeers--
    And festering in the infamy of years.
                                          
                  STANZAS TO AUGUSTA.

    When all around grew drear and dark,
      And reason half withheld her ray--
    And Hope but shed a dying spark
      Which more misled my lonely way;
    In that deep midnight of the mind,
      And that internal strife of heart,
    When dreading to be deemed too kind,
      The weak despair--the cold depart;
    When Fortune changed--and Love fled far,
      And Hatred's shafts flew thick and fast,
    Thou wert the solitary star
      Which rose and set not to the last.
    Oh! blest be thine unbroken light!
      That watched me as a Seraph's eye,
    And stood between me and the night,
      For ever shining sweetly nigh.
    And when the cloud upon us came,
      Which strove to blacken o'er thy ray--
    Then purer spread its gentle flame,
      And dashed the darkness all away.
    Still may thy Spirit dwell on mine,
      And teach it what to brave or brook--
    There's more in one soft word of thine
      Than in the world's defied rebuke.
    Thou stood'st, as stands a lovely tree,
      That still unbroke, though gently bent,
    Still waves with fond fidelity
      Its boughs above a monument.
    The winds might rend--the skies might pour,
      But there thou wert--and still wouldst be
    Devoted in the stormiest hour
      To shed thy weeping leaves o'er me.
    But thou and thine shall know no blight,
      Whatever fate on me may fall;
    For Heaven in sunshine will requite
      The kind--and thee the most of all.
    Then let the ties of baffled love
      Be broken--thine will never break;
    Thy heart can feel--but will not move;
      Thy soul, though soft, will never shake.
    And these, when all was lost beside,
      Were found and still are fixed in thee:--
    And bearing still a breast so tried,
      Earth is no desert--ev'n to me.
               
                          THE PRISONER OF CHILLON

                            SONNET ON CHILLON

    Eternal Spirit of the chainless Mind!
      Brightest in dungeons, Liberty! thou art:
      For there thy habitation is the heart--
    The heart which love of thee alone can bind;
    And when thy sons to fetters are consigned--
      To fetters, and the damp vault's dayless gloom,
      Their country conquers with their martyrdom,
    And Freedom's fame finds wings on every wind.
    Chillon! thy prison is a holy place,
      And thy sad floor an altar--for 'twas trod,
    Until his very steps have left a trace
      Worn, as if thy cold pavement were a sod,
    By Bonnivard!--May none those marks efface!
      For they appeal from tyranny to God.

                         THE PRISONER OF CHILLON

                        I.

    My hair is grey, but not with years,
    Nor grew it white
        In a single night,
    As men's have grown from sudden fears:
    My limbs are bowed, though not with toil,
      But rusted with a vile repose,
    For they have been a dungeon's spoil,
      And mine has been the fate of those
    To whom the goodly earth and air
    Are banned, and barred--forbidden fare;
    But this was for my father's faith
    I suffered chains and courted death;
    That father perished at the stake
    For tenets he would not forsake;
    And for the same his lineal race
    In darkness found a dwelling place;
    We were seven--who now are one,
      Six in youth, and one in age,
    Finished as they had begun,
      Proud of Persecution's rage;
    One in fire, and two in field,
    Their belief with blood have sealed,
    Dying as their father died,
    For the God their foes denied;--
    Three were in a dungeon cast,
    Of whom this wreck is left the last.

                        II.

    There are seven pillars of Gothic mould,
    In Chillon's dungeons deep and old,
    There are seven columns, massy and grey,
    Dim with a dull imprisoned ray,
    A sunbeam which hath lost its way,
    And through the crevice and the cleft
    Of the thick wall is fallen and left;
    Creeping o'er the floor so damp,
    Like a marsh's meteor lamp:
    And in each pillar there is a ring,
      And in each ring there is a chain;
    That iron is a cankering thing,
      For in these limbs its teeth remain,
    With marks that will not wear away,
    Till I have done with this new day,
    Which now is painful to these eyes,
    Which have not seen the sun so rise
    For years--I cannot count them o'er,
    I lost their long and heavy score
    When my last brother drooped and died,
    And I lay living by his side.

                        III.

    They chained us each to a column stone,
    And we were three--yet, each alone;
    We could not move a single pace,
    We could not see each other's face,
    But with that pale and livid light
    That made us strangers in our sight:
    And thus together--yet apart,
    Fettered in hand, but joined in heart,
    'Twas still some solace in the dearth
    Of the pure elements of earth,
    To hearken to each other's speech,
    And each turn comforter to each
    With some new hope, or legend old,
    Or song heroically bold;
    But even these at length grew cold.
    Our voices took a dreary tone,
    An echo of the dungeon stone,
        A grating sound, not full and free,
        As they of yore were wont to be:
        It might be fancy--but to me
    They never sounded like our own.

                        IV.

    I was the eldest of the three,
      And to uphold and cheer the rest
      I ought to do--and did my best--
    And each did well in his degree.
      The youngest, whom my father loved,
    Because our mother's brow was given
    To him, with eyes as blue as heaven--
      For him my soul was sorely moved:
    And truly might it be distressed
    To see such bird in such a nest;
    For he was beautiful as day--
      (When day was beautiful to me
      As to young eagles, being free)--
      A polar day, which will not see
    A sunset till its summer's gone,
      Its sleepless summer of long light,
    The snow-clad offspring of the sun:
      And thus he was as pure and bright,
    And in his natural spirit gay,
    With tears for nought but others' ills,
    And then they flowed like mountain rills,
    Unless he could assuage the woe
    Which he abhorred to view below.

                        V.

    The other was as pure of mind,
    But formed to combat with his kind;
    Strong in his frame, and of a mood
    Which 'gainst the world in war had stood,
    And perished in the foremost rank
      With joy:--but not in chains to pine:
    His spirit withered with their clank,
      I saw it silently decline--
      And so perchance in sooth did mine:
    But yet I forced it on to cheer
    Those relics of a home so dear.
    He was a hunter of the hills,
      Had followed there the deer and wolf;
      To him this dungeon was a gulf,
    And fettered feet the worst of ills.

                        VI.

      Lake Leman lies by Chillon's walls:
    A thousand feet in depth below
    Its massy waters meet and flow;
    Thus much the fathom-line was sent
    From Chillon's snow-white battlement,
      Which round about the wave inthralls:
    A double dungeon wall and wave
    Have made--and like a living grave.
    Below the surface of the lake
    The dark vault lies wherein we lay:
    We heard it ripple night and day;
      Sounding o'er our heads it knocked;
    And I have felt the winter's spray
    Wash through the bars when winds were high
    And wanton in the happy sky;
      And then the very rock hath rocked,
      And I have felt it shake, unshocked,
    Because I could have smiled to see
    The death that would have set me free.

                        VII.

    I said my nearer brother pined,
    I said his mighty heart declined,
    He loathed and put away his food;
    It was not that 'twas coarse and rude,
    For we were used to hunter's fare,
    And for the like had little care:
    The milk drawn from the mountain goat
    Was changed for water from the moat,
    Our bread was such as captives' tears
    Have moistened many a thousand years,
    Since man first pent his fellow men
    Like brutes within an iron den;
    But what were these to us or him?
    These wasted not his heart or limb;
    My brother's soul was of that mould
    Which in a palace had grown cold,
    Had his free breathing been denied
    The range of the steep mountain's side;
    But why delay the truth?--he died.
    I saw, and could not hold his head,
    Nor reach his dying hand--nor dead,--
    Though hard I strove, but strove in vain,
    To rend and gnash my bonds in twain.
    He died--and they unlocked his chain,
    And scooped for him a shallow grave
    Even from the cold earth of our cave.
    I begged them, as a boon, to lay
    His corse in dust whereon the day
    Might shine--it was a foolish thought,
    But then within my brain it wrought,
    That even in death his freeborn breast
    In such a dungeon could not rest.
    I might have spared my idle prayer--
    They coldly laughed--and laid him there:
    The flat and turfless earth above
    The being we so much did love;
    His empty chain above it leant,
    Such Murder's fitting monument!

                        VIII.

    But he, the favourite and the flower,
    Most cherished since his natal hour,
    His mother's image in fair face,
    The infant love of all his race,
    His martyred father's dearest thought,
    My latest care, for whom I sought
    To hoard my life, that his might be
    Less wretched now, and one day free;
    He, too, who yet had held untired
    A spirit natural or inspired--
    He, too, was struck, and day by day
    Was withered on the stalk away.
    Oh, God! it is a fearful thing
    To see the human soul take wing
    In any shape, in any mood:
    I've seen it rushing forth in blood,
    I've seen it on the breaking ocean
    Strive with a swoln convulsive motion,
    I've seen the sick and ghastly bed
    Of Sin delirious with its dread:
    But these were horrors--this was woe
    Unmixed with such--but sure and slow:
    He faded, and so calm and meek,
    So softly worn, so sweetly weak,
    So tearless, yet so tender--kind,
    And grieved for those he left behind;
    With all the while a cheek whose bloom
    Was as a mockery of the tomb,
    Whose tints as gently sunk away
    As a departing rainbow's ray;
    An eye of most transparent light,
    That almost made the dungeon bright;
    And not a word of murmur--not
    A groan o'er his untimely lot,--
    A little talk of better days,
    A little hope my own to raise,
    For I was sunk in silence--lost
    In this last loss, of all the most;
    And then the sighs he would suppress
    Of fainting Nature's feebleness,
    More slowly drawn, grew less and less:
    I listened, but I could not hear;
    I called, for I was wild with fear;
    I knew 'twas hopeless, but my dread
    Would not be thus admonished;
    I called, and thought I heard a sound--
    I burst my chain with one strong bound,
    And rushed to him:--I found him not,
    I only stirred in this black spot,
    I only lived, I only drew
    The accursed breath of dungeon-dew;
    The last, the sole, the dearest link
    Between me and the eternal brink,
    Which bound me to my failing race,
    Was broken in this fatal place.
    One on the earth, and one beneath--
    My brothers--both had ceased to breathe:
    I took that hand which lay so still,
    Alas! my own was full as chill;
    I had not strength to stir, or strive,
    But felt that I was still alive--
    A frantic feeling, when we know
    That what we love shall ne'er be so.
        I know not why
        I could not die,
    I had no earthly hope--but faith,
    And that forbade a selfish death.

                        IX.

    What next befell me then and there
      I know not well--I never knew--
    First came the loss of light, and air,
      And then of darkness too:
    I had no thought, no feeling--none--
    Among the stones I stood a stone,
    And was, scarce conscious what I wist,
    As shrubless crags within the mist;
    For all was blank, and bleak, and grey;
    It was not night--it was not day;
    It was not even the dungeon-light,
    So hateful to my heavy sight,
    But vacancy absorbing space,
    And fixedness--without a place;
    There were no stars--no earth--no time--
    No check--no change--no good--no crime--
    But silence, and a stirless breath
    Which neither was of life nor death;
    A sea of stagnant idleness,
    Blind, boundless, mute, and motionless!

                        X.

    A light broke in upon my brain,--
      It was the carol of a bird;
    It ceased, and then it came again,
      The sweetest song ear ever heard,
    And mine was thankful till my eyes
    Ran over with the glad surprise,
    And they that moment could not see
    I was the mate of misery;
    But then by dull degrees came back
    My senses to their wonted track;
    I saw the dungeon walls and floor
    Close slowly round me as before,
    I saw the glimmer of the sun
    Creeping as it before had done,
    But through the crevice where it came
    That bird was perched, as fond and tame,
      And tamer than upon the tree;
    A lovely bird, with azure wings,
    And song that said a thousand things,
      And seemed to say them all for me!
    I never saw its like before,
    I ne'er shall see its likeness more:
    It seemed like me to want a mate,
    But was not half so desolate,
    And it was come to love me when
    None lived to love me so again,
    And cheering from my dungeon's brink,
    Had brought me back to feel and think.
    I know not if it late were free,
      Or broke its cage to perch on mine,
    But knowing well captivity,
      Sweet bird! I could not wish for thine!
    Or if it were, in winged guise,
    A visitant from Paradise;
    For--Heaven forgive that thought! the while
    Which made me both to weep and smile--
    I sometimes deemed that it might be
    My brother's soul come down to me;
    But then at last away it flew,
    And then 'twas mortal well I knew,
    For he would never thus have flown--
    And left me twice so doubly lone,--
    Lone--as the corse within its shroud,
    Lone--as a solitary cloud,
      A single cloud on a sunny day,
    While all the rest of heaven is clear,
    A frown upon the atmosphere,
    That hath no business to appear
      When skies are blue, and earth is gay.

                        XI.

    A kind of change came in my fate,
    My keepers grew compassionate;
    I know not what had made them so,
    They were inured to sights of woe,
    But so it was:--my broken chain
    With links unfastened did remain,
    And it was liberty to stride
    Along my cell from side to side,
    And up and down, and then athwart,
    And tread it over every part;
    And round the pillars one by one,
    Returning where my walk begun,
    Avoiding only, as I trod,
    My brothers' graves without a sod;
    For if I thought with heedless tread
    My step profaned their lowly bed,
    My breath came gaspingly and thick,
    And my crushed heart felt blind and sick.

                        XII.

    I made a footing in the wall,
      It was not therefrom to escape,
    For I had buried one and all,
      Who loved me in a human shape;
    And the whole earth would henceforth be
    A wider prison unto me:
    No child--no sire--no kin had I,
    No partner in my misery;
    I thought of this, and I was glad,
    For thought of them had made me mad;
    But I was curious to ascend
    To my barred windows, and to bend
    Once more, upon the mountains high,
    The quiet of a loving eye.

                        XIII.

    I saw them--and they were the same,
    They were not changed like me in frame;
    I saw their thousand years of snow
    On high--their wide long lake below,
    And the blue Rhone in fullest flow;
    I heard the torrents leap and gush
    O'er channelled rock and broken bush;
    I saw the white-walled distant town,
    And whiter sails go skimming down;
    And then there was a little isle,
    Which in my very face did smile,
      The only one in view;
    A small green isle, it seemed no more,
    Scarce broader than my dungeon floor,
    But in it there were three tall trees,
    And o'er it blew the mountain breeze,
    And by it there were waters flowing,
    And on it there were young flowers growing,
      Of gentle breath and hue.
    The fish swam by the castle wall,
    And they seemed joyous each and all;
    The eagle rode the rising blast,
    Methought he never flew so fast
    As then to me he seemed to fly;
    And then new tears came in my eye,
    And I felt troubled--and would fain
    I had not left my recent chain;
    And when I did descend again,
    The darkness of my dim abode
    Fell on me as a heavy load;
    It was as is a new-dug grave,
    Closing o'er one we sought to save,--
    And yet my glance, too much opprest,
    Had almost need of such a rest.

                        XIV.

    It might be months, or years, or days--
      I kept no count, I took no note--
    I had no hope my eyes to raise,
      And clear them of their dreary mote;
    At last men came to set me free;
      I asked not why, and recked not where;
    It was at length the same to me,
    Fettered or fetterless to be,
      I learned to love despair.
    And thus when they appeared at last,
    And all my bonds aside were cast,
    These heavy walls to me had grown
    A hermitage--and all my own!
    And half I felt as they were come
    To tear me from a second home:
    With spiders I had friendship made,
    And watched them in their sullen trade,
    Had seen the mice by moonlight play,
    And why should I feel less than they?
    We were all inmates of one place,
    And I, the monarch of each race,
    Had power to kill--yet, strange to tell!
    In quiet we had learned to dwell;
    My very chains and I grew friends,
    So much a long communion tends
    To make us what we are:--even I
    Regained my freedom with a sigh.
                    
                                THE DREAM

                        I.

    Our life is twofold: Sleep hath its own world,
    A boundary between the things misnamed
    Death and existence: Sleep hath its own world,
    And a wide realm of wild reality,
    And dreams in their developement have breath,
    And tears, and tortures, and the touch of Joy;
    They leave a weight upon our waking thoughts,
    They take a weight from off our waking toils,
    They do divide our being; they become
    A portion of ourselves as of our time,
    And look like heralds of Eternity;
    They pass like spirits of the past,--they speak
    Like Sibyls of the future; they have power--
    The tyranny of pleasure and of pain;
    They make us what we were not--what they will,
    And shake us with the vision that's gone by,
    The dread of vanished shadows--Are they so?
    Is not the past all shadow?--What are they?
    Creations of the mind?--The mind can make
    Substance, and people planets of its own
    With beings brighter than have been, and give
    A breath to forms which can outlive all flesh.
    I would recall a vision which I dreamed
    Perchance in sleep--for in itself a thought,
    A slumbering thought, is capable of years,
    And curdles a long life into one hour.

                        II.

    I saw two beings in the hues of youth
    Standing upon a hill, a gentle hill,
    Green and of mild declivity, the last
    As 'twere the cape of a long ridge of such,
    Save that there was no sea to lave its base,
    But a most living landscape, and the wave
    Of woods and cornfields, and the abodes of men
    Scattered at intervals, and wreathing smoke
    Arising from such rustic roofs;--the hill
    Was crowned with a peculiar diadem
    Of trees, in circular array, so fixed,
    Not by the sport of nature, but of man:
    These two, a maiden and a youth, were there
    Gazing--the one on all that was beneath
    Fair as herself--but the Boy gazed on her;
    And both were young, and one was beautiful:
    And both were young--yet not alike in youth.
    As the sweet moon on the horizon's verge,
    The Maid was on the eve of Womanhood;
    The Boy had fewer summers, but his heart
    Had far outgrown his years, and to his eye
    There was but one beloved face on earth,
    And that was shining on him: he had looked
    Upon it till it could not pass away;
    He had no breath, no being, but in hers;
    She was his voice; he did not speak to her,
    But trembled on her words; she was his sight,
    For his eye followed hers, and saw with hers,
    Which coloured all his objects:--he had ceased
    To live within himself; she was his life,
    The ocean to the river of his thoughts,
    Which terminated all: upon a tone,
    A touch of hers, his blood would ebb and flow,
    And his cheek change tempestuously--his heart
    Unknowing of its cause of agony.
    But she in these fond feelings had no share:
    Her sighs were not for him; to her he was
    Even as a brother--but no more; 'twas much,
    For brotherless she was, save in the name
    Her infant friendship had bestowed on him;
    Herself the solitary scion left
    Of a time-honoured race.--It was a name
    Which pleased him, and yet pleased him not--and why?
    Time taught him a deep answer--when she loved
    Another: even now she loved another,
    And on the summit of that hill she stood
    Looking afar if yet her lover's steed
    Kept pace with her expectancy, and flew.

                        III.

    A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
    There was an ancient mansion, and before
    Its walls there was a steed caparisoned:
    Within an antique Oratory stood
    The Boy of whom I spake;--he was alone,
    And pale, and pacing to and fro: anon
    He sate him down, and seized a pen, and traced
    Words which I could not guess of; then he leaned
    His bowed head on his hands, and shook as 'twere
    With a convulsion--then arose again,
    And with his teeth and quivering hands did tear
    What he had written, but he shed no tears.
    And he did calm himself, and fix his brow
    Into a kind of quiet: as he paused,
    The Lady of his love re-entered there;
    She was serene and smiling then, and yet
    She knew she was by him beloved--she knew,
    For quickly comes such knowledge, that his heart
    Was darkened with her shadow, and she saw
    That he was wretched, but she saw not all.
    He rose, and with a cold and gentle grasp
    He took her hand; a moment o'er his face
    A tablet of unutterable thoughts
    Was traced, and then it faded, as it came;
    He dropped the hand he held, and with slow steps
    Retired, but not as bidding her adieu,
    For they did part with mutual smiles; he passed
    From out the massy gate of that old Hall,
    And mounting on his steed he went his way;
    And ne'er repassed that hoary threshold more.

                        IV.

    A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
    The Boy was sprung to manhood: in the wilds
    Of fiery climes he made himself a home,
    And his Soul drank their sunbeams: he was girt
    With strange and dusky aspects; he was not
    Himself like what he had been; on the sea
    And on the shore he was a wanderer;
    There was a mass of many images
    Crowded like waves upon me, but he was
    A part of all; and in the last he lay
    Reposing from the noontide sultriness,
    Couched among fallen columns, in the shade
    Of ruined walls that had survived the names
    Of those who reared them; by his sleeping side
    Stood camels grazing, and some goodly steeds
    Were fastened near a fountain; and a man
    Clad in a flowing garb did watch the while,
    While many of his tribe slumbered around:
    And they were canopied by the blue sky,
    So cloudless, clear, and purely beautiful,
    That God alone was to be seen in Heaven.

                        V.

    A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
    The Lady of his love was wed with One
    Who did not love her better:--in her home,
    A thousand leagues from his,--her native home,
    She dwelt, begirt with growing Infancy,
    Daughters and sons of Beauty,--but behold!
    Upon her face there was the tint of grief,
    The settled shadow of an inward strife,
    And an unquiet drooping of the eye,
    As if its lid were charged with unshed tears.
    What could her grief be?--she had all she loved,
    And he who had so loved her was not there
    To trouble with bad hopes, or evil wish,
    Or ill-repressed affliction, her pure thoughts.
    What could her grief be?--she had loved him not,
    Nor given him cause to deem himself beloved,
    Nor could he be a part of that which preyed
    Upon her mind--a spectre of the past.

                        VI.

    A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
    The Wanderer was returned.--I saw him stand
    Before an Altar--with a gentle bride;
    Her face was fair, but was not that which made
    The Starlight of his Boyhood;--as he stood
    Even at the altar, o'er his brow there came
    The self-same aspect, and the quivering shock
    That in the antique Oratory shook
    His bosom in its solitude; and then--
    As in that hour--a moment o'er his face
    The tablet of unutterable thoughts
    Was traced,--and then it faded as it came,
    And he stood calm and quiet, and he spoke
    The fitting vows, but heard not his own words,
    And all things reeled around him; he could see
    Not that which was, nor that which should have been--
    But the old mansion, and the accustomed hall,
    And the remembered chambers, and the place,
    The day, the hour, the sunshine, and the shade,
    All things pertaining to that place and hour
    And her who was his destiny, came back
    And thrust themselves between him and the light:
    What business had they there at such a time?

                        VII.

    A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
    The Lady of his love;--Oh! she was changed
    As by the sickness of the soul; her mind
    Had wandered from its dwelling, and her eyes
    They had not their own lustre, but the look
    Which is not of the earth; she was become
    The Queen of a fantastic realm; her thoughts
    Were combinations of disjointed things;
    And forms, impalpable and unperceived
    Of others' sight, familiar were to hers.
    And this the world calls frenzy; but the wise
    Have a far deeper madness--and the glance
    Of melancholy is a fearful gift;
    What is it but the telescope of truth?
    Which strips the distance of its fantasies,
    And brings life near in utter nakedness,
    Making the cold reality too real!

                        VIII.

    A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
    The Wanderer was alone as heretofore,
    The beings which surrounded him were gone,
    Or were at war with him; he was a mark
    For blight and desolation, compassed round
    With Hatred and Contention; Pain was mixed
    In all which was served up to him, until,
    Like to the Pontic monarch of old days,
    He fed on poisons, and they had no power,
    But were a kind of nutriment; he lived
    Through that which had been death to many men,
    And made him friends of mountains: with the stars
    And the quick Spirit of the Universe
    He held his dialogues; and they did teach
    To him the magic of their mysteries;
    To him the book of Night was opened wide,
    And voices from the deep abyss revealed
    A marvel and a secret--Be it so.

                        IX.

    My dream was past; it had no further change.
    It was of a strange order, that the doom
    Of these two creatures should be thus traced out
    Almost like a reality--the one
    To end in madness--both in misery.

                             DARKNESS.

    I had a dream, which was not all a dream.
    The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars
    Did wander darkling in the eternal space,
    Rayless, and pathless, and the icy Earth
    Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;
    Morn came and went--and came, and brought no day,
    And men forgot their passions in the dread
    Of this their desolation; and all hearts
    Were chilled into a selfish prayer for light:
    And they did live by watchfires--and the thrones,
    The palaces of crowned kings--the huts,
    The habitations of all things which dwell,
    Were burnt for beacons; cities were consumed,
    And men were gathered round their blazing homes
    To look once more into each other's face;
    Happy were those who dwelt within the eye
    Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch:
    A fearful hope was all the World contained;
    Forests were set on fire--but hour by hour
    They fell and faded--and the crackling trunks
    Extinguished with a crash--and all was black.
    The brows of men by the despairing light
    Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits
    The flashes fell upon them; some lay down
    And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest
    Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smiled;
    And others hurried to and fro, and fed
    Their funeral piles with fuel, and looked up
    With mad disquietude on the dull sky,
    The pall of a past World; and then again
    With curses cast them down upon the dust,
    And gnashed their teeth and howled: the wild birds shrieked,
    And, terrified, did flutter on the ground,
    And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes
    Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawled
    And twined themselves among the multitude,
    Hissing, but stingless--they were slain for food:
    And War, which for a moment was no more,
    Did glut himself again:--a meal was bought
    With blood, and each sate sullenly apart
    Gorging himself in gloom: no Love was left;
    All earth was but one thought--and that was Death,
    Immediate and inglorious; and the pang
    Of famine fed upon all entrails--men
    Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;
    The meagre by the meagre were devoured,
    Even dogs assailed their masters, all save one,
    And he was faithful to a corse, and kept
    The birds and beasts and famished men at bay,
    Till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead
    Lured their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,
    But with a piteous and perpetual moan,
    And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand
    Which answered not with a caress--he died.
    The crowd was famished by degrees; but two
    Of an enormous city did survive,
    And they were enemies: they met beside
    The dying embers of an altar-place
    Where had been heaped a mass of holy things
    For an unholy usage; they raked up,
    And shivering scraped with their cold skeleton hands
    The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath
    Blew for a little life, and made a flame
    Which was a mockery; then they lifted up
    Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld
    Each other's aspects--saw, and shrieked, and died--
    Even of their mutual hideousness they died,
    Unknowing who he was upon whose brow
    Famine had written Fiend. The World was void,
    The populous and the powerful was a lump,
    Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless--
    A lump of death--a chaos of hard clay.
    The rivers, lakes, and ocean all stood still,
    And nothing stirred within their silent depths;
    Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea,
    And their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropped
    They slept on the abyss without a surge--
    The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,
    The Moon, their mistress, had expired before;
    The winds were withered in the stagnant air,
    And the clouds perished; Darkness had no need
    Of aid from them--She was the Universe.
                                                   
                          CHURCHILL'S GRAVE,

                      A FACT LITERALLY RENDERED.

    I stood beside the grave of him who blazed
    The Comet of a season, and I saw
    The humblest of all sepulchres, and gazed
      With not the less of sorrow and of awe
    On that neglected turf and quiet stone,
    With name no clearer than the names unknown,
    Which lay unread around it; and I asked
      The Gardener of that ground, why it might be
    That for this plant strangers his memory tasked,
      Through the thick deaths of half a century;
    And thus he answered--"Well, I do not know
    Why frequent travellers turn to pilgrims so;
    He died before my day of Sextonship,
      And I had not the digging of this grave."
    And is this all? I thought,--and do we rip
      The veil of Immortality, and crave
    I know not what of honour and of light
    Through unborn ages, to endure this blight?
    So soon, and so successless? As I said,
    The Architect of all on which we tread,
    For Earth is but a tombstone, did essay
    To extricate remembrance from the clay,
    Whose minglings might confuse a Newton's thought,
      Were it not that all life must end in one,
    Of which we are but dreamers;--as he caught
      As 'twere the twilight of a former Sun,
    Thus spoke he,--"I believe the man of whom
    You wot, who lies in this selected tomb,
    Was a most famous writer in his day,
    And therefore travellers step from out their way
    To pay him honour,--and myself whate'er
      Your honour pleases:"--then most pleased I shook
      From out my pocket's avaricious nook
    Some certain coins of silver, which as 'twere
    Perforce I gave this man, though I could spare
    So much but inconveniently:--Ye smile,
    I see ye, ye profane ones! all the while,
    Because my homely phrase the truth would tell.
    You are the fools, not I--for I did dwell
    With a deep thought, and with a softened eye,
    On that old Sexton's natural homily,
    In which there was Obscurity and Fame,--
    The Glory and the Nothing of a Name.
                                                           
                             PROMETHEUS.

                        I.

    Titan! to whose immortal eyes
      The sufferings of mortality,
      Seen in their sad reality,
    Were not as things that gods despise;
    What was thy pity's recompense?
    A silent suffering, and intense;
    The rock, the vulture, and the chain,
    All that the proud can feel of pain,
    The agony they do not show,
    The suffocating sense of woe,
      Which speaks but in its loneliness,
    And then is jealous lest the sky
    Should have a listener, nor will sigh
      Until its voice is echoless.

                        II.

    Titan! to thee the strife was given
      Between the suffering and the will,
      Which torture where they cannot kill;
    And the inexorable Heaven,
    And the deaf tyranny of Fate,
    The ruling principle of Hate,
    Which for its pleasure doth create
    The things it may annihilate,
    Refused thee even the boon to die:
    The wretched gift Eternity
    Was thine--and thou hast borne it well.
    All that the Thunderer wrung from thee
    Was but the menace which flung back
    On him the torments of thy rack;
    The fate thou didst so well foresee,
    But would not to appease him tell;
    And in thy Silence was his Sentence,
    And in his Soul a vain repentance,
    And evil dread so ill dissembled,
    That in his hand the lightnings trembled.

                        III.

    Thy Godlike crime was to be kind,
      To render with thy precepts less
      The sum of human wretchedness,
    And strengthen Man with his own mind;
    But baffled as thou wert from high,
    Still in thy patient energy,
    In the endurance, and repulse
      Of thine impenetrable Spirit,
    Which Earth and Heaven could not convulse,
      A mighty lesson we inherit:
    Thou art a symbol and a sign
      To Mortals of their fate and force;
    Like thee, Man is in part divine,
    A troubled stream from a pure source;
    And Man in portions can foresee
    His own funereal destiny;
    His wretchedness, and his resistance,
    And his sad unallied existence:
    To which his Spirit may oppose
    Itself--an equal to all woes--
    And a firm will, and a deep sense,
    Which even in torture can descry
      Its own concentered recompense,
    Triumphant where it dares defy,
    And making Death a Victory.

                             A FRAGMENT.

    Could I remount the river of my years
    To the first fountain of our smiles and tears,
    I would not trace again the stream of hours
    Between their outworn banks of withered flowers,
    But bid it flow as now--until it glides
    Into the number of the nameless tides.

    What is this Death?--a quiet of the heart?
    The whole of that of which we are a part?
    For Life is but a vision--what I see
    Of all which lives alone is Life to me,
    And being so--the absent are the dead,
    Who haunt us from tranquillity, and spread
    A dreary shroud around us, and invest
    With sad remembrancers our hours of rest.
      The absent are the dead--for they are cold,
    And ne'er can be what once we did behold;
    And they are changed, and cheerless,--or if yet
    The unforgotten do not all forget,
    Since thus divided--equal must it be
    If the deep barrier be of earth, or sea;
    It may be both--but one day end it must
    In the dark union of insensate dust.
      The under-earth inhabitants--are they
    But mingled millions decomposed to clay?
    The ashes of a thousand ages spread
    Wherever Man has trodden or shall tread?
    Or do they in their silent cities dwell
    Each in his incommunicative cell?
    Or have they their own language? and a sense
    Of breathless being?--darkened and intense
    As Midnight in her solitude?--Oh Earth!
    Where are the past?--and wherefore had they birth?
    The dead are thy inheritors--and we
    But bubbles on thy surface; and the key
    Of thy profundity is in the Grave,
    The ebon portal of thy peopled cave,
    Where I would walk in spirit, and behold
    Our elements resolved to things untold,
    And fathom hidden wonders, and explore
    The essence of great bosoms now no more.
     
                          SONNET TO LAKE LEMAN.

    Rousseau--Voltaire--our Gibbon--and De Stael--
      Leman! these names are worthy of thy shore,
      Thy shore of names like these! wert thou no more,
    Their memory thy remembrance would recall:
    To them thy banks were lovely as to all,
      But they have made them lovelier, for the lore
      Of mighty minds doth hallow in the core
    Of human hearts the ruin of a wall
      Where dwelt the wise and wondrous; but by thee
    How much more, Lake of Beauty! do we feel,
      In sweetly gliding o'er thy crystal sea,
    The wild glow of that not ungentle zeal,
      Which of the Heirs of Immortality
    Is proud, and makes the breath of Glory real!
                                                   
                        STANZAS TO AUGUSTA.

                        I.

    Though the day of my Destiny's over,
      And the star of my Fate hath declined,
    Thy soft heart refused to discover
      The faults which so many could find;
    Though thy Soul with my grief was acquainted,
      It shrunk not to share it with me,
    And the Love which my Spirit hath painted
      It never hath found but in Thee.

                        II.

    Then when Nature around me is smiling,
      The last smile which answers to mine,
    I do not believe it beguiling,
      Because it reminds me of thine;
    And when winds are at war with the ocean,
      As the breasts I believed in with me,
    If their billows excite an emotion,
      It is that they bear me from Thee.

                        III.

    Though the rock of my last Hope is shivered,
      And its fragments are sunk in the wave,
    Though I feel that my soul is delivered
      To Pain--it shall not be its slave.
    There is many a pang to pursue me:
      They may crush, but they shall not contemn;
    They may torture, but shall not subdue me;
      'Tis of Thee that I think--not of them.

                        IV.

    Though human, thou didst not deceive me,
      Though woman, thou didst not forsake,
    Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,
      Though slandered, thou never couldst shake;
    Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,
      Though parted, it was not to fly,
    Though watchful, 'twas not to defame me,
      Nor, mute, that the world might belie.

                        V.

    Yet I blame not the World, nor despise it,
      Nor the war of the many with one;
    If my Soul was not fitted to prize it,
      'Twas folly not sooner to shun:
    And if dearly that error hath cost me,
      And more than I once could foresee,
    I have found that, whatever it lost me,
      It could not deprive me of Thee.

                        VI.

    From the wreck of the past, which hath perished,
      Thus much I at least may recall,
    It hath taught me that what I most cherished
      Deserved to be dearest of all:
    In the Desert a fountain is springing,
      In the wide waste there still is a tree,
    And a bird in the solitude singing,
      Which speaks to my spirit of Thee.
                                                        
                         EPISTLE TO AUGUSTA.

                        I.

      My Sister! my sweet Sister! if a name
      Dearer and purer were, it should be thine.
      Mountains and seas divide us, but I claim
      No tears, but tenderness to answer mine:
      Go where I will, to me thou art the same--
      A loved regret which I would not resign.
      There yet are two things in my destiny,--
    A world to roam through, and a home with thee.

                        II.

      The first were nothing--had I still the last,
      It were the haven of my happiness;
      But other claims and other ties thou hast,
      And mine is not the wish to make them less.
      A strange doom is thy father's son's, and past
      Recalling, as it lies beyond redress;
      Reversed for him our grandsire's fate of yore,--
    He had no rest at sea, nor I on shore.

                        III.

      If my inheritance of storms hath been
      In other elements, and on the rocks
      Of perils, overlooked or unforeseen,
      I have sustained my share of worldly shocks,
      The fault was mine; nor do I seek to screen
      My errors with defensive paradox;
      I have been cunning in mine overthrow,
    The careful pilot of my proper woe.

                        IV.

      Mine were my faults, and mine be their reward.
      My whole life was a contest, since the day
      That gave me being, gave me that which marred
      The gift,--a fate, or will, that walked astray;
      And I at times have found the struggle hard,
      And thought of shaking off my bonds of clay:
      But now I fain would for a time survive,
    If but to see what next can well arrive.

                        V.

      Kingdoms and Empires in my little day
      I have outlived, and yet I am not old;
      And when I look on this, the petty spray
      Of my own years of trouble, which have rolled
      Like a wild bay of breakers, melts away:
      Something--I know not what--does still uphold
      A spirit of slight patience;--not in vain,
    Even for its own sake, do we purchase Pain.

                        VI.

      Perhaps the workings of defiance stir
      Within me--or, perhaps, a cold despair
      Brought on when ills habitually recur,--
      Perhaps a kinder clime, or purer air,
      (For even to this may change of soul refer,
      And with light armour we may learn to bear,)
      Have taught me a strange quiet, which was not
    The chief companion of a calmer lot.

                        VII.

      I feel almost at times as I have felt
      In happy childhood; trees, and flowers, and brooks,
      Which do remember me of where I dwelt,
      Ere my young mind was sacrificed to books,
      Come as of yore upon me, and can melt
      My heart with recognition of their looks;
      And even at moments I could think I see
    Some living thing to love--but none like thee.

                        VIII.

      Here are the Alpine landscapes which create
      A fund for contemplation;--to admire
      Is a brief feeling of a trivial date;
      But something worthier do such scenes inspire:
      Here to be lonely is not desolate,
      For much I view which I could most desire,
      And, above all, a Lake I can behold
    Lovelier, not dearer, than our own of old.

                        IX.

      Oh that thou wert but with me!--but I grow
      The fool of my own wishes, and forget
      The solitude which I have vaunted so
      Has lost its praise in this but one regret;
      There may be others which I less may show;--
      I am not of the plaintive mood, and yet
      I feel an ebb in my philosophy,
    And the tide rising in my altered eye.

                        X.

      I did remind thee of our own dear Lake,
      By the old Hall which may be mine no more.
      Leman's is fair; but think not I forsake
      The sweet remembrance of a dearer shore:
      Sad havoc Time must with my memory make,
      Ere that or thou can fade these eyes before;
      Though, like all things which I have loved, they are
    Resigned for ever, or divided far.

                        XI.

      The world is all before me; I but ask
      Of Nature that with which she will comply--
      It is but in her Summer's sun to bask,
      To mingle with the quiet of her sky,
      To see her gentle face without a mask,
      And never gaze on it with apathy.
      She was my early friend, and now shall be
    My sister--till I look again on thee.

                        XII.

      I can reduce all feelings but this one;
      And that I would not;--for at length I see
      Such scenes as those wherein my life begun--
      The earliest--even the only paths for me--
      Had I but sooner learnt the crowd to shun,
      I had been better than I now can be;
      The Passions which have torn me would have slept;
    I had not suffered, and thou hadst not wept.

                        XIII.

      With false Ambition what had I to do?
      Little with Love, and least of all with Fame;
      And yet they came unsought, and with me grew,
      And made me all which they can make--a Name.
      Yet this was not the end I did pursue;
      Surely I once beheld a nobler aim.
      But all is over--I am one the more
    To baffled millions which have gone before.

                        XIV.

      And for the future, this world's future may
      From me demand but little of my care;
      I have outlived myself by many a day;
      Having survived so many things that were;
      My years have been no slumber, but the prey
      Of ceaseless vigils; for I had the share
      Of life which might have filled a century,
    Before its fourth in time had passed me by.

                        XV.

      And for the remnant which may be to come
      I am content; and for the past I feel
      Not thankless,--for within the crowded sum
      Of struggles, Happiness at times would steal,
      And for the present, I would not benumb
      My feelings farther.--Nor shall I conceal
      That with all this I still can look around,
    And worship Nature with a thought profound.

                        XVI.

      For thee, my own sweet sister, in thy heart
      I know myself secure, as thou in mine;
      We were and are--I am, even as thou art--
      Beings who ne'er each other can resign;
      It is the same, together or apart,
      From Life's commencement to its slow decline
      We are entwined--let Death come slow or fast,
    The tie which bound the first endures the last!

              LINES ON HEARING THAT LADY BYRON WAS ILL.

    And thou wert sad--yet I was not with thee;
      And thou wert sick, and yet I was not near;
    Methought that Joy and Health alone could be
      Where I was not--and pain and sorrow here!
    And is it thus?--it is as I foretold,
      And shall be more so; for the mind recoils
    Upon itself, and the wrecked heart lies cold,
      While Heaviness collects the shattered spoils.
    It is not in the storm nor in the strife
      We feel benumbed, and wish to be no more,
      But in the after-silence on the shore,
    When all is lost, except a little life.

    I am too well avenged!--but 'twas my right;
      Whate'er my sins might be, thou wert not sent
    To be the Nemesis who should requite--
      Nor did Heaven choose so near an instrument.
    Mercy is for the merciful!--if thou
    Hast been of such, 'twill be accorded now.
    Thy nights are banished from the realms of sleep:--
      Yes! they may flatter thee, but thou shall feel
      A hollow agony which will not heal,
    For thou art pillowed on a curse too deep;
    Thou hast sown in my sorrow, and must reap
      The bitter harvest in a woe as real!
    I have had many foes, but none like thee;
      For 'gainst the rest myself I could defend,
      And be avenged, or turn them into friend;
    But thou in safe implacability
    Hadst nought to dread--in thy own weakness shielded,
    And in my love, which hath but too much yielded,
      And spared, for thy sake, some I should not spare;
    And thus upon the world--trust in thy truth,
    And the wild fame of my ungoverned youth--
      On things that were not, and on things that are--
    Even upon such a basis hast thou built
    A monument, whose cement hath been guilt!
      The moral Clytemnestra of thy lord,
      And hewed down, with an unsuspected sword,
    Fame, peace, and hope--and all the better life
      Which, but for this cold treason of thy heart,
    Might still have risen from out the grave of strife,
      And found a nobler duty than to part.
    But of thy virtues didst thou make a vice,
      Trafficking with them in a purpose cold,
      For present anger, and for future gold--
    And buying others' grief at any price.
    And thus once entered into crooked ways,
    The early truth, which was thy proper praise,
    Did not still walk beside thee--but at times,
    And with a breast unknowing its own crimes,
    Deceit, averments incompatible,
    Equivocations, and the thoughts which dwell
      In Janus-spirits--the significant eye
    Which learns to lie with silence--the pretext
    Of prudence, with advantages annexed--
    The acquiescence in all things which tend,
    No matter how, to the desired end--
      All found a place in thy philosophy.
    The means were worthy, and the end is won--
    I would not do by thee as thou hast done!

                            MONODY ON THE DEATH

                                   OF THE

                         RIGHT HON. R. B. SHERIDAN,

                   SPOKEN AT DRURY-LANE THEATRE, LONDON.

    When the last sunshine of expiring Day
    In Summer's twilight weeps itself away,
    Who hath not felt the softness of the hour
    Sink on the heart, as dew along the flower?
    With a pure feeling which absorbs and awes
    While Nature makes that melancholy pause--
    Her breathing moment on the bridge where Time
    Of light and darkness forms an arch sublime--
    Who hath not shared that calm, so still and deep,
    The voiceless thought which would not speak but weep,
    A holy concord, and a bright regret,
    A glorious sympathy with suns that set?
    'Tis not harsh sorrow, but a tenderer woe,
    Nameless, but dear to gentle hearts below,
    Felt without bitterness--but full and clear,
    A sweet dejection--a transparent tear,
    Unmixed with worldly grief or selfish stain--
    Shed without shame, and secret without pain.
    Even as the tenderness that hour instils
    When Summer's day declines along the hills,
    So feels the fulness of our heart and eyes
    When all of Genius which can perish dies.
    A mighty Spirit is eclipsed--a Power
    Hath passed from day to darkness--to whose hour
    Of light no likeness is bequeathed--no name,
    Focus at once of all the rays of Fame!
    The flash of Wit--the bright Intelligence,
    The beam of Song--the blaze of Eloquence,
    Set with their Sun, but still have left behind
    The enduring produce of immortal Mind;
    Fruits of a genial morn, and glorious noon,
    A deathless part of him who died too soon.
    But small that portion of the wondrous whole,
    These sparkling segments of that circling Soul,
    Which all embraced, and lightened over all,
    To cheer--to pierce--to please--or to appal.
    From the charmed council to the festive board,
    Of human feelings the unbounded lord;
    In whose acclaim the loftiest voices vied,
    The praised--the proud--who made his praise their pride.
    When the loud cry of trampled Hindostan
    Arose to Heaven in her appeal from Man,
    His was the thunder--his the avenging rod,
    The wrath--the delegated voice of God!
    Which shook the nations through his lips, and blazed
    Till vanquished senates trembled as they praised.

    And here, oh! here, where yet all young and warm,
    The gay creations of his spirit charm,
    The matchless dialogue--the deathless wit,
    Which knew not what it was to intermit;
    The glowing portraits, fresh from life, that bring
    Home to our hearts the truth from which they spring;
    These wondrous beings of his fancy, wrought
    To fulness by the fiat of his thought,
    Here in their first abode you still may meet,
    Bright with the hues of his Promethean heat;
    A Halo of the light of other days,
    Which still the splendour of its orb betrays.
    But should there be to whom the fatal blight
    Of failing Wisdom yields a base delight,
    Men who exult when minds of heavenly tone
    Jar in the music which was born their own,
    Still let them pause--ah! little do they know
    That what to them seemed Vice might be but Woe.
    Hard is his fate on whom the public gaze
    Is fixed for ever to detract or praise;
    Repose denies her requiem to his name,
    And Folly loves the martyrdom of Fame.
    The secret Enemy whose sleepless eye
    Stands sentinel--accuser--judge--and spy.
    The foe, the fool, the jealous, and the vain,
    The envious who but breathe in other's pain--
    Behold the host! delighting to deprave,
    Who track the steps of Glory to the grave,
    Watch every fault that daring Genius owes
    Half to the ardour which its birth bestows,
    Distort the truth, accumulate the lie,
    And pile the Pyramid of Calumny!
    These are his portion--but if joined to these
    Gaunt Poverty should league with deep Disease,
    If the high Spirit must forget to soar,
    And stoop to strive with Misery at the door,
    To soothe Indignity--and face to face
    Meet sordid Rage, and wrestle with Disgrace,
    To find in Hope but the renewed caress,
    The serpent-fold of further Faithlessness:--
    If such may be the Ills which men assail,
    What marvel if at last the mightiest fail?
    Breasts to whom all the strength of feeling given
    Bear hearts electric-charged with fire from Heaven,
    Black with the rude collision, inly torn,
    By clouds surrounded, and on whirlwinds borne,
    Driven o'er the lowering atmosphere that nurst
    Thoughts which have turned to thunder--scorch, and burst.

    But far from us and from our mimic scene
    Such things should be--if such have ever been;
    Ours be the gentler wish, the kinder task,
    To give the tribute Glory need not ask,
    To mourn the vanished beam, and add our mite
    Of praise in payment of a long delight.
    Ye Orators! whom yet our councils yield,
    Mourn for the veteran Hero of your field!
    The worthy rival of the wondrous Three!
    Whose words were sparks of Immortality!
    Ye Bards! to whom the Drama's Muse is dear,
    He was your Master--emulate him here!
    Ye men of wit and social eloquence!
    He was your brother--bear his ashes hence!
    While Powers of mind almost of boundless range,
    Complete in kind, as various in their change,
    While Eloquence--Wit--Poesy--and Mirth,
    That humbler Harmonist of care on Earth,
    Survive within our souls--while lives our sense
    Of pride in Merit's proud pre-eminence,
    Long shall we seek his likeness--long in vain,
    And turn to all of him which may remain,
    Sighing that Nature formed but one such man,
    And broke the die--in moulding Sheridan!

                        THE LAMENT OF TASSO.

                        I.

    Long years!--It tries the thrilling frame to bear
    And eagle-spirit of a Child of Song--
    Long years of outrage--calumny--and wrong;
    Imputed madness, prisoned solitude,
    And the Mind's canker in its savage mood,
    When the impatient thirst of light and air
    Parches the heart; and the abhorred grate,
    Marring the sunbeams with its hideous shade,
    Works through the throbbing eyeball to the brain,
    With a hot sense of heaviness and pain;
    And bare, at once, Captivity displayed
    Stands scoffing through the never-opened gate,
    Which nothing through its bars admits, save day,
    And tasteless food, which I have eat alone
    Till its unsocial bitterness is gone;
    And I can banquet like a beast of prey,
    Sullen and lonely, couching in the cave
    Which is my lair, and--it may be--my grave.
    All this hath somewhat worn me, and may wear,
    But must be borne. I stoop not to despair;
    For I have battled with mine agony,
    And made me wings wherewith to overfly
    The narrow circus of my dungeon wall,
    And freed the Holy Sepulchre from thrall;
    And revelled among men and things divine,
    And poured my spirit over Palestine,
    In honour of the sacred war for Him,
    The God who was on earth and is in Heaven,
    For He has strengthened me in heart and limb.
    That through this sufferance I might be forgiven,
    I have employed my penance to record
    How Salem's shrine was won, and how adored.

                        II.

    But this is o'er--my pleasant task is done:--
    My long-sustaining Friend of many years!
    If I do blot thy final page with tears,
    Know, that my sorrows have wrung from me none.
    But Thou, my young creation! my Soul's child!
    Which ever playing round me came and smiled,
    And wooed me from myself with thy sweet sight,
    Thou too art gone--and so is my delight:
    And therefore do I weep and inly bleed
    With this last bruise upon a broken reed.
    Thou too art ended--what is left me now?
    For I have anguish yet to bear--and how?
    I know not that--but in the innate force
    Of my own spirit shall be found resource.
    I have not sunk, for I had no remorse,
    Nor cause for such: they called me mad--and why?
    Oh Leonora! wilt not thou reply?
    I was indeed delirious in my heart
    To lift my love so lofty as thou art;
    But still my frenzy was not of the mind:
    I knew my fault, and feel my punishment
    Not less because I suffer it unbent.
    That thou wert beautiful, and I not blind,
    Hath been the sin which shuts me from mankind;
    But let them go, or torture as they will,
    My heart can multiply thine image still;
    Successful Love may sate itself away;
    The wretched are the faithful; 't is their fate
    To have all feeling, save the one, decay,
    And every passion into one dilate,
    As rapid rivers into Ocean pour;
    But ours is fathomless, and hath no shore.

                        III.

    Above me, hark! the long and maniac cry
    Of minds and bodies in captivity.
    And hark! the lash and the increasing howl,
    And the half-inarticulate blasphemy!
    There be some here with worse than frenzy foul,
    Some who do still goad on the o'er-laboured mind,
    And dim the little light that's left behind
    With needless torture, as their tyrant Will
    Is wound up to the lust of doing ill:
    With these and with their victims am I classed,
    'Mid sounds and sights like these long years have passed;
    'Mid sights and sounds like these my life may close:
    So let it be--for then I shall repose.

                        IV.

    I have been patient, let me be so yet;
    I had forgotten half I would forget,
    But it revives--Oh! would it were my lot
    To be forgetful as I am forgot!--
    Feel I not wroth with those who bade me dwell
    In this vast Lazar-house of many woes?
    Where laughter is not mirth, nor thought the mind,
    Nor words a language, nor ev'n men mankind;
    Where cries reply to curses, shrieks to blows,
    And each is tortured in his separate hell--
    For we are crowded in our solitudes--
    Many, but each divided by the wall,
    Which echoes Madness in her babbling moods;
    While all can hear, none heed his neighbour's call--
    None! save that One, the veriest wretch of all,
    Who was not made to be the mate of these,
    Nor bound between Distraction and Disease.
    Feel I not wroth with those who placed me here?
    Who have debased me in the minds of men,
    Debarring me the usage of my own,
    Blighting my life in best of its career,
    Branding my thoughts as things to shun and fear?
    Would I not pay them back these pangs again,
    And teach them inward Sorrow's stifled groan?
    The struggle to be calm, and cold distress,
    Which undermines our Stoical success?
    No!--still too proud to be vindictive--I
    Have pardoned Princes' insults, and would die.
    Yes, Sister of my Sovereign! for thy sake
    I weed all bitterness from out my breast,
    It hath no business where thou art a guest:
    Thy brother hates--but I can not detest;
    Thou pitiest not--but I can not forsake.

                        V.

    Look on a love which knows not to despair,
    But all unquenched is still my better part,
    Dwelling deep in my shut and silent heart,
    As dwells the gathered lightning in its cloud,
    Encompassed with its dark and rolling shroud,
    Till struck,--forth flies the all-ethereal dart!
    And thus at the collision of thy name
    The vivid thought still flashes through my frame,
    And for a moment all things as they were
    Flit by me;--they are gone--I am the same.
    And yet my love without ambition grew;
    I knew thy state--my station--and I knew
    A Princess was no love-mate for a bard;
    I told it not--I breathed it not--it was
    Sufficient to itself, its own reward;
    And if my eyes revealed it, they, alas!
    Were punished by the silentness of thine,
    And yet I did not venture to repine.
    Thou wert to me a crystal-girded shrine,
    Worshipped at holy distance, and around
    Hallowed and meekly kissed the saintly ground;
    Not for thou wert a Princess, but that Love
    Had robed thee with a glory, and arrayed
    Thy lineaments in beauty that dismayed--
    Oh! not dismayed--but awed, like One above!
    And in that sweet severity there was
    A something which all softness did surpass--
    I know not how--thy Genius mastered mine--
    My Star stood still before thee:--if it were
    Presumptuous thus to love without design,
    That sad fatality hath cost me dear;
    But thou art dearest still, and I should be
    Fit for this cell, which wrongs me--but for thee.
    The very love which locked me to my chain
    Hath lightened half its weight; and for the rest,
    Though heavy, lent me vigour to sustain,
    And look to thee with undivided breast,
    And foil the ingenuity of Pain.

                        VI.

    It is no marvel--from my very birth
    My soul was drunk with Love,--which did pervade
    And mingle with whate'er I saw on earth:
    Of objects all inanimate I made
    Idols, and out of wild and lonely flowers,
    And rocks, whereby they grew, a Paradise,
    Where I did lay me down within the shade
    Of waving trees, and dreamed uncounted hours,
    Though I was chid for wandering; and the Wise
    Shook their white aged heads o'er me, and said
    Of such materials wretched men were made,
    And such a truant boy would end in woe,
    And that the only lesson was a blow;--
    And then they smote me, and I did not weep,
    But cursed them in my heart, and to my haunt
    Returned and wept alone, and dreamed again
    The visions which arise without a sleep.
    And with my years my soul began to pant
    With feelings of strange tumult and soft pain;
    And the whole heart exhaled into One Want,
    But undefined and wandering, till the day
    I found the thing I sought--and that was thee;
    And then I lost my being, all to be
    Absorbed in thine;--the world was past away;--
    Thou didst annihilate the earth to me!

                        VII.

    I loved all Solitude--but little thought
    To spend I know not what of life, remote
    From all communion with existence, save
    The maniac and his tyrant;--had I been
    Their fellow, many years ere this had seen
    My mind like theirs corrupted to its grave.
    But who hath seen me writhe, or heard me rave?
    Perchance in such a cell we suffer more
    Than the wrecked sailor on his desert shore;
    The world is all before him--mine is here,
    Scarce twice the space they must accord my bier.
    What though he perish, he may lift his eye,
    And with a dying glance upbraid the sky;
    I will not raise my own in such reproof,
    Although 'tis clouded by my dungeon roof.

                        VIII.

    Yet do I feel at times my mind decline,
    But with a sense of its decay: I see
    Unwonted lights along my prison shine,
    And a strange Demon, who is vexing me
    With pilfering pranks and petty pains, below
    The feeling of the healthful and the free;
    But much to One, who long hath suffered so,
    Sickness of heart, and narrowness of place,
    And all that may be borne, or can debase.
    I thought mine enemies had been but Man,
    But Spirits may be leagued with them--all Earth
    Abandons--Heaven forgets me;--in the dearth
    Of such defence the Powers of Evil can--
    It may be--tempt me further,--and prevail
    Against the outworn creature they assail.
    Why in this furnace is my spirit proved,
    Like steel in tempering fire? because I loved?
    Because I loved what not to love, and see,
    Was more or less than mortal, and than me.

                        IX.

    I once was quick in feeling--that is o'er;--
    My scars are callous, or I should have dashed
    My brain against these bars, as the sun flashed
    In mockery through them;--- If I bear and bore
    The much I have recounted, and the more
    Which hath no words,--'t is that I would not die
    And sanction with self-slaughter the dull lie
    Which snared me here, and with the brand of shame
    Stamp Madness deep into my memory,
    And woo Compassion to a blighted name,
    Sealing the sentence which my foes proclaim.
    No--it shall be immortal!--and I make
    A future temple of my present cell,
    Which nations yet shall visit for my sake.
    While thou, Ferrara! when no longer dwell
    The ducal chiefs within thee, shall fall down,
    And crumbling piecemeal view thy hearthless halls,
    A Poet's wreath shall be thine only crown,--
    A Poet's dungeon thy most far renown,
    While strangers wonder o'er thy unpeopled walls!
    And thou, Leonora!--thou--who wert ashamed
    That such as I could love--who blushed to hear
    To less than monarchs that thou couldst be dear,
    Go! tell thy brother, that my heart, untamed
    By grief--years--weariness--and it may be
    A taint of that he would impute to me--
    From long infection of a den like this,
    Where the mind rots congenial with the abyss,--
    Adores thee still;--and add--that when the towers
    And battlements which guard his joyous hours
    Of banquet, dance, and revel, are forgot,
    Or left untended in a dull repose,
    This--this--shall be a consecrated spot!
    But Thou--when all that Birth and Beauty throws
    Of magic round thee is extinct--shalt have
    One half the laurel which o'ershades my grave.
    No power in death can tear our names apart,
    As none in life could rend thee from my heart.
    Yes, Leonora! it shall be our fate
    To be entwined for ever--but too late!

                               BEPPO:

                          A VENETIAN STORY.

    Rosalind. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; Look, you lisp,
    and wear strange suits: disable all the benefits of your own
    country; be out of love with your Nativity, and almost chide
    God for making you that countenance you are; or I will
    scarce think you have swam in a Gondola.

                             As You Like It, act iv, sc. I, lines 33-35.

                    Annotation of the Commentators.
  That is, been at Venice, which was much visited by the young English
  gentlemen of those times, and was then what Paris is now--the seat
  of all dissoluteness.--S. A.
          
                               BEPPO.

                        I.

    'Tis known, at least it should be, that throughout
      All countries of the Catholic persuasion,
    Some weeks before Shrove Tuesday comes about,
      The People take their fill of recreation,
    And buy repentance, ere they grow devout,
      However high their rank, or low their station,
    With fiddling, feasting, dancing, drinking, masquing,
    And other things which may be had for asking.

                        II.

    The moment night with dusky mantle covers
      The skies (and the more duskily the better),
    The Time less liked by husbands than by lovers
      Begins, and Prudery flings aside her fetter;
    And Gaiety on restless tiptoe hovers,
      Giggling with all the gallants who beset her;
    And there are songs and quavers, roaring, humming,
    Guitars, and every other sort of strumming.

                        III.

    And there are dresses splendid, but fantastical,
      Masks of all times and nations, Turks and Jews,
    And harlequins and clowns, with feats gymnastical,
      Greeks, Romans, Yankee-doodles, and Hindoos;
    All kinds of dress, except the ecclesiastical,
      All people, as their fancies hit, may choose,
    But no one in these parts may quiz the Clergy,--
    Therefore take heed, ye Freethinkers! I charge ye.

                        IV.

    You'd better walk about begirt with briars,
      Instead of coat and smallclothes, than put on
    A single stitch reflecting upon friars,
      Although you swore it only was in fun;
    They'd haul you o'er the coals, and stir the fires
      Of Phlegethon with every mother's son,
    Nor say one mass to cool the cauldron's bubble
    That boiled your bones, unless you paid them double.

                        V.

    But saving this, you may put on whate'er
      You like by way of doublet, cape, or cloak,
    Such as in Monmouth-street, or in Rag Fair,
      Would rig you out in seriousness or joke;
    And even in Italy such places are,
      With prettier name in softer accents spoke,
    For, bating Covent Garden, I can hit on
    No place that's called "Piazza" in Great Britain.

                        VI.

    This feast is named the Carnival, which being
      Interpreted, implies "farewell to flesh:"
    So called, because the name and thing agreeing,
      Through Lent they live on fish both salt and fresh.
    But why they usher Lent with so much glee in,
      Is more than I can tell, although I guess
    'Tis as we take a glass with friends at parting,
    In the Stage-Coach or Packet, just at starting.

                        VII.

    And thus they bid farewell to carnal dishes,
      And solid meats, and highly spiced ragouts,
    To live for forty days on ill-dressed fishes,
      Because they have no sauces to their stews;
    A thing which causes many "poohs" and "pishes,"
      And several oaths (which would not suit the Muse),
    From travellers accustomed from a boy
    To eat their salmon, at the least, with soy;

                        VIII.

    And therefore humbly I would recommend
      "The curious in fish-sauce," before they cross
    The sea, to bid their cook, or wife, or friend,
       Walk or ride to the Strand, and buy in gross
    (Or if set out beforehand, these may send
       By any means least liable to loss),
    Ketchup, Soy, Chili-vinegar, and Harvey,
    Or, by the Lord! a Lent will well nigh starve ye;

                        IX.

    That is to say, if your religion's Roman,
      And you at Rome would do as Romans do,
    According to the proverb,--although no man,
      If foreign, is obliged to fast; and you,
    If Protestant, or sickly, or a woman,
      Would rather dine in sin on a ragout--
    Dine and be d--d! I don't mean to be coarse,
    But that's the penalty, to say no worse.

                        X.

    Of all the places where the Carnival
      Was most facetious in the days of yore,
    For dance, and song, and serenade, and ball,
      And Masque, and Mime, and Mystery, and more
    Than I have time to tell now, or at all,
      Venice the bell from every city bore,--
    And at the moment when I fix my story,
    That sea-born city was in all her glory.

                        XI.

    They've pretty faces yet, those same Venetians,
      Black eyes, arched brows, and sweet expressions still;
    Such as of old were copied from the Grecians,
      In ancient arts by moderns mimicked ill;
    And like so many Venuses of Titian's
      (The best's at Florence--see it, if ye will,)
    They look when leaning over the balcony,
    Or stepped from out a picture by Giorgione,

                        XII.

    Whose tints are Truth and Beauty at their best;
      And when you to Manfrini's palace go,
    That picture (howsoever fine the rest)
      Is loveliest to my mind of all the show;
    It may perhaps be also to your zest,
      And that's the cause I rhyme upon it so:
    Tis but a portrait of his Son, and Wife,
    And self; but such a Woman! Love in life!

                        XIII.

    Love in full life and length, not love ideal,
      No, nor ideal beauty, that fine name,
    But something better still, so very real,
      That the sweet Model must have been the same;
    A thing that you would purchase, beg, or steal,
      Wer't not impossible, besides a shame:
    The face recalls some face, as 'twere with pain,
    You once have seen, but ne'er will see again;

                        XIV.

    One of those forms which flit by us, when we
      Are young, and fix our eyes on every face;
    And, oh! the Loveliness at times we see
      In momentary gliding, the soft grace,
    The Youth, the Bloom, the Beauty which agree,
      In many a nameless being we retrace,
    Whose course and home we knew not, nor shall know,
    Like the lost Pleiad seen no more below.

                        XV.

    I said that like a picture by Giorgione
      Venetian women were, and so they are,
    Particularly seen from a balcony,
      (For beauty's sometimes best set off afar)
    And there, just like a heroine of Goldoni,
      They peep from out the blind, or o'er the bar;
    And truth to say, they're mostly very pretty,
    And rather like to show it, more's the pity!

                        XVI.

    For glances beget ogles, ogles sighs,
      Sighs wishes, wishes words, and words a letter,
    Which flies on wings of light-heeled Mercuries,
      Who do such things because they know no better;
    And then, God knows what mischief may arise,
      When Love links two young people in one fetter,
    Vile assignations, and adulterous beds,
    Elopements, broken vows, and hearts, and heads.

                        XVII.

    Shakspeare described the sex in Desdemona
      As very fair, but yet suspect in fame,
    And to this day from Venice to Verona
      Such matters may be probably the same,
    Except that since those times was never known a
      Husband whom mere suspicion could inflame
    To suffocate a wife no more than twenty,
    Because she had a "Cavalier Servente."

                        XVIII.

    Their jealousy (if they are ever jealous)
      Is of a fair complexion altogether,
    Not like that sooty devil of Othello's,
      Which smothers women in a bed of feather,
    But worthier of these much more jolly fellows,
      When weary of the matrimonial tether
    His head for such a wife no mortal bothers,
    But takes at once another, or another's.

                        XIX.

    Didst ever see a Gondola? For fear
      You should not, I'll describe it you exactly:
    'Tis a long covered boat that's common here,
      Carved at the prow, built lightly, but compactly,
    Rowed by two rowers, each call'd "Gondolier,"
      It glides along the water looking blackly,
    Just like a coffin clapt in a canoe,
    Where none can make out what you say or do.

                        XX.

    And up and down the long canals they go,
      And under the Rialto shoot along,
    By night and day, all paces, swift or slow,
      And round the theatres, a sable throng,
    They wait in their dusk livery of woe,--
      But not to them do woeful things belong,
    For sometimes they contain a deal of fun,
    Like mourning coaches when the funeral's done.

                        XXI.

    But to my story.--'Twas some years ago,
      It may be thirty, forty, more or less,
    The Carnival was at its height, and so
      Were all kinds of buffoonery and dress;
    A certain lady went to see the show,
      Her real name I know not, nor can guess,
    And so we'll call her Laura, if you please,
    Because it slips into my verse with ease.

                        XXII.

    She was not old, nor young, nor at the years
      Which certain people call a "certain age,"
    Which yet the most uncertain age appears,
      Because I never heard, nor could engage
    A person yet by prayers, or bribes, or tears,
      To name, define by speech, or write on page,
    The period meant precisely by that word,--
    Which surely is exceedingly absurd.

                        XXIII.

    Laura was blooming still, had made the best
      Of Time, and Time returned the compliment,
    And treated her genteelly, so that, dressed,
      She looked extremely well where'er she went;
    A pretty woman is a welcome guest,
      And Laura's brow a frown had rarely bent;
    Indeed, she shone all smiles, and seemed to flatter
    Mankind with her black eyes for looking at her.

                        XXIV.

    She was a married woman; 'tis convenient,
      Because in Christian countries 'tis a rule
    To view their little slips with eyes more lenient;
      Whereas if single ladies play the fool,
    (Unless within the period intervenient
      A well-timed wedding makes the scandal cool)
    I don't know how they ever can get over it,
    Except they manage never to discover it.

                        XXV.

    Her husband sailed upon the Adriatic,
      And made some voyages, too, in other seas,
    And when he lay in Quarantine for pratique
      (A forty days' precaution 'gainst disease),
    His wife would mount, at times, her highest attic,
      For thence she could discern the ship with ease:
    He was a merchant trading to Aleppo,
    His name Giuseppe, called more briefly, Beppo.

                        XXVI.

    He was a man as dusky as a Spaniard,
      Sunburnt with travel, yet a portly figure;
    Though coloured, as it were, within a tanyard,
      He was a person both of sense and vigour--
    A better seaman never yet did man yard;
      And she, although her manners showed no rigour,
    Was deemed a woman of the strictest principle,
    So much as to be thought almost invincible.

                        XXVII.

    But several years elapsed since they had met;
      Some people thought the ship was lost, and some
    That he had somehow blundered into debt,
      And did not like the thought of steering home;
    And there were several offered any bet,
      Or that he would, or that he would not come;
    For most men (till by losing rendered sager)
    Will back their own opinions with a wager.

                        XXVIII.

    'Tis said that their last parting was pathetic,
      As partings often are, or ought to be,
    And their presentiment was quite prophetic,
      That they should never more each other see,
    (A sort of morbid feeling, half poetic,
      Which I have known occur in two or three,)
    When kneeling on the shore upon her sad knee
    He left this Adriatic Ariadne.

                        XXIX.

    And Laura waited long, and wept a little,
      And thought of wearing weeds, as well she might;
    She almost lost all appetite for victual,
      And could not sleep with ease alone at night;
    She deemed the window-frames and shutters brittle
      Against a daring housebreaker or sprite,
    And so she thought it prudent to connect her
    With a vice-husband, chiefly to protect her.

                        XXX.

    She chose, (and what is there they will not choose,
      If only you will but oppose their choice?)
    Till Beppo should return from his long cruise,
      And bid once more her faithful heart rejoice,
    A man some women like, and yet abuse--
      A Coxcomb was he by the public voice;
    A Count of wealth, they said as well as quality,
    And in his pleasures of great liberality.

                        XXXI.

    And then he was a Count, and then he knew
      Music, and dancing, fiddling, French and Tuscan;
    The last not easy, be it known to you,
      For few Italians speak the right Etruscan.
    He was a critic upon operas, too,
      And knew all niceties of sock and buskin;
    And no Venetian audience could endure a
    Song, scene, or air, when he cried "seccatura!"

                        XXXII.

    His "bravo" was decisive, for that sound
      Hushed "Academie" sighed in silent awe;
    The fiddlers trembled as he looked around,
      For fear of some false note's detected flaw;
    The "Prima Donna's" tuneful heart would bound,
      Dreading the deep damnation of his "Bah!"
    Soprano, Basso, even the Contra-Alto,
    Wished him five fathom under the Rialto.

                        XXXIII.

    He patronised the Improvisatori,
      Nay, could himself extemporise some stanzas,
    Wrote rhymes, sang songs, could also tell a story,
      Sold pictures, and was skilful in the dance as
    Italians can be, though in this their glory
      Must surely yield the palm to that which France has;
    In short, he was a perfect Cavaliero,
    And to his very valet seemed a hero.

                        XXXIV.

    Then he was faithful too, as well as amorous;
      So that no sort of female could complain,
    Although they're now and then a little clamorous,
      He never put the pretty souls in pain;
    His heart was one of those which most enamour us,
      Wax to receive, and marble to retain:
    He was a lover of the good old school,
    Who still become more constant as they cool.

                        XXXV.

    No wonder such accomplishments should turn
      A female head, however sage and steady--
    With scarce a hope that Beppo could return,
      In law he was almost as good as dead, he
    Nor sent, nor wrote, nor showed the least concern,
      And she had waited several years already:
    And really if a man won't let us know
    That he's alive, he's dead--or should be so.

                        XXXVI.

    Besides, within the Alps, to every woman,
      (Although, God knows, it is a grievous sin,)
    'Tis, I may say, permitted to have two men;
      I can't tell who first brought the custom in,
    But "Cavalier Serventes" are quite common,
      And no one notices or cares a pin;
    An we may call this (not to say the worst)
    A second marriage which corrupts the first.

                        XXXVII.

    The word was formerly a "Cicisbeo,"
      But that is now grown vulgar and indecent;
    The Spaniards call the person a "Cortejo,"
      For the same mode subsists in Spain, though recent;
    In short it reaches from the Po to Teio,
      And may perhaps at last be o'er the sea sent:
    But Heaven preserve Old England from such courses!
    Or what becomes of damage and divorces?

                        XXXVIII.

    However, I still think, with all due deference
      To the fair single part of the creation,
    That married ladies should preserve the preference
      In tete a  tete or general conversation--
    And this I say without peculiar reference
      To England, France, or any other nation--
    Because they know the world, and are at ease,
    And being natural, naturally please.

                        XXXIX.

    'Tis true, your budding Miss is very charming,
      But shy and awkward at first coming out,
    So much alarmed, that she is quite alarming,
      All Giggle, Blush; half Pertness, and half Pout;
    And glancing at Mamma, for fear there's harm in
      What you, she, it, or they, may be about:
    The Nursery still lisps out in all they utter--
    Besides, they always smell of bread and butter.

                        XL.

    But "Cavalier Servente" is the phrase
      Used in politest circles to express
    This supernumerary slave, who stays
      Close to the lady as a part of dress,
    Her word the only law which he obeys.
      His is no sinecure, as you may guess;
    Coach, servants, gondola, he goes to call,
    And carries fan and tippet, gloves and shawl.

                        XLI.

    With all its sinful doings, I must say,
      That Italy's a pleasant place to me,
    Who love to see the Sun shine every day,
      And vines (not nailed to walls) from tree to tree
    Festooned, much like the back scene of a play,
      Or melodrame, which people flock to see,
    When the first act is ended by a dance
    In vineyards copied from the South of France.

                        XLII.

    I like on Autumn evenings to ride out,
      Without being forced to bid my groom be sure
    My cloak is round his middle strapped about,
      Because the skies are not the most secure;
    I know too that, if stopped upon my route,
      Where the green alleys windingly allure,
    Reeling with grapes red wagons choke the way,--
    In England 'twould be dung, dust, or a dray.

                        XLIII.

    I also like to dine on becaficas,
      To see the Sun set, sure he'll rise to-morrow,
    Not through a misty morning twinkling weak as
      A drunken man's dead eye in maudlin sorrow,
    But with all Heaven t'himself; the day will break as
      Beauteous as cloudless, nor be forced to borrow
    That sort of farthing candlelight which glimmers
    Where reeking London's smoky cauldron simmers.

                        XLIV.

    I love the language, that soft bastard Latin,
      Which melts like kisses from a female mouth,
    And sounds as if it should be writ on satin,
      With syllables which breathe of the sweet South,
    And gentle liquids gliding all so pat in,
      That not a single accent seems uncouth,
    Like our harsh northern whistling, grunting guttural,
    Which we're obliged to hiss, and spit, and sputter all.

                        XLV.

    I like the women too (forgive my folly!),
      From the rich peasant cheek of ruddy bronze,
    And large black eyes that flash on you a volley
      Of rays that say a thousand things at once,
    To the high Dama's brow, more melancholy,
      But clear, and with a wild and liquid glance,
    Heart on her lips, and soul within her eyes,
    Soft as her clime, and sunny as her skies.

                        XLVI.

    Eve of the land which still is Paradise!
      Italian Beauty didst thou not inspire
    Raphael, who died in thy embrace, and vies
      With all we know of Heaven, or can desire,
    In what he hath bequeathed us?--in what guise,
      Though flashing from the fervour of the Lyre,
    Would words describe thy past and present glow,
    While yet Canova can create below?

                        XLVII.

    "England! with all thy faults I love thee still,"
      I said at Calais, and have not forgot it;
    I like to speak and lucubrate my fill;
      I like the government (but that is not it);
    I like the freedom of the press and quill;
      I like the Habeas Corpus (when we've got it);
    I like a Parliamentary debate,
    Particularly when 'tis not too late;

                        XLVIII.

    I like the taxes, when they're not too many;
      I like a seacoal fire, when not too dear;
    I like a beef-steak, too, as well as any;
      Have no objection to a pot of beer;
    I like the weather,--when it is not rainy,
      That is, I like two months of every year.
    And so God save the Regent, Church, and King!
    Which means that I like all and every thing.

                        XLIX.

    Our standing army, and disbanded seamen,
      Poor's rate, Reform, my own, the nation's debt,
    Our little riots just to show we're free men,
      Our trifling bankruptcies in the Gazette,
    Our cloudy climate, and our chilly women,
      All these I can forgive, and those forget,
    And greatly venerate our recent glories,
    And wish they were not owing to the Tories.

                        L.

    But to my tale of Laura,--for I find
      Digression is a sin, that by degrees
    Becomes exceeding tedious to my mind,
      And, therefore, may the reader too displease--
    The gentle reader, who may wax unkind,
      And caring little for the Author's ease,
    Insist on knowing what he means--a hard
    And hapless situation for a Bard.

                        LI.

    Oh! that I had the art of easy writing
      What should be easy reading! could I scale
    Parnassus, where the Muses sit inditing
      Those pretty poems never known to fail,
    How quickly would I print (the world delighting)
      A Grecian, Syrian, or Assyrian tale;
    And sell you, mixed with western Sentimentalism,
    Some samples of the finest Orientalism.

                        LII.

    But I am but a nameless sort of person,
      (A broken Dandy lately on my travels)
    And take for rhyme, to hook my rambling verse on,
      The first that Walker's Lexicon unravels,
    And when I can't find that, I put a worse on,
      Not caring as I ought for critics' cavils;
    I've half a mind to tumble down to prose,
    But verse is more in fashion--so here goes!

                        LIII.

    The Count and Laura made their new arrangement,
      Which lasted, as arrangements sometimes do,
    For half a dozen years without estrangement;
      They had their little differences, too;
    Those jealous whiffs, which never any change meant;
      In such affairs there probably are few
    Who have not had this pouting sort of squabble,
    From sinners of high station to the rabble.

                        LIV.

    But, on the whole, they were a happy pair,
      As happy as unlawful love could make them;
    The gentleman was fond, the lady fair,
      Their chains so slight, 'twas not worth while to break them:
    The World beheld them with indulgent air;
      The pious only wished "the Devil take them!"
    He took them not; he very often waits,
    And leaves old sinners to be young ones' baits.

                        LV.

    But they were young: Oh! what without our Youth
      Would Love be! What would Youth be without Love!
    Youth lends its joy, and sweetness, vigour, truth,
      Heart, soul, and all that seems as from above;
    But, languishing with years, it grows uncouth--
      One of few things Experience don't improve;
    Which is, perhaps, the reason why old fellows
    Are always so preposterously jealous.

                        LVI.

    It was the Carnival, as I have said
      Some six and thirty stanzas back, and so
    Laura the usual preparations made,
      Which you do when your mind's made up to go
    To-night to Mrs. Boehm's masquerade,
      Spectator, or Partaker in the show;
    The only difference known between the cases
    Is--here, we have six weeks of "varnished faces."

                        LVII.

    Laura, when dressed, was (as I sang before)
      A pretty woman as was ever seen,
    Fresh as the Angel o'er a new inn door,
      Or frontispiece of a new Magazine,
    With all the fashions which the last month wore,
      Coloured, and silver paper leaved between
    That and the title-page, for fear the Press
    Should soil with parts of speech the parts of dress.

                        LVIII.

    They went to the Ridotto; 'tis a hall
      Where People dance, and sup, and dance again;
    Its proper name, perhaps, were a masqued ball,
      But that's of no importance to my strain;
    'Tis (on a smaller scale) like our Vauxhall,
      Excepting that it can't be spoilt by rain;
    The company is "mixed" (the phrase I quote is
    As much as saying, they're below your notice);

                        LIX.

    For a "mixed company" implies that, save
      Yourself and friends, and half a hundred more,
    Whom you may bow to without looking grave,
      The rest are but a vulgar set, the Bore
    Of public places, where they basely brave
      The fashionable stare of twenty score
    Of well-bred persons, called "The World;" but I,
    Although I know them, really don't know why.

                        LX.

    This is the case in England; at least was
      During the dynasty of Dandies, now
    Perchance succeeded by some other class
      Of imitated Imitators:--how
    Irreparably soon decline, alas!
      The Demagogues of fashion: all below
    Is frail; how easily the world is lost
    By Love, or War, and, now and then,--by Frost!

                        LXI.

    Crushed was Napoleon by the northern Thor,
      Who knocked his army down with icy hammer,
    Stopped by the Elements--like a Whaler--or
      A blundering novice in his new French grammar;
    Good cause had he to doubt the chance of war,
      And as for Fortune--but I dare not d--n her,
    Because, were I to ponder to Infinity,
    The more I should believe in her Divinity.

                        LXII.

    She rules the present, past, and all to be yet,
      She gives us luck in lotteries, love, and marriage;
    I cannot say that she's done much for me yet;
      Not that I mean her bounties to disparage,
    We've not yet closed accounts, and we shall see yet
      How much she'll make amends for past miscarriage;
    Meantime the Goddess I'll no more importune,
    Unless to thank her when she's made my fortune.

                        LXIII.

    To turn,--and to return;--the Devil take it!
      This story slips for ever through my fingers,
    Because, just as the stanza likes to make it,
      It needs must be--and so it rather lingers;
    This form of verse began, I can't well break it,
      But must keep time and tune like public singers;
    But if I once get through my present measure,
    I'll take another when I'm next at leisure.

                        LXIV.

    They went to the Ridotto ('tis a place
      To which I mean to go myself to-morrow,
    Just to divert my thoughts a little space
      Because I'm rather hippish, and may borrow
    Some spirits, guessing at what kind of face
      May lurk beneath each mask; and as my sorrow
    Slackens its pace sometimes, I'll make, or find,
    Something shall leave it half an hour behind.)

                        LXV.

    Now Laura moves along the joyous crowd,
      Smiles in her eyes, and simpers on her lips;
    To some she whispers, others speaks aloud;
      To some she curtsies, and to some she dips,
    Complains of warmth, and this complaint avowed,
      Her lover brings the lemonade, she sips;
    She then surveys, condemns, but pities still
    Her dearest friends for being dressed so ill.

                        LXVI.

    One has false curls, another too much paint,
      A third--where did she buy that frightful turban?
    A fourth's so pale she fears she's going to faint,
      A fifth's look's vulgar, dowdyish, and suburban,
    A sixth's white silk has got a yellow taint,
      A seventh's thin muslin surely will be her bane,
    And lo! an eighth appears,--"I'll see no more!"
    For fear, like Banquo's kings, they reach a score.

                        LXVII.

    Meantime, while she was thus at others gazing,
      Others were levelling their looks at her;
    She heard the men's half-whispered mode of praising
      And, till 'twas done, determined not to stir;
    The women only thought it quite amazing
      That, at her time of life, so many were
    Admirers still,--but "Men are so debased,
    Those brazen Creatures always suit their taste."

                        LXVIII.

    For my part, now, I ne'er could understand
      Why naughty women--but I won't discuss
    A thing which is a scandal to the land,
      I only don't see why it should be thus;
    And if I were but in a gown and band,
      Just to entitle me to make a fuss,
    I'd preach on this till Wilberforce and Romilly
    Should quote in their next speeches from my homily.

                        LXIX.

    While Laura thus was seen, and seeing, smiling,
      Talking, she knew not why, and cared not what,
    So that her female friends, with envy broiling,
      Beheld her airs, and triumph, and all that;
    And well-dressed males still kept before her filing,
      And passing bowed and mingled with her chat;
    More than the rest one person seemed to stare
    With pertinacity that's rather rare.

                        LXX.

    He was a Turk, the colour of mahogany;
      And Laura saw him, and at first was glad,
    Because the Turks so much admire philogyny,
      Although their usage of their wives is sad;
    'Tis said they use no better than a dog any
      Poor woman, whom they purchase like a pad:
    They have a number, though they ne'er exhibit 'em,
    Four wives by law, and concubines "ad libitum."

                        LXXI.

    They lock them up, and veil, and guard them daily,
      They scarcely can behold their male relations,
    So that their moments do not pass so gaily
      As is supposed the case with northern nations;
    Confinement, too, must make them look quite palely;
      And as the Turks abhor long conversations,
    Their days are either passed in doing nothing,
    Or bathing, nursing, making love, and clothing.

                        LXXII.

    They cannot read, and so don't lisp in criticism;
      Nor write, and so they don't affect the Muse;
    Were never caught in epigram or witticism,
      Have no romances, sermons, plays, reviews,--
    In Harams learning soon would make a pretty schism,
      But luckily these Beauties are no "Blues;"
    No bustling Botherby have they to show 'em
    "That charming passage in the last new poem:"

                        LXXIII.

    No solemn, antique gentleman of rhyme,
      Who having angled all his life for Fame,
    And getting but a nibble at a time,
      Still fussily keeps fishing on, the same
    Small "Triton of the minnows," the sublime
      Of Mediocrity, the furious tame,
    The Echo's echo, usher of the school
    Of female wits, boy bards--in short, a fool!

                        LXXIV.

    A stalking oracle of awful phrase,
      The approving "Good!" (by no means good in law)
    Humming like flies around the newest blaze,
      The bluest of bluebottles you e'er saw,
    Teasing with blame, excruciating with praise,
      Gorging the little fame he gets all raw,
    Translating tongues he knows not even by letter,
    And sweating plays so middling, bad were better.

                        LXXV.

    One hates an author that's all author--fellows
      In foolscap uniforms turned up with ink,
    So very anxious, clever, fine, and jealous,
      One don't know what to say to them, or think,
    Unless to puff them with a pair of bellows;
      Of Coxcombry's worst coxcombs e'en the pink
    Are preferable to these shreds of paper,
    These unquenched snuffings of the midnight taper.

                        LXXVI.

    Of these same we see several, and of others.
      Men of the world, who know the World like Men,
    Scott, Rogers, Moore, and all the better brothers,
      Who think of something else besides the pen;
    But for the children of the "Mighty Mother's,"
      The would-be wits, and can't-be gentlemen,
    I leave them to their daily "tea is ready,"
    Smug coterie, and literary lady.

                        LXXVII.

    The poor dear Mussulwomen whom I mention
      Have none of these instructive pleasant people,
    And one would seem to them a new invention,
      Unknown as bells within a Turkish steeple;
    I think 'twould almost be worth while to pension
      (Though best-sown projects very often reap ill)
    A missionary author--just to preach
    Our Christian usage of the parts of speech.

                        LXXVIII.

    No Chemistry for them unfolds her gases,
      No Metaphysics are let loose in lectures,
    No Circulating Library amasses
      Religious novels, moral tales, and strictures
    Upon the living manners, as they pass us;
      No Exhibition glares with annual pictures;
    They stare not on the stars from out their attics,
    Nor deal (thank God for that!) in Mathematics.

                        LXXIX.

    Why I thank God for that is no great matter,
      I have my reasons, you no doubt suppose,
    And as, perhaps, they would not highly flatter,
      I'll keep them for my life (to come) in prose;
    I fear I have a little turn for Satire,
      And yet methinks the older that one grows
    Inclines us more to laugh than scold, though Laughter
    Leaves us so doubly serious shortly after.

                        LXXX.

    Oh, Mirth and Innocence! Oh, Milk and Water!
      Ye happy mixtures of more happy days!
    In these sad centuries of sin and slaughter,
      Abominable Man no more allays
    His thirst with such pure beverage. No matter,
      I love you both, and both shall have my praise:
    Oh, for old Saturn's reign of sugar-candy!---
    Meantime I drink to your return in brandy.

                        LXXXI.

    Our Laura's Turk still kept his eyes upon her,
      Less in the Mussulman than Christian way,
    Which seems to say, "Madam, I do you honour,
      And while I please to stare, you'll please to stay."
    Could staring win a woman, this had won her,
      But Laura could not thus be led astray;
    She had stood fire too long and well, to boggle
    Even at this Stranger's most outlandish ogle.

                        LXXXII.

    The morning now was on the point of breaking,
      A turn of time at which I would advise
    Ladies who have been dancing, or partaking
      In any other kind of exercise,
    To make their preparations for forsaking
      The ball-room ere the Sun begins to rise,
    Because when once the lamps and candles fail,
    His blushes make them look a little pale.

                        LXXXIII.

    I've seen some balls and revels in my time,
      And stayed them over for some silly reason,
    And then I looked (I hope it was no crime)
      To see what lady best stood out the season;
    And though I've seen some thousands in their prime
      Lovely and pleasing, and who still may please on,
    I never saw but one (the stars withdrawn)
    Whose bloom could after dancing dare the Dawn.

                        LXXXIV.

    The name of this Aurora I'll not mention,
      Although I might, for she was nought to me
    More than that patent work of God's invention,
      A charming woman, whom we like to see;
    But writing names would merit reprehension,
      Yet if you like to find out this fair She,
    At the next London or Parisian ball
    You still may mark her cheek, out-blooming all.

                        LXXXV.

    Laura, who knew it would not do at all
      To meet the daylight after seven hours' sitting
    Among three thousand people at a ball,
      To make her curtsey thought it right and fitting;
    The Count was at her elbow with her shawl,
      And they the room were on the point of quitting,
    When lo! those cursed Gondoliers had got
    Just in the very place where they should not.

                        LXXXVI.

    In this they're like our coachmen, and the cause
      Is much the same--the crowd, and pulling, hauling,
    With blasphemies enough to break their jaws,
      They make a never intermitted bawling.
    At home, our Bow-street gem'men keep the laws,
      And here a sentry stands within your calling;
    But for all that, there is a deal of swearing,
    And nauseous words past mentioning or bearing.

                        LXXXVII.

    The Count and Laura found their boat at last,
      And homeward floated o'er the silent tide,
    Discussing all the dances gone and past;
      The dancers and their dresses, too, beside;
    Some little scandals eke; but all aghast
      (As to their palace-stairs the rowers glide)
    Sate Laura by the side of her adorer,
    When lo! the Mussulman was there before her!

                        LXXXVIII.

    "Sir," said the Count, with brow exceeding grave,
      "Your unexpected presence here will make
    It necessary for myself to crave
      Its import? But perhaps 'tis a mistake;
    I hope it is so; and, at once to waive
      All compliment, I hope so for your sake;
    You understand my meaning, or you shall."
    "Sir," (quoth the Turk) "'tis no mistake at all:

                        LXXXIX.

    "That Lady is my wife!" Much wonder paints
      The lady's changing cheek, as well it might;
    But where an Englishwoman sometimes faints,
      Italian females don't do so outright;
    They only call a little on their Saints,
      And then come to themselves, almost, or quite;
    Which saves much hartshorn, salts, and sprinkling faces,
    And cutting stays, as usual in such cases.

                        XC.

    She said,--what could she say? Why, not a word;
      But the Count courteously invited in
    The Stranger, much appeased by what he heard:
      "Such things, perhaps, we'd best discuss within,"
    Said he; "don't let us make ourselves absurd
      In public, by a scene, nor raise a din,
    For then the chief and only satisfaction
    Will be much quizzing on the whole transaction."

                        XCI.

    They entered, and for Coffee called--it came,
      A beverage for Turks and Christians both,
    Although the way they make it's not the same.
      Now Laura, much recovered, or less loth
    To speak, cries "Beppo! what's your pagan name?
      Bless me! your beard is of amazing growth!
    And how came you to keep away so long?
    Are you not sensible 'twas very wrong?

                        XCII.

    "And are you really, truly, now a Turk?
      With any other women did you wive?
    Is't true they use their fingers for a fork?
      Well, that's the prettiest Shawl--as I'm alive!
    You'll give it me? They say you eat no pork.
      And how so many years did you contrive
    To--Bless me! did I ever? No, I never
    Saw a man grown so yellow! How's your liver?

                        XCIII.

    "Beppo! that beard of yours becomes you not;
      It shall be shaved before you're a day older:
    Why do you wear it? Oh! I had forgot--
      Pray don't you think the weather here is colder?
    How do I look? You shan't stir from this spot
      In that queer dress, for fear that some beholder
    Should find you out, and make the story known.
    How short your hair is! Lord! how grey it's grown!"

                        XCIV.

    What answer Beppo made to these demands
      Is more than I know. He was cast away
    About where Troy stood once, and nothing stands;
      Became a slave of course, and for his pay
    Had bread and bastinadoes, till some bands
      Of pirates landing in a neighbouring bay,
    He joined the rogues and prospered, and became
    A renegade of indifferent fame.

                        XCV.

    But he grew rich, and with his riches grew so
      Keen the desire to see his home again,
    He thought himself in duty bound to do so,
      And not be always thieving on the main;
    Lonely he felt, at times, as Robin Crusoe,
      And so he hired a vessel come from Spain,
    Bound for Corfu: she was a fine polacca,
    Manned with twelve hands, and laden with tobacco.

                        XCVI.

    Himself, and much (heaven knows how gotten!) cash,
      He then embarked, with risk of life and limb,
    And got clear off, although the attempt was rash;
      He said that Providence protected him--
    For my part, I say nothing--lest we clash
      In our opinions:--well--the ship was trim,
    Set sail, and kept her reckoning fairly on,
    Except three days of calm when off Cape Bonn.

                        XCVII.

    They reached the Island, he transferred his lading,
      And self and live stock to another bottom,
    And passed for a true Turkey-merchant, trading
      With goods of various names--but I've forgot 'em.
    However, he got off by this evading,
      Or else the people would perhaps have shot him;
    And thus at Venice landed to reclaim
    His wife, religion, house, and Christian name.

                        XCVIII.

    His wife received, the Patriarch re-baptised him,
      (He made the Church a present, by the way;)
    He then threw off the garments which disguised him,
      And borrowed the Count's smallclothes for a day:
    His friends the more for his long absence prized him,
      Finding he'd wherewithal to make them gay,
    With dinners, where he oft became the laugh of them,
    For stories--but I don't believe the half of them.

                        XCIX.

    Whate'er his youth had suffered, his old age
      With wealth and talking made him some amends;
    Though Laura sometimes put him in a rage,
      I've heard the Count and he were always friends.
    My pen is at the bottom of a page,
      Which being finished, here the story ends:
    'Tis to be wished it had been sooner done,
    But stories somehow lengthen when begun.

                            ODE ON VENICE

                        I.

    Oh Venice! Venice! when thy marble walls
      Are level with the waters, there shall be
    A cry of nations o'er thy sunken halls,
      A loud lament along the sweeping sea!
    If I, a northern wanderer, weep for thee,
    What should thy sons do?--anything but weep:
    And yet they only murmur in their sleep.
    In contrast with their fathers--as the slime,
    The dull green ooze of the receding deep,
    Is with the dashing of the spring-tide foam,
    That drives the sailor shipless to his home,
    Are they to those that were; and thus they creep,
    Crouching and crab-like, through their sapping streets.
    Oh! agony--that centuries should reap
    No mellower harvest! Thirteen hundred years
    Of wealth and glory turned to dust and tears;
    And every monument the stranger meets,
    Church, palace, pillar, as a mourner greets;
    And even the Lion all subdued appears,
    And the harsh sound of the barbarian drum,
    With dull and daily dissonance, repeats
    The echo of thy Tyrant's voice along
    The soft waves, once all musical to song,
    That heaved beneath the moonlight with the throng
    Of gondolas--and to the busy hum
    Of cheerful creatures, whose most sinful deeds
    Were but the overbeating of the heart,
    And flow of too much happiness, which needs
    The aid of age to turn its course apart
    From the luxuriant and voluptuous flood
    Of sweet sensations, battling with the blood.
    But these are better than the gloomy errors,
    The weeds of nations in their last decay,
    When Vice walks forth with her unsoftened terrors,
    And Mirth is madness, and but smiles to slay;
    And Hope is nothing but a false delay,
    The sick man's lightning half an hour ere Death,
    When Faintness, the last mortal birth of Pain,
    And apathy of limb, the dull beginning
    Of the cold staggering race which Death is winning,
    Steals vein by vein and pulse by pulse away;
    Yet so relieving the o'er-tortured clay,
    To him appears renewal of his breath,
    And freedom the mere numbness of his chain;
    And then he talks of Life, and how again
    He feels his spirit soaring--albeit weak,
    And of the fresher air, which he would seek;
    And as he whispers knows not that he gasps,
    That his thin finger feels not what it clasps,
    And so the film comes o'er him--and the dizzy
    Chamber swims round and round--and shadows busy,
    At which he vainly catches, flit and gleam,
    Till the last rattle chokes the strangled scream,
    And all is ice and blackness,--and the earth
    That which it was the moment ere our birth.

                        II.

    There is no hope for nations!--Search the page
      Of many thousand years--the daily scene,
    The flow and ebb of each recurring age,
      The everlasting to be which hath been,
      Hath taught us nought or little: still we lean
    On things that rot beneath our weight, and wear
    Our strength away in wrestling with the air;
    For't is our nature strikes us down: the beasts
    Slaughtered in hourly hecatombs for feasts
    Are of as high an order--they must go
    Even where their driver goads them, though to slaughter.
    Ye men, who pour your blood for kings as water,
    What have they given your children in return?
    A heritage of servitude and woes,
    A blindfold bondage, where your hire is blows.
    What! do not yet the red-hot ploughshares burn,
    O'er which you stumble in a false ordeal,
    And deem this proof of loyalty the real;
    Kissing the hand that guides you to your scars,
    And glorying as you tread the glowing bars?
    All that your Sires have left you, all that Time
    Bequeaths of free, and History of sublime,
    Spring from a different theme!--Ye see and read,
    Admire and sigh, and then succumb and bleed!
    Save the few spirits who, despite of all,
    And worse than all, the sudden crimes engendered
    By the down-thundering of the prison-wall,
    And thirst to swallow the sweet waters tendered,
    Gushing from Freedom's fountains--when the crowd,
    Maddened with centuries of drought, are loud,
    And trample on each other to obtain
    The cup which brings oblivion of a chain
    Heavy and sore,--in which long yoked they ploughed
    The sand,--or if there sprung the yellow grain,
    'Twas not for them, their necks were too much bowed,
    And their dead palates chewed the cud of pain:--
    Yes! the few spirits--who, despite of deeds
    Which they abhor, confound not with the cause
    Those momentary starts from Nature's laws,
    Which, like the pestilence and earthquake, smite
    But for a term, then pass, and leave the earth
    With all her seasons to repair the blight
    With a few summers, and again put forth
    Cities and generations--fair, when free--
    For, Tyranny, there blooms no bud for thee!

                        III.

    Glory and Empire! once upon these towers
      With Freedom--godlike Triad! how you sate!
    The league of mightiest nations, in those hours
      When Venice was an envy, might abate,
      But did not quench, her spirit--in her fate
    All were enwrapped: the feasted monarchs knew
      And loved their hostess, nor could learn to hate,
    Although they humbled--with the kingly few
    The many felt, for from all days and climes
    She was the voyager's worship;--even her crimes
    Were of the softer order, born of Love--
    She drank no blood, nor fattened on the dead,
    But gladdened where her harmless conquests spread;
    For these restored the Cross, that from above
    Hallowed her sheltering banners, which incessant
    Flew between earth and the unholy Crescent,
    Which, if it waned and dwindled, Earth may thank
    The city it has clothed in chains, which clank
    Now, creaking in the ears of those who owe
    The name of Freedom to her glorious struggles;
    Yet she but shares with them a common woe,
    And called the "kingdom" of a conquering foe,--
    But knows what all--and, most of all, we know--
    With what set gilded terms a tyrant juggles!

                        IV.

    The name of Commonwealth is past and gone
      O'er the three fractions of the groaning globe;
    Venice is crushed, and Holland deigns to own
      A sceptre, and endures the purple robe;
    If the free Switzer yet bestrides alone
    His chainless mountains, 't is but for a time,
    For Tyranny of late is cunning grown,
    And in its own good season tramples down
    The sparkles of our ashes. One great clime,
    Whose vigorous offspring by dividing ocean
    Are kept apart and nursed in the devotion
    Of Freedom, which their fathers fought for, and
    Bequeathed--a heritage of heart and hand,
    And proud distinction from each other land,
    Whose sons must bow them at a Monarch's motion,
    As if his senseless sceptre were a wand
    Full of the magic of exploded science--
    Still one great clime, in full and free defiance,
    Yet rears her crest, unconquered and sublime,
    Above the far Atlantic!--She has taught
    Her Esau-brethren that the haughty flag,
    The floating fence of Albion's feebler crag,
    May strike to those whose red right hands have bought
    Rights cheaply earned with blood.--Still, still, for ever
    Better, though each man's life-blood were a river,
    That it should flow, and overflow, than creep
    Through thousand lazy channels in our veins,
    Dammed like the dull canal with locks and chains,
    And moving, as a sick man in his sleep,
    Three paces, and then faltering:--better be
    Where the extinguished Spartans still are free,
    In their proud charnel of Thermopylae,
    Than stagnate in our marsh,--or o'er the deep
    Fly, and one current to the ocean add,
    One spirit to the souls our fathers had,
    One freeman more, America, to thee!
         
                                 MAZEPPA

                        I.

    'Twas after dread Pultowa's day,
      When Fortune left the royal Swede--
    Around a slaughtered army lay,
      No more to combat and to bleed.
    The power and glory of the war,
      Faithless as their vain votaries, men,
    Had passed to the triumphant Czar,
      And Moscow's walls were safe again--
    Until a day more dark and drear,
    And a more memorable year,
    Should give to slaughter and to shame
    A mightier host and haughtier name;
    A greater wreck, a deeper fall,
    A shock to one--a thunderbolt to all.

                        II.

    Such was the hazard of the die;
    The wounded Charles was taught to fly
    By day and night through field and flood,
    Stained with his own and subjects' blood;
    For thousands fell that flight to aid:
    And not a voice was heard to upbraid
    Ambition in his humbled hour,
    When Truth had nought to dread from Power.
    His horse was slain, and Gieta gave
    His own--and died the Russians' slave.
    This, too, sinks after many a league
    Of well-sustained, but vain fatigue;
    And in the depth of forests darkling,
    The watch-fires in the distance sparkling--
      The beacons of surrounding foes--
    A King must lay his limbs at length.
      Are these the laurels and repose
    For which the nations strain their strength?
    They laid him by a savage tree,
    In outworn Nature's agony;
    His wounds were stiff, his limbs were stark;
    The heavy hour was chill and dark;
    The fever in his blood forbade
    A transient slumber's fitful aid:
    And thus it was; but yet through all,
    Kinglike the monarch bore his fall,
    And made, in this extreme of ill,
    His pangs the vassals of his will:
    All silent and subdued were they.
    As once the nations round him lay.

                        III.

    A band of chiefs!--alas! how few,
      Since but the fleeting of a day
    Had thinned it; but this wreck was true
      And chivalrous: upon the clay
    Each sate him down, all sad and mute,
      Beside his monarch and his steed;
    For danger levels man and brute,
      And all are fellows in their need.
    Among the rest, Mazeppa made
    His pillow in an old oak's shade--
    Himself as rough, and scarce less old,
    The Ukraine's Hetman, calm and bold;
    But first, outspent with this long course,
    The Cossack prince rubbed down his horse,
    And made for him a leafy bed,
      And smoothed his fetlocks and his mane,
      And slacked his girth, and stripped his rein,
    And joyed to see how well he fed;
    For until now he had the dread
    His wearied courser might refuse
    To browse beneath the midnight dews:
    But he was hardy as his lord,
    And little cared for bed and board;
    But spirited and docile too,
    Whate'er was to be done, would do.
    Shaggy and swift, and strong of limb,
    All Tartar-like he carried him;
    Obeyed his voice, and came to call,
    And knew him in the midst of all:
    Though thousands were around,--and Night,
    Without a star, pursued her flight,--
    That steed from sunset until dawn
    His chief would follow like a fawn.

                        IV.

    This done, Mazeppa spread his cloak,
    And laid his lance beneath his oak,
    Felt if his arms in order good
    The long day's march had well withstood--
    If still the powder filled the pan,
      And flints unloosened kept their lock--
    His sabre's hilt and scabbard felt,
    And whether they had chafed his belt;
    And next the venerable man,
    From out his havresack and can,
      Prepared and spread his slender stock;
    And to the Monarch and his men
    The whole or portion offered then
    With far less of inquietude
    Than courtiers at a banquet would.
    And Charles of this his slender share
    With smiles partook a moment there,
    To force of cheer a greater show,
    And seem above both wounds and woe;--
    And then he said--"Of all our band,
    Though firm of heart and strong of hand,
    In skirmish, march, or forage, none
    Can less have said or more have done
    Than thee, Mazeppa! On the earth
    So fit a pair had never birth,
    Since Alexander's days till now,
    As thy Bucephalus and thou:
    All Scythia's fame to thine should yield
    For pricking on o'er flood and field."
    Mazeppa answered--"Ill betide
    The school wherein I learned to ride!"
    Quoth Charles--"Old Hetman, wherefore so,
    Since thou hast learned the art so well?"
    Mazeppa said--"'Twere long to tell;
    And we have many a league to go,
    With every now and then a blow,
    And ten to one at least the foe,
    Before our steeds may graze at ease,
    Beyond the swift Borysthenes:
    And, Sire, your limbs have need of rest,
    And I will be the sentinel
    Of this your troop."--"But I request,"
    Said Sweden's monarch, "thou wilt tell
    This tale of thine, and I may reap,
    Perchance, from this the boon of sleep;
    For at this moment from my eyes
    The hope of present slumber flies."

    "Well, Sire, with such a hope, I'll track
    My seventy years of memory back:
    I think 'twas in my twentieth spring,--
    Aye 'twas,--when Casimir was king--
    John Casimir,--I was his page
    Six summers, in my earlier age:
    A learned monarch, faith! was he,
    And most unlike your Majesty;
    He made no wars, and did not gain
    New realms to lose them back again;
    And (save debates in Warsaw's diet)
    He reigned in most unseemly quiet;
    Not that he had no cares to vex;
    He loved the Muses and the Sex;
    And sometimes these so froward are,
    They made him wish himself at war;
    But soon his wrath being o'er, he took
    Another mistress--or new book:
    And then he gave prodigious fetes--
    All Warsaw gathered round his gates
    To gaze upon his splendid court,
    And dames, and chiefs, of princely port.
    He was the Polish Solomon,
    So sung his poets, all but one,
    Who, being unpensioned, made a satire,
    And boasted that he could not flatter.
    It was a court of jousts and mimes,
    Where every courtier tried at rhymes;
    Even I for once produced some verses,
    And signed my odes 'Despairing Thyrsis.'
    There was a certain Palatine,
      A Count of far and high descent,
    Rich as a salt or silver mine;
    And he was proud, ye may divine,
      As if from Heaven he had been sent;
    He had such wealth in blood and ore
      As few could match beneath the throne;
    And he would gaze upon his store,
    And o'er his pedigree would pore,
    Until by some confusion led,
    Which almost looked like want of head,
      He thought their merits were his own.
    His wife was not of this opinion;
      His junior she by thirty years,
    Grew daily tired of his dominion;
      And, after wishes, hopes, and fears,
      To Virtue a few farewell tears,
    A restless dream or two--some glances
    At Warsaw's youth--some songs, and dances,
    Awaited but the usual chances,
    Those happy accidents which render
    The coldest dames so very tender,
    To deck her Count with titles given,
    'Tis said, as passports into Heaven;
    But, strange to say, they rarely boast
    Of these, who have deserved them most.

                        V.

    "I was a goodly stripling then;
      At seventy years I so may say,
    That there were few, or boys or men,
      Who, in my dawning time of day,
    Of vassal or of knight's degree,
    Could vie in vanities with me;
    For I had strength--youth--gaiety,
    A port, not like to this ye see,
    But smooth, as all is rugged now;
      For Time, and Care, and War, have ploughed
    My very soul from out my brow;
      And thus I should be disavowed
    By all my kind and kin, could they
    Compare my day and yesterday;
    This change was wrought, too, long ere age
    Had ta'en my features for his page:
    With years, ye know, have not declined
    My strength--my courage--or my mind,
    Or at this hour I should not be
    Telling old tales beneath a tree,
    With starless skies my canopy.
      But let me on: Theresa's form--
    Methinks it glides before me now,
    Between me and yon chestnut's bough,
      The memory is so quick and warm;
    And yet I find no words to tell
    The shape of her I loved so well:
    She had the Asiatic eye,
      Such as our Turkish neighbourhood
      Hath mingled with our Polish blood,
    Dark as above us is the sky;
    But through it stole a tender light,
    Like the first moonrise of midnight;
    Large, dark, and swimming in the stream,
    Which seemed to melt to its own beam;
    All love, half languor, and half fire,
    Like saints that at the stake expire,
    And lift their raptured looks on high,
    As though it were a joy to die.
    A brow like a midsummer lake,
      Transparent with the sun therein,
    When waves no murmur dare to make,
      And heaven beholds her face within.
    A cheek and lip--but why proceed?
      I loved her then, I love her still;
    And such as I am, love indeed
      In fierce extremes--in good and ill.
    But still we love even in our rage,
    And haunted to our very age
    With the vain shadow of the past,--
    As is Mazeppa to the last.

                        VI.

    "We met--we gazed--I saw, and sighed;
    She did not speak, and yet replied;
    There are ten thousand tones and signs
    We hear and see, but none defines--
    Involuntary sparks of thought,
    Which strike from out the heart o'erwrought,
    And form a strange intelligence,
    Alike mysterious and intense,
    Which link the burning chain that binds,
    Without their will, young hearts and minds;
    Conveying, as the electric wire,
    We know not how, the absorbing fire.
    I saw, and sighed--in silence wept,
    And still reluctant distance kept,
    Until I was made known to her,
    And we might then and there confer
    Without suspicion--then, even then,
      I longed, and was resolved to speak;
    But on my lips they died again,
      The accents tremulous and weak,
    Until one hour.--There is a game,
      A frivolous and foolish play,
      Wherewith we while away the day;
    It is--I have forgot the name--
    And we to this, it seems, were set,
    By some strange chance, which I forget:
    I recked not if I won or lost,
      It was enough for me to be
      So near to hear, and oh! to see
    The being whom I loved the most.
    I watched her as a sentinel,
    (May ours this dark night watch as well!)
      Until I saw, and thus it was,
    That she was pensive, nor perceived
    Her occupation, nor was grieved
    Nor glad to lose or gain; but still
    Played on for hours, as if her will
    Yet bound her to the place, though not
    That hers might be the winning lot.
      Then through my brain the thought did pass,
    Even as a flash of lightning there,
    That there was something in her air
    Which would not doom me to despair;
    And on the thought my words broke forth,
      All incoherent as they were;
    Their eloquence was little worth,
    But yet she listened--'tis enough--
      Who listens once will listen twice;
      Her heart, be sure, is not of ice--
    And one refusal no rebuff.

                        VII.

    "I loved, and was beloved again--
      They tell me, Sire, you never knew
      Those gentle frailties; if 'tis true,
    I shorten all my joy or pain;
    To you 'twould seem absurd as vain;
    But all men are not born to reign,
    Or o'er their passions, or as you
    Thus o'er themselves and nations too.
    I am--or rather was--a Prince,
      A chief of thousands, and could lead
      Them on where each would foremost bleed;
    But could not o'er myself evince
    The like control--But to resume:
      I loved, and was beloved again;
    In sooth, it is a happy doom,
      But yet where happiest ends in pain.--
    We met in secret, and the hour
    Which led me to that lady's bower
    Was fiery Expectation's dower.
    My days and nights were nothing--all
    Except that hour which doth recall,
    In the long lapse from youth to age,
      No other like itself: I'd give
      The Ukraine back again to live
    It o'er once more, and be a page,
    The happy page, who was the lord
    Of one soft heart, and his own sword,
    And had no other gem nor wealth,
    Save Nature's gift of Youth and Health.
    We met in secret--doubly sweet,
    Some say, they find it so to meet;
    I know not that--I would have given
      My life but to have called her mine
    In the full view of Earth and Heaven;
      For I did oft and long repine
    That we could only meet by stealth.

                        VIII.

    "For lovers there are many eyes,
      And such there were on us; the Devil
      On such occasions should be civil--
    The Devil!--I'm loth to do him wrong,
      It might be some untoward saint,
    Who would not be at rest too long,
      But to his pious bile gave vent--
    But one fair night, some lurking spies
    Surprised and seized us both.
    The Count was something more than wroth--
    I was unarmed; but if in steel,
    All cap-a-pie from head to heel,
    What 'gainst their numbers could I do?
    'Twas near his castle, far away
      From city or from succour near,
    And almost on the break of day;
    I did not think to see another,
      My moments seemed reduced to few;
    And with one prayer to Mary Mother,
      And, it may be, a saint or two,
    As I resigned me to my fate,
    They led me to the castle gate:
      Theresa's doom I never knew,
    Our lot was henceforth separate.
    An angry man, ye may opine,
    Was he, the proud Count Palatine;
    And he had reason good to be,
      But he was most enraged lest such
      An accident should chance to touch
    Upon his future pedigree;
    Nor less amazed, that such a blot
    His noble 'scutcheon should have got,
    While he was highest of his line;
      Because unto himself he seemed
      The first of men, nor less he deemed
    In others' eyes, and most in mine.
    'Sdeath! with a page--perchance a king
    Had reconciled him to the thing;
    But with a stripling of a page--
    I felt--but cannot paint his rage.

                        IX.

    "'Bring forth the horse!'--the horse was brought!
    In truth, he was a noble steed,
      A Tartar of the Ukraine breed,
    Who looked as though the speed of thought
    Were in his limbs; but he was wild,
      Wild as the wild deer, and untaught,
    With spur and bridle undefiled--
      'Twas but a day he had been caught;
    And snorting, with erected mane,
    And struggling fiercely, but in vain,
    In the full foam of wrath and dread
    To me the desert-born was led:
    They bound me on, that menial throng,
    Upon his back with many a thong;
    They loosed him with a sudden lash--
    Away!--away!--and on we dash!--
    Torrents less rapid and less rash.

                        X.

    "Away!--away!--My breath was gone,
    I saw not where he hurried on:
    'Twas scarcely yet the break of day,
    And on he foamed--away!--away!
    The last of human sounds which rose,
    As I was darted from my foes,
    Was the wild shout of savage laughter,
    Which on the wind came roaring after
    A moment from that rabble rout:
    With sudden wrath I wrenched my head,
      And snapped the cord, which to the mane
      Had bound my neck in lieu of rein,
    And, writhing half my form about,
    Howled back my curse; but 'midst the tread,
    The thunder of my courser's speed,
    Perchance they did not hear nor heed:
    It vexes me--for I would fain
    Have paid their insult back again.
    I paid it well in after days:
    There is not of that castle gate,
    Its drawbridge and portcullis' weight,
    Stone--bar--moat--bridge--or barrier left;
    Nor of its fields a blade of grass,
      Save what grows on a ridge of wall,
      Where stood the hearth-stone of the hall;
    And many a time ye there might pass,
    Nor dream that e'er the fortress was.
    I saw its turrets in a blaze,
    Their crackling battlements all cleft,
      And the hot lead pour down like rain
    From off the scorched and blackening roof,
    Whose thickness was not vengeance-proof.
      They little thought that day of pain,
    When launched, as on the lightning's flash,
    They bade me to destruction dash,
      That one day I should come again,
    With twice five thousand horse, to thank
      The Count for his uncourteous ride.
    They played me then a bitter prank,
      When, with the wild horse for my guide,
    They bound me to his foaming flank:
    At length I played them one as frank--
    For Time at last sets all things even--
      And if we do but watch the hour,
      There never yet was human power
    Which could evade, if unforgiven,
    The patient search and vigil long
    Of him who treasures up a wrong.

                        XI.

    "Away!--away!--my steed and I,
      Upon the pinions of the wind!
      All human dwellings left behind,
    We sped like meteors through the sky,
    When with its crackling sound the night
    Is chequered with the Northern light.
    Town--village--none were on our track,
      But a wild plain of far extent,
    And bounded by a forest black;
      And, save the scarce seen battlement
    On distant heights of some strong hold,
    Against the Tartars built of old,
    No trace of man. The year before
    A Turkish army had marched o'er;
    And where the Spahi's hoof hath trod,
    The verdure flies the bloody sod:
    The sky was dull, and dim, and gray,
      And a low breeze crept moaning by--
      I could have answered with a sigh--
    But fast we fled,--away!--away!--
    And I could neither sigh nor pray;
    And my cold sweat-drops fell like rain
    Upon the courser's bristling mane;
    But, snorting still with rage and fear,
    He flew upon his far career:
    At times I almost thought, indeed,
    He must have slackened in his speed;
    But no--my bound and slender frame
      Was nothing to his angry might,
    And merely like a spur became:
    Each motion which I made to free
    My swoln limbs from their agony
      Increased his fury and affright:
    I tried my voice,--'twas faint and low--
    But yet he swerved as from a blow;
    And, starting to each accent, sprang
    As from a sudden trumpet's clang:
    Meantime my cords were wet with gore,
    Which, oozing through my limbs, ran o'er;
    And in my tongue the thirst became
    A something fierier far than flame.

                        XII.

    "We neared the wild wood--'twas so wide,
    I saw no bounds on either side:
    'Twas studded with old sturdy trees,
    That bent not to the roughest breeze
    Which howls down from Siberia's waste,
    And strips the forest in its haste,--
    But these were few and far between,
    Set thick with shrubs more young and green,
    Luxuriant with their annual leaves,
    Ere strown by those autumnal eyes
    That nip the forest's foliage dead,
    Discoloured with a lifeless red,
    Which stands thereon like stiffened gore
    Upon the slain when battle's o'er;
    And some long winter's night hath shed
    Its frost o'er every tombless head--
    So cold and stark--the raven's beak
    May peck unpierced each frozen cheek:
    'Twas a wild waste of underwood,
    And here and there a chestnut stood,
    The strong oak, and the hardy pine;
      But far apart--and well it were,
    Or else a different lot were mine--
      The boughs gave way, and did not tear
    My limbs; and I found strength to bear
    My wounds, already scarred with cold;
    My bonds forbade to loose my hold.
    We rustled through the leaves like wind,--
    Left shrubs, and trees, and wolves behind;
    By night I heard them on the track,
    Their troop came hard upon our back,
    With their long gallop, which can tire
    The hound's deep hate, and hunter's fire:
    Where'er we flew they followed on,
    Nor left us with the morning sun;
    Behind I saw them, scarce a rood,
    At day-break winding through the wood,
    And through the night had heard their feet
    Their stealing, rustling step repeat.
    Oh! how I wished for spear or sword,
    At least to die amidst the horde,
    And perish--if it must be so--
    At bay, destroying many a foe!
    When first my courser's race begun,
    I wished the goal already won;
    But now I doubted strength and speed:
    Vain doubt! his swift and savage breed
    Had nerved him like the mountain-roe--
    Nor faster falls the blinding snow
    Which whelms the peasant near the door
    Whose threshold he shall cross no more,
    Bewildered with the dazzling blast,
    Than through the forest-paths he passed--
    Untired, untamed, and worse than wild--
    All furious as a favoured child
    Balked of its wish; or--fiercer still--
    A woman piqued--who has her will!

                        XIII.

    "The wood was passed; 'twas more than noon,
    But chill the air, although in June;
    Or it might be my veins ran cold--
    Prolonged endurance tames the bold;
    And I was then not what I seem,
    But headlong as a wintry stream,
    And wore my feelings out before
    I well could count their causes o'er:
    And what with fury, fear, and wrath,
    The tortures which beset my path--
    Cold--hunger--sorrow--shame--distress--
    Thus bound in Nature's nakedness;
    Sprung from a race whose rising blood
    When stirred beyond its calmer mood,
    And trodden hard upon, is like
    The rattle-snake's, in act to strike--
    What marvel if this worn-out trunk
    Beneath its woes a moment sunk?
    The earth gave way, the skies rolled round,
    I seemed to sink upon the ground;
    But erred--for I was fastly bound.
    My heart turned sick, my brain grew sore,
    And throbbed awhile, then beat no more:
    The skies spun like a mighty wheel;
    I saw the trees like drunkards reel,
    And a slight flash sprang o'er my eyes,
    Which saw no farther. He who dies
    Can die no more than then I died,
    O'ertortured by that ghastly ride.
    I felt the blackness come and go,
      And strove to wake; but could not make
    My senses climb up from below:
    I felt as on a plank at sea,
    When all the waves that dash o'er thee,
    At the same time upheave and whelm,
    And hurl thee towards a desert realm.
    My undulating life was as
    The fancied lights that flitting pass
    Our shut eyes in deep midnight, when
    Fever begins upon the brain;
    But soon it passed, with little pain,
      But a confusion worse than such:
      I own that I should deem it much,
    Dying, to feel the same again;
    And yet I do suppose we must
    Feel far more ere we turn to dust!
    No matter! I have bared my brow
    Full in Death's face--before--and now.

                        XIV.

    "My thoughts came back. Where was I? Cold,
      And numb, and giddy: pulse by pulse
    Life reassumed its lingering hold,
    And throb by throb,--till grown a pang
      Which for a moment would convulse,
      My blood reflowed, though thick and chill;
    My ear with uncouth noises rang,
      My heart began once more to thrill;
    My sight returned, though dim; alas!
    And thickened, as it were, with glass.
    Methought the dash of waves was nigh;
    There was a gleam too of the sky,
    Studded with stars;--it is no dream;
    The wild horse swims the wilder stream!
    The bright broad river's gushing tide
    Sweeps, winding onward, far and wide,
    And we are half-way, struggling o'er
    To yon unknown and silent shore.
    The waters broke my hollow trance,
    And with a temporary strength
      My stiffened limbs were rebaptized.
    My courser's broad breast proudly braves,
    And dashes off the ascending waves,
    And onward we advance!
    We reach the slippery shore at length,
      A haven I but little prized,
    For all behind was dark and drear,
    And all before was night and fear.
    How many hours of night or day
    In those suspended pangs I lay,
    I could not tell; I scarcely knew
    If this were human breath I drew.

                        XV.

    "With glossy skin, and dripping mane,
      And reeling limbs, and reeking flank,
    The wild steed's sinewy nerves still strain
      Up the repelling bank.
    We gain the top: a boundless plain
    Spreads through the shadow of the night,
      And onward, onward, onward--seems,
      Like precipices in our dreams,
    To stretch beyond the sight;
    And here and there a speck of white,
      Or scattered spot of dusky green,
    In masses broke into the light,
    As rose the moon upon my right:
      But nought distinctly seen
    In the dim waste would indicate
    The omen of a cottage gate;
    No twinkling taper from afar
    Stood like a hospitable star;
    Not even an ignis-fatuus rose
    To make him merry with my woes:
      That very cheat had cheered me then!
    Although detected, welcome still,
    Reminding me, through every ill,
      Of the abodes of men.

                        XVI.

    "Onward we went--but slack and slow;
      His savage force at length o'erspent,
    The drooping courser, faint and low,
      All feebly foaming went:
    A sickly infant had had power
    To guide him forward in that hour!
      But, useless all to me,
    His new-born tameness nought availed--
    My limbs were bound; my force had failed,
      Perchance, had they been free.
    With feeble effort still I tried
    To rend the bonds so starkly tied,
      But still it was in vain;
    My limbs were only wrung the more,
    And soon the idle strife gave o'er,
      Which but prolonged their pain.
    The dizzy race seemed almost done,
    Although no goal was nearly won:
    Some streaks announced the coming sun--
      How slow, alas! he came!
    Methought that mist of dawning gray
    Would never dapple into day,
    How heavily it rolled away!
      Before the eastern flame
    Rose crimson, and deposed the stars,
    And called the radiance from their cars,
    And filled the earth, from his deep throne,
    With lonely lustre, all his own.

                        XVII.

    "Uprose the sun; the mists were curled
    Back from the solitary world
    Which lay around--behind--before.
    What booted it to traverse o'er
    Plain--forest--river? Man nor brute,
    Nor dint of hoof, nor print of foot,
    Lay in the wild luxuriant soil--
    No sign of travel, none of toil--
    The very air was mute:
    And not an insect's shrill small horn,
    Nor matin bird's new voice was borne
    From herb nor thicket. Many a werst,
    Panting as if his heart would burst,
    The weary brute still staggered on;
    And still we were--or seemed--alone:
    At length, while reeling on our way,
    Methought I heard a courser neigh,
    From out yon tuft of blackening firs.
    Is it the wind those branches stirs?
    No, no! from out the forest prance
      A trampling troop; I see them come!
    In one vast squadron they advance!
      I strove to cry--my lips were dumb!
    The steeds rush on in plunging pride;
    But where are they the reins to guide?
    A thousand horse, and none to ride!
    With flowing tail, and flying mane,
    Wide nostrils never stretched by pain,
    Mouths bloodless to the bit or rein,
    And feet that iron never shod,
    And flanks unscarred by spur or rod,
    A thousand horse, the wild, the free,
    Like waves that follow o'er the sea,
      Came thickly thundering on,
    As if our faint approach to meet!
    The sight re-nerved my courser's feet,
    A moment staggering, feebly fleet,
    A moment, with a faint low neigh,
      He answered, and then fell!
    With gasps and glazing eyes he lay,
      And reeking limbs immoveable,
        His first and last career is done!
    On came the troop--they saw him stoop,
      They saw me strangely bound along
      His back with many a bloody thong.
    They stop--they start--they snuff the air,
    Gallop a moment here and there,
    Approach, retire, wheel round and round,
    Then plunging back with sudden bound,
    Headed by one black mighty steed,
    Who seemed the Patriarch of his breed,
      Without a single speck or hair
    Of white upon his shaggy hide;
    They snort--they foam--neigh--swerve aside,
    And backward to the forest fly,
    By instinct, from a human eye.
      They left me there to my despair,
    Linked to the dead and stiffening wretch,
    Whose lifeless limbs beneath me stretch,
    Relieved from that unwonted weight,
    From whence I could not extricate
    Nor him nor me--and there we lay,
      The dying on the dead!
    I little deemed another day
      Would see my houseless, helpless head.

    "And there from morn to twilight bound,
    I felt the heavy hours toil round,
    With just enough of life to see
    My last of suns go down on me,
    In hopeless certainty of, mind,
    That makes us feel at length resigned
    To that which our foreboding years
    Present the worst and last of fears:
    Inevitable--even a boon,
    Nor more unkind for coming soon,
    Yet shunned and dreaded with such care,
    As if it only were a snare
      That Prudence might escape:
    At times both wished for and implored,
    At times sought with self-pointed sword,
    Yet still a dark and hideous close
    To even intolerable woes,
      And welcome in no shape.
    And, strange to say, the sons of pleasure,
    They who have revelled beyond measure
    In beauty, wassail, wine, and treasure,
    Die calm, or calmer, oft than he
    Whose heritage was Misery.
    For he who hath in turn run through
    All that was beautiful and new,
      Hath nought to hope, and nought to leave;
    And, save the future, (which is viewed
    Not quite as men are base or good,
    But as their nerves may be endued,)
      With nought perhaps to grieve:
    The wretch still hopes his woes must end,
    And Death, whom he should deem his friend,
    Appears, to his distempered eyes,
    Arrived to rob him of his prize,
    The tree of his new Paradise.
    To-morrow would have given him all,
    Repaid his pangs, repaired his fall;
    To-morrow would have been the first
    Of days no more deplored or curst,
    But bright, and long, and beckoning years,
    Seen dazzling through the mist of tears,
    Guerdon of many a painful hour;
    To-morrow would have given him power
    To rule--to shine--to smite--to save--
    And must it dawn upon his grave?

                        XVIII.

    "The sun was sinking--still I lay
      Chained to the chill and stiffening steed!
    I thought to mingle there our clay;
      And my dim eyes of death had need,
      No hope arose of being freed.
    I cast my last looks up the sky,
      And there between me and the sun
    I saw the expecting raven fly,
    Who scarce would wait till both should die,
      Ere his repast begun;
    He flew, and perched, then flew once more,
    And each time nearer than before;
    I saw his wing through twilight flit,
    And once so near me he alit
      I could have smote, but lacked the strength;
    But the slight motion of my hand,
    And feeble scratching of the sand,
    The exerted throat's faint struggling noise,
    Which scarcely could be called a voice,
      Together scared him off at length.
    I know no more--my latest dream
      Is something of a lovely star
      Which fixed my dull eyes from afar,
    And went and came with wandering beam,
    And of the cold--dull--swimming--dense
    Sensation of recurring sense,
    And then subsiding back to death,
    And then again a little breath,
    A little thrill--a short suspense,
      An icy sickness curdling o'er
    My heart, and sparks that crossed my brain--
    A gasp--a throb--a start of pain,
      A sigh--and nothing more.

                        XIX.

    "I woke--where was I?--Do I see
    A human face look down on me?
    And doth a roof above me close?
    Do these limbs on a couch repose?
    Is this a chamber where I lie?
    And is it mortal yon bright eye,
    That watches me with gentle glance?
      I closed my own again once more,
    As doubtful that my former trance
      Could not as yet be o'er.
    A slender girl, long-haired, and tall,
    Sate watching by the cottage wall.
    The sparkle of her eye I caught,
    Even with my first return of thought;
    For ever and anon she threw
      A prying, pitying glance on me
      With her black eyes so wild and free:
    I gazed, and gazed, until I knew
      No vision it could be,--
    But that I lived, and was released
    From adding to the vulture's feast:
    And when the Cossack maid beheld
    My heavy eyes at length unsealed,
    She smiled--and I essayed to speak,
      But failed--and she approached, and made
      With lip and finger signs that said,
    I must not strive as yet to break
    The silence, till my strength should be
    Enough to leave my accents free;
    And then her hand on mine she laid,
    And smoothed the pillow for my head,
    And stole along on tiptoe tread,
      And gently oped the door, and spake
    In whispers--ne'er was voice so sweet!
    Even music followed her light feet.
      But those she called were not awake,
    And she went forth; but, ere she passed,
    Another look on me she cast,
      Another sign she made, to say,
    That I had nought to fear, that all
    Were near, at my command or call,
      And she would not delay
    Her due return:--while she was gone,
    Methought I felt too much alone.

                        XX.

    "She came with mother and with sire--
    What need of more?--I will not tire
    With long recital of the rest,
    Since I became the Cossack's guest.
    They found me senseless on the plain,
      They bore me to the nearest hut,
    They brought me into life again--
    Me--one day o'er their realm to reign!
      Thus the vain fool who strove to glut
    His rage, refining on my pain,
      Sent me forth to the wilderness,
    Bound--naked--bleeding--and alone,
    To pass the desert to a throne,--
      What mortal his own doom may guess?
      Let none despond, let none despair!
    To-morrow the Borysthenes
    May see our coursers graze at ease
    Upon his Turkish bank,--and never
    Had I such welcome for a river
      As I shall yield when safely there.
    Comrades, good night!"--The Hetman threw
      His length beneath the oak-tree shade,
      With leafy couch already made--
    A bed nor comfortless nor new
    To him, who took his rest whene'er
    The hour arrived, no matter where:
      His eyes the hastening slumbers steep.
    And if ye marvel Charles forgot
    To thank his tale, he wondered not,--
      The King had been an hour asleep!

         "'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,
          And coming events cast their shadows before."

                            Campbell, .

                               DEDICATION.

    Lady! if for the cold and cloudy clime
      Where I was born, but where I would not die,
      Of the great Poet-Sire of Italy
    I dare to build the imitative rhyme,
    Harsh Runic copy of the South's sublime,
      Thou art the cause; and howsoever I
      Fall short of his immortal harmony,
    Thy gentle heart will pardon me the crime.
    Thou, in the pride of Beauty and of Youth,
       Spakest; and for thee to speak and be obeyed
    Are one; but only in the sunny South
      Such sounds are uttered, and such charms displayed,
    So sweet a language from so fair a mouth--
      Ah! to what effort would it not persuade?

                          THE PROPHECY OF DANTE.

                             CANTO THE FIRST.

    Once more in Man's frail world! which I had left
      So long that 'twas forgotten; and I feel
      The weight of clay again,--too soon bereft
    Of the Immortal Vision which could heal
      My earthly sorrows, and to God's own skies
      Lift me from that deep Gulf without repeal,
    Where late my ears rung with the damned cries
      Of Souls in hopeless bale; and from that place
      Of lesser torment, whence men may arise
    Pure from the fire to join the Angelic race;
      Midst whom my own bright Beatrice blessed
      My spirit with her light; and to the base
    Of the Eternal Triad! first, last, best,
      Mysterious, three, sole, infinite, great God!
      Soul universal! led the mortal guest,
    Unblasted by the Glory, though he trod
      From star to star to reach the almighty throne.
      Oh Beatrice! whose sweet limbs the sod
    So long hath pressed, and the cold marble stone,
      Thou sole pure Seraph of my earliest love,
      Love so ineffable, and so alone,
    That nought on earth could more my bosom move,
      And meeting thee in Heaven was but to meet
      That without which my Soul, like the arkless dove,
    Had wandered still in search of, nor her feet
      Relieved her wing till found; without thy light
      My Paradise had still been incomplete.
    Since my tenth sun gave summer to my sight
      Thou wert my Life, the Essence of my thought,
      Loved ere I knew the name of Love, and bright
    Still in these dim old eyes, now overwrought
      With the World's war, and years, and banishment,
      And tears for thee, by other woes untaught;
    For mine is not a nature to be bent
      By tyrannous faction, and the brawling crowd,
      And though the long, long conflict hath been spent
    In vain,--and never more, save when the cloud
      Which overhangs the Apennine my mind's eye
      Pierces to fancy Florence, once so proud
    Of me, can I return, though but to die,
      Unto my native soil,--they have not yet
      Quenched the old exile's spirit, stern and high.
    But the Sun, though not overcast, must set
      And the night cometh; I am old in days,
      And deeds, and contemplation, and have met
    Destruction face to face in all his ways.
      The World hath left me, what it found me, pure,
      And if I have not gathered yet its praise,
    I sought it not by any baser lure;
      Man wrongs, and Time avenges, and my name
      May form a monument not all obscure,
    Though such was not my Ambition's end or aim,
      To add to the vain-glorious list of those
      Who dabble in the pettiness of fame,
    And make men's fickle breath the wind that blows
      Their sail, and deem it glory to be classed
      With conquerors, and Virtue's other foes,
    In bloody chronicles of ages past.
      I would have had my Florence great and free;
      Oh Florence! Florence! unto me thou wast
    Like that Jerusalem which the Almighty He
      Wept over, "but thou wouldst not;" as the bird
      Gathers its young, I would have gathered thee
    Beneath a parent pinion, hadst thou heard
      My voice; but as the adder, deaf and fierce,
      Against the breast that cherished thee was stirred
    Thy venom, and my state thou didst amerce,
      And doom this body forfeit to the fire.
      Alas! how bitter is his country's curse
    To him who for that country would expire,
      But did not merit to expire by her,
      And loves her, loves her even in her ire.
    The day may come when she will cease to err,
      The day may come she would be proud to have
      The dust she dooms to scatter, and transfer
    Of him, whom she denied a home, the grave.
      But this shall not be granted; let my dust
      Lie where it falls; nor shall the soil which gave
    Me breath, but in her sudden fury thrust
      Me forth to breathe elsewhere, so reassume
      My indignant bones, because her angry gust
    Forsooth is over, and repealed her doom;
      No,--she denied me what was mine--my roof,
      And shall not have what is not hers--my tomb.
    Too long her armed wrath hath kept aloof
      The breast which would have bled for her, the heart
      That beat, the mind that was temptation proof,
    The man who fought, toiled, travelled, and each part
      Of a true citizen fulfilled, and saw
      For his reward the Guelf's ascendant art
    Pass his destruction even into a law.
      These things are not made for forgetfulness,
      Florence shall be forgotten first; too raw
    The wound, too deep the wrong, and the distress
      Of such endurance too prolonged to make
      My pardon greater, her injustice less,
    Though late repented; yet--yet for her sake
      I feel some fonder yearnings, and for thine,
      My own Beatrice, I would hardly take
    Vengeance upon the land which once was mine,
      And still is hallowed by thy dust's return,
      Which would protect the murderess like a shrine,
    And save ten thousand foes by thy sole urn.
      Though, like old Marius from Minturnae's marsh
      And Carthage ruins, my lone breast may burn
    At times with evil feelings hot and harsh,
      And sometimes the last pangs of a vile foe
      Writhe in a dream before me, and o'erarch
    My brow with hopes of triumph,--let them go!
      Such are the last infirmities of those
      Who long have suffered more than mortal woe,
    And yet being mortal still, have no repose
      But on the pillow of Revenge--Revenge,
      Who sleeps to dream of blood, and waking glows
    With the oft-baffled, slakeless thirst of change,
      When we shall mount again, and they that trod
      Be trampled on, while Death and Ate range
    O'er humbled heads and severed necks----Great God!
      Take these thoughts from me--to thy hands I yield
      My many wrongs, and thine Almighty rod
    Will fall on those who smote me,--be my Shield!
      As thou hast been in peril, and in pain,
      In turbulent cities, and the tented field--
    In toil, and many troubles borne in vain
      For Florence,--I appeal from her to Thee!
      Thee, whom I late saw in thy loftiest reign,
    Even in that glorious Vision, which to see
      And live was never granted until now,
      And yet thou hast permitted this to me.
    Alas! with what a weight upon my brow
      The sense of earth and earthly things come back,
      Corrosive passions, feelings dull and low,
    The heart's quick throb upon the mental rack,
      Long day, and dreary night; the retrospect
      Of half a century bloody and black,
    And the frail few years I may yet expect
      Hoary and hopeless, but less hard to bear,
      For I have been too long and deeply wrecked
    On the lone rock of desolate Despair,
      To lift my eyes more to the passing sail
      Which shuns that reef so horrible and bare;
    Nor raise my voice--for who would heed my wail?
      I am not of this people, nor this age,
      And yet my harpings will unfold a tale
    Which shall preserve these times when not a page
      Of their perturbed annals could attract
      An eye to gaze upon their civil rage,
    Did not my verse embalm full many an act
      Worthless as they who wrought it: 'tis the doom
      Of spirits of my order to be racked
    In life, to wear their hearts out, and consume
      Their days in endless strife, and die alone;
      Then future thousands crowd around their tomb,
    And pilgrims come from climes where they have known
      The name of him--who now is but a name,
      And wasting homage o'er the sullen stone,
    Spread his--by him unheard, unheeded--fame;
      And mine at least hath cost me dear: to die
      Is nothing; but to wither thus--to tame
    My mind down from its own infinity--
      To live in narrow ways with little men,
      A common sight to every common eye,
    A wanderer, while even wolves can find a den,
      Ripped from all kindred, from all home, all things
      That make communion sweet, and soften pain--
    To feel me in the solitude of kings
      Without the power that makes them bear a crown--
      To envy every dove his nest and wings
    Which waft him where the Apennine looks down
      On Arno, till he perches, it may be,
      Within my all inexorable town,
    Where yet my boys are, and that fatal She,
      Their mother, the cold partner who hath brought
      Destruction for a dowry--this to see
    And feel, and know without repair, hath taught
      A bitter lesson; but it leaves me free:
      I have not vilely found, nor basely sought,
    They made an Exile--not a Slave of me.

                            CANTO THE SECOND.

    The Spirit of the fervent days of Old,
      When words were things that came to pass, and Thought
      Flashed o'er the future, bidding men behold
    Their children's children's doom already brought
      Forth from the abyss of Time which is to be,
      The Chaos of events, where lie half-wrought
    Shapes that must undergo mortality;
      What the great Seers of Israel wore within,
      That Spirit was on them, and is on me,
    And if, Cassandra-like, amidst the din
      Of conflict none will hear, or hearing heed
      This voice from out the Wilderness, the sin
    Be theirs, and my own feelings be my meed,
      The only guerdon I have ever known.
      Hast thou not bled? and hast thou still to bleed,
    Italia? Ah! to me such things, foreshown
      With dim sepulchral light, bid me forget
      In thine irreparable wrongs my own;
    We can have but one Country, and even yet
      Thou'rt mine--my bones shall be within thy breast,
      My Soul within thy language, which once set
    With our old Roman sway in the wide West;
      But I will make another tongue arise
      As lofty and more sweet, in which expressed
    The hero's ardour, or the lover's sighs,
      Shall find alike such sounds for every theme
      That every word, as brilliant as thy skies,
    Shall realise a Poet's proudest dream,
      And make thee Europe's Nightingale of Song;
      So that all present speech to thine shall seem
    The note of meaner birds, and every tongue
      Confess its barbarism when compared with thine.
      This shalt thou owe to him thou didst so wrong,
    Thy Tuscan bard, the banished Ghibelline.
      Woe! woe! the veil of coming centuries
      Is rent,--a thousand years which yet supine
    Lie like the ocean waves ere winds arise,
      Heaving in dark and sullen undulation,
      Float from Eternity into these eyes;
    The storms yet sleep, the clouds still keep their station,
      The unborn Earthquake yet is in the womb,
      The bloody Chaos yet expects Creation,
    But all things are disposing for thy doom;
      The Elements await but for the Word,
      "Let there be darkness!" and thou grow'st a tomb!
    Yes! thou, so beautiful, shalt feel the sword,
      Thou, Italy! so fair that Paradise,
      Revived in thee, blooms forth to man restored:
    Ah! must the sons of Adam lose it twice?
      Thou, Italy! whose ever golden fields,
      Ploughed by the sunbeams solely, would suffice
    For the world's granary; thou, whose sky Heaven gilds
      With brighter stars, and robes with deeper blue;
      Thou, in whose pleasant places Summer builds
    Her palace, in whose cradle Empire grew,
      And formed the Eternal City's ornaments
      From spoils of Kings whom freemen overthrew;
    Birthplace of heroes, sanctuary of Saints,
      Where earthly first, then heavenly glory made
      Her home; thou, all which fondest Fancy paints,
    And finds her prior vision but portrayed
      In feeble colours, when the eye--from the Alp
      Of horrid snow, and rock, and shaggy shade
    Of desert-loving pine, whose emerald scalp
      Nods to the storm--dilates and dotes o'er thee,
      And wistfully implores, as 'twere, for help
    To see thy sunny fields, my Italy,
      Nearer and nearer yet, and dearer still
      The more approached, and dearest were they free,
    Thou--Thou must wither to each tyrant's will:
      The Goth hath been,--the German, Frank, and Hun
      Are yet to come,--and on the imperial hill
    Ruin, already proud of the deeds done
      By the old barbarians, there awaits the new,
      Throned on the Palatine, while lost and won
    Rome at her feet lies bleeding; and the hue
      Of human sacrifice and Roman slaughter
      Troubles the clotted air, of late so blue,
    And deepens into red the saffron water
      Of Tiber, thick with dead; the helpless priest,
      And still more helpless nor less holy daughter,
    Vowed to their God, have shrieking fled, and ceased
      Their ministry: the nations take their prey,
      Iberian, Almain, Lombard, and the beast
    And bird, wolf, vulture, more humane than they
      Are; these but gorge the flesh, and lap the gore
      Of the departed, and then go their way;
    But those, the human savages, explore
      All paths of torture, and insatiate yet,
      With Ugolino hunger prowl for more.
    Nine moons shall rise o'er scenes like this and set;
      The chiefless army of the dead, which late
      Beneath the traitor Prince's banner met,
    Hath left its leader's ashes at the gate;
      Had but the royal Rebel lived, perchance
      Thou hadst been spared, but his involved thy fate.
    Oh! Rome, the Spoiler or the spoil of France,
      From Brennus to the Bourbon, never, never
      Shall foreign standard to thy walls advance,
    But Tiber shall become a mournful river.
      Oh! when the strangers pass the Alps and Po,
      Crush them, ye Rocks! Floods whelm them, and for ever!
    Why sleep the idle Avalanches so,
      To topple on the lonely pilgrim's head?
      Why doth Eridanus but overflow
    The peasant's harvest from his turbid bed?
      Were not each barbarous horde a nobler prey?
      Over Cambyses' host the desert spread
    Her sandy ocean, and the Sea-waves' sway
      Rolled over Pharaoh and his thousands,--why,
      Mountains and waters, do ye not as they?
    And you, ye Men! Romans, who dare not die,
      Sons of the conquerors who overthrew
      Those who overthrew proud Xerxes, where yet lie
    The dead whose tomb Oblivion never knew,
      Are the Alps weaker than Thermopylae?
      Their passes more alluring to the view
    Of an invader? is it they, or ye,
      That to each host the mountain-gate unbar,
      And leave the march in peace, the passage free?
    Why, Nature's self detains the Victor's car,
      And makes your land impregnable, if earth
      Could be so; but alone she will not war,
    Yet aids the warrior worthy of his birth
      In a soil where the mothers bring forth men:
      Not so with those whose souls are little worth;
    For them no fortress can avail,--the den
      Of the poor reptile which preserves its sting
      Is more secure than walls of adamant, when
    The hearts of those within are quivering.
      Are ye not brave? Yes, yet the Ausonian soil
      Hath hearts, and hands, and arms, and hosts to bring
    Against Oppression; but how vain the toil,
      While still Division sows the seeds of woe
      And weakness, till the Stranger reaps the spoil.
    Oh! my own beauteous land! so long laid low,
      So long the grave of thy own children's hopes,
      When there is but required a single blow
    To break the chain, yet--yet the Avenger stops,
      And Doubt and Discord step 'twixt thine and thee,
      And join their strength to that which with thee copes;
    What is there wanting then to set thee free,
      And show thy beauty in its fullest light?
      To make the Alps impassable; and we,
    Her Sons, may do this with one deed--Unite.

                            CANTO THE THIRD.

    From out the mass of never-dying ill,
      The Plague, the Prince, the Stranger, and the Sword,
      Vials of wrath but emptied to refill
    And flow again, I cannot all record
      That crowds on my prophetic eye: the Earth
      And Ocean written o'er would not afford
    Space for the annal, yet it shall go forth;
      Yes, all, though not by human pen, is graven,
      There where the farthest suns and stars have birth,
    Spread like a banner at the gate of Heaven,
      The bloody scroll of our millennial wrongs
      Waves, and the echo of our groans is driven
    Athwart the sound of archangelic songs,
      And Italy, the martyred nation's gore,
      Will not in vain arise to where belongs
    Omnipotence and Mercy evermore:
      Like to a harpstring stricken by the wind,
      The sound of her lament shall, rising o'er
    The Seraph voices, touch the Almighty Mind.
      Meantime I, humblest of thy sons, and of
      Earth's dust by immortality refined
    To Sense and Suffering, though the vain may scoff,
      And tyrants threat, and meeker victims bow
      Before the storm because its breath is rough,
    To thee, my Country! whom before, as now,
      I loved and love, devote the mournful lyre
      And melancholy gift high Powers allow
    To read the future: and if now my fire
      Is not as once it shone o'er thee, forgive!
      I but foretell thy fortunes--then expire;
    Think not that I would look on them and live.
      A Spirit forces me to see and speak,
      And for my guerdon grants not to survive;
    My Heart shall be poured over thee and break:
      Yet for a moment, ere I must resume
      Thy sable web of Sorrow, let me take
    Over the gleams that flash athwart thy gloom
      A softer glimpse; some stars shine through thy night,
      And many meteors, and above thy tomb
    Leans sculptured Beauty, which Death cannot blight:
      And from thine ashes boundless Spirits rise
      To give thee honour, and the earth delight;
    Thy soil shall still be pregnant with the wise,
      The gay, the learned, the generous, and the brave,
      Native to thee as Summer to thy skies,
    Conquerors on foreign shores, and the far wave,
      Discoverers of new worlds, which take their name;
      For thee alone they have no arm to save,
    And all thy recompense is in their fame,
      A noble one to them, but not to thee--
      Shall they be glorious, and thou still the same?
    Oh! more than these illustrious far shall be
      The Being--and even yet he may be born--
      The mortal Saviour who shall set thee free,
    And see thy diadem, so changed and worn
      By fresh barbarians, on thy brow replaced;
      And the sweet Sun replenishing thy morn,
    Thy moral morn, too long with clouds defaced,
      And noxious vapours from Avernus risen,
      Such as all they must breathe who are debased
    By Servitude, and have the mind in prison.
      Yet through this centuried eclipse of woe
      Some voices shall be heard, and Earth shall listen;
    Poets shall follow in the path I show,
      And make it broader: the same brilliant sky
      Which cheers the birds to song shall bid them glow,
    And raise their notes as natural and high;
      Tuneful shall be their numbers; they shall sing
      Many of Love, and some of Liberty,
    But few shall soar upon that Eagle's wing,
      And look in the Sun's face, with Eagle's gaze,
      All free and fearless as the feathered King,
    But fly more near the earth; how many a phrase
      Sublime shall lavished be on some small prince
      In all the prodigality of Praise!
    And language, eloquently false, evince
      The harlotry of Genius, which, like Beauty,
      Too oft forgets its own self-reverence,
    And looks on prostitution as a duty.
      He who once enters in a Tyrant's hall
      As guest is slave--his thoughts become a booty,
    And the first day which sees the chain enthral
      A captive, sees his half of Manhood gone--
      The Soul's emasculation saddens all
    His spirit; thus the Bard too near the throne
      Quails from his inspiration, bound to please,--
      How servile is the task to please alone!
    To smooth the verse to suit his Sovereign's ease
      And royal leisure, nor too much prolong
      Aught save his eulogy, and find, and seize,
    Or force, or forge fit argument of Song!
      Thus trammelled, thus condemned to Flattery's trebles,
      He toils through all, still trembling to be wrong:
    For fear some noble thoughts, like heavenly rebels,
      Should rise up in high treason to his brain,
      He sings, as the Athenian spoke, with pebbles
    In's mouth, lest Truth should stammer through his strain.
      But out of the long file of sonneteers
      There shall be some who will not sing in vain,
    And he, their Prince, shall rank among my peers,
      And Love shall be his torment; but his grief
      Shall make an immortality of tears,
    And Italy shall hail him as the Chief
      Of Poet-lovers, and his higher song
      Of Freedom wreathe him with as green a leaf.
    But in a farther age shall rise along
      The banks of Po two greater still than he;
      The World which smiled on him shall do them wrong
    Till they are ashes, and repose with me.
      The first will make an epoch with his lyre,
      And fill the earth with feats of Chivalry:
    His Fancy like a rainbow, and his Fire,
      Like that of Heaven, immortal, and his Thought
      Borne onward with a wing that cannot tire;
    Pleasure shall, like a butterfly new caught,
      Flutter her lovely pinions o'er his theme,
      And Art itself seem into Nature wrought
    By the transparency of his bright dream.--
      The second, of a tenderer, sadder mood,
      Shall pour his soul out o'er Jerusalem;
    He, too, shall sing of Arms, and Christian blood
      Shed where Christ bled for man; and his high harp
      Shall, by the willow over Jordan's flood,
    Revive a song of Sion, and the sharp
      Conflict, and final triumph of the brave
      And pious, and the strife of Hell to warp
    Their hearts from their great purpose, until wave
      The red-cross banners where the first red Cross
      Was crimsoned from His veins who died to save,
    Shall be his sacred argument; the loss
      Of years, of favour, freedom, even of fame
      Contested for a time, while the smooth gloss
    Of Courts would slide o'er his forgotten name
      And call Captivity a kindness--meant
      To shield him from insanity or shame--
    Such shall be his meek guerdon! who was sent
      To be Christ's Laureate--they reward him well!
      Florence dooms me but death or banishment,
    Ferrara him a pittance and a cell,
      Harder to bear and less deserved, for I
      Had stung the factions which I strove to quell;
    But this meek man who with a lover's eye
      Will look on Earth and Heaven, and who will deign
      To embalm with his celestial flattery,
    As poor a thing as e'er was spawned to reign,
      What will he do to merit such a doom?
      Perhaps he'll love,--and is not Love in vain
    Torture enough without a living tomb?
      Yet it will be so--he and his compeer,
      The Bard of Chivalry, will both consume
    In penury and pain too many a year,
      And, dying in despondency, bequeath
      To the kind World, which scarce will yield a tear,
    A heritage enriching all who breathe
      With the wealth of a genuine Poet's soul,
      And to their country a redoubled wreath,
    Unmatched by time; not Hellas can unroll
      Through her Olympiads two such names, though one
      Of hers be mighty;--and is this the whole
    Of such men's destiny beneath the Sun?
      Must all the finer thoughts, the thrilling sense,
      The electric blood with which their arteries run,
    Their body's self turned soul with the intense
      Feeling of that which is, and fancy of
      That which should be, to such a recompense
    Conduct? shall their bright plumage on the rough
      Storm be still scattered? Yes, and it must be;
      For, formed of far too penetrable stuff,
    These birds of Paradise but long to flee
      Back to their native mansion, soon they find
      Earth's mist with their pure pinions not agree,
    And die or are degraded; for the mind
      Succumbs to long infection, and despair,
      And vulture Passions flying close behind,
    Await the moment to assail and tear;
      And when, at length, the winged wanderers stoop,
      Then is the Prey-birds' triumph, then they share
    The spoil, o'erpowered at length by one fell swoop.
      Yet some have been untouched who learned to bear,
      Some whom no Power could ever force to droop,
    Who could resist themselves even, hardest care!
      And task most hopeless; but some such have been,
      And if my name amongst the number were,
    That Destiny austere, and yet serene,
      Were prouder than more dazzling fame unblessed;
      The Alp's snow summit nearer heaven is seen
    Than the Volcano's fierce eruptive crest,
      Whose splendour from the black abyss is flung,
      While the scorched mountain, from whose burning breast
    A temporary torturing flame is wrung,
      Shines for a night of terror, then repels
      Its fire back to the Hell from whence it sprung,
    The Hell which in its entrails ever dwells.

                           CANTO THE FOURTH.

    Many are Poets who have never penned
      Their inspiration, and perchance the best:
      They felt, and loved, and died, but would not lend
    Their thoughts to meaner beings; they compressed
      The God within them, and rejoined the stars
      Unlaurelled upon earth, but far more blessed
    Than those who are degraded by the jars
      Of Passion, and their frailties linked to fame,
      Conquerors of high renown, but full of scars.
    Many are Poets but without the name;
      For what is Poesy but to create
      From overfeeling Good or Ill; and aim
    At an external life beyond our fate,
      And be the new Prometheus of new men,
      Bestowing fire from Heaven, and then, too late,
    Finding the pleasure given repaid with pain,
      And vultures to the heart of the bestower,
      Who, having lavished his high gift in vain,
    Lies to his lone rock by the sea-shore?
      So be it: we can bear.--But thus all they
      Whose Intellect is an o'ermastering Power
    Which still recoils from its encumbering clay
      Or lightens it to spirit, whatsoe'er
      The form which their creations may essay,
    Are bards; the kindled Marble's bust may wear
      More poesy upon its speaking brow
      Than aught less than the Homeric page may bear;
    One noble stroke with a whole life may glow,
      Or deify the canvass till it shine
      With beauty so surpassing all below,
    That they who kneel to Idols so divine
      Break no commandment, for high Heaven is there
      Transfused, transfigurated: and the line
    Of Poesy, which peoples but the air
      With Thought and Beings of our thought reflected,
      Can do no more: then let the artist share
    The palm, he shares the peril, and dejected
      Faints o'er the labour unapproved--Alas!
      Despair and Genius are too oft connected.
    Within the ages which before me pass
      Art shall resume and equal even the sway
      Which with Apelles and old Phidias
    She held in Hellas' unforgotten day.
      Ye shall be taught by Ruin to revive
      The Grecian forms at least from their decay,
    And Roman souls at last again shall live
      In Roman works wrought by Italian hands,
      And temples, loftier than the old temples, give
    New wonders to the World; and while still stands
      The austere Pantheon, into heaven shall soar
      A Dome, its image, while the base expands
    Into a fane surpassing all before,
      Such as all flesh shall flock to kneel in: ne'er
      Such sight hath been unfolded by a door
    As this, to which all nations shall repair,
      And lay their sins at this huge gate of Heaven.
      And the bold Architect unto whose care
    The daring charge to raise it shall be given,
      Whom all Arts shall acknowledge as their Lord,
      Whether into the marble chaos driven
    His chisel bid the Hebrew, at whose word
      Israel left Egypt, stop the waves in stone,
      Or hues of Hell be by his pencil poured
    Over the damned before the Judgement-throne,
      Such as I saw them, such as all shall see,
      Or fanes be built of grandeur yet unknown--
    The Stream of his great thoughts shall spring from me
      The Ghibelline, who traversed the three realms
      Which form the Empire of Eternity.
    Amidst the clash of swords, and clang of helms,
      The age which I anticipate, no less
      Shall be the Age of Beauty, and while whelms
    Calamity the nations with distress,
      The Genius of my Country shall arise,
      A Cedar towering o'er the Wilderness,
    Lovely in all its branches to all eyes,
      Fragrant as fair, and recognised afar,
      Wafting its native incense through the skies.
    Sovereigns shall pause amidst their sport of war,
      Weaned for an hour from blood, to turn and gaze
      On canvass or on stone; and they who mar
    All beauty upon earth, compelled to praise,
      Shall feel the power of that which they destroy;
      And Art's mistaken gratitude shall raise
    To tyrants, who but take her for a toy,
      Emblems and monuments, and prostitute
      Her charms to Pontiffs proud, who but employ
    The man of Genius as the meanest brute
      To bear a burthen, and to serve a need,
      To sell his labours, and his soul to boot.
    Who toils for nations may be poor indeed,
      But free; who sweats for Monarchs is no more
      Than the gilt Chamberlain, who, clothed and feed,
    Stands sleek and slavish, bowing at his door.
      Oh, Power that rulest and inspirest! how
      Is it that they on earth, whose earthly power
    Is likest thine in heaven in outward show,
      Least like to thee in attributes divine,
      Tread on the universal necks that bow,
    And then assure us that their rights are thine?
      And how is it that they, the Sons of Fame,
      Whose inspiration seems to them to shine
    From high, they whom the nations oftest name,
      Must pass their days in penury or pain,
      Or step to grandeur through the paths of shame,
    And wear a deeper brand and gaudier chain?
      Or if their Destiny be born aloof
      From lowliness, or tempted thence in vain,
    In their own souls sustain a harder proof,
      The inner war of Passions deep and fierce?
      Florence! when thy harsh sentence razed my roof,
    I loved thee; but the vengeance of my verse,
      The hate of injuries which every year
      Makes greater, and accumulates my curse,
    Shall live, outliving all thou holdest dear--
      Thy pride, thy wealth, thy freedom, and even that,
      The most infernal of all evils here,
    The sway of petty tyrants in a state;
      For such sway is not limited to Kings,
      And Demagogues yield to them but in date,
    As swept off sooner; in all deadly things,
      Which make men hate themselves, and one another,
      In discord, cowardice, cruelty, all that springs
    From Death the Sin-born's incest with his mother,
      In rank oppression in its rudest shape,
      The faction Chief is but the Sultan's brother,
    And the worst Despot's far less human ape.
      Florence! when this lone spirit, which so long
      Yearned, as the captive toiling at escape,
    To fly back to thee in despite of wrong,
      An exile, saddest of all prisoners,
      Who has the whole world for a dungeon strong,
    Seas, mountains, and the horizon's verge for bars,
      Which shut him from the sole small spot of earth
      Where--whatsoe'er his fate--he still were hers,
    His Country's, and might die where he had birth--
      Florence! when this lone Spirit shall return
      To kindred Spirits, thou wilt feel my worth,
    And seek to honour with an empty urn
      The ashes thou shalt ne'er obtain--Alas!
      "What have I done to thee, my People?" Stern
    Are all thy dealings, but in this they pass
      The limits of Man's common malice, for
      All that a citizen could be I was--
    Raised by thy will, all thine in peace or war--
      And for this thou hast warred with me.--'Tis done:
      I may not overleap the eternal bar
    Built up between us, and will die alone,
      Beholding with the dark eye of a Seer
      The evil days to gifted souls foreshown,
    Foretelling them to those who will not hear;
      As in the old time, till the hour be come
      When Truth shall strike their eyes through many a tear,
    And make them own the Prophet in his tomb.
                                                           
                          THE MORGANTE MAGGIORE

                                 OF PULCI.

                             CANTO THE FIRST.

                        I.

    In the beginning was the Word next God;
      God was the Word, the Word no less was He:
    This was in the beginning, to my mode
      Of thinking, and without Him nought could be:
    Therefore, just Lord! from out thy high abode,
      Benign and pious, bid an angel flee,
    One only, to be my companion, who
    Shall help my famous, worthy, old song through.

                        II.

    And thou, oh Virgin! daughter, mother, bride,
      Of the same Lord, who gave to you each key
    Of Heaven, and Hell, and every thing beside,
      The day thy Gabriel said "All hail!" to thee,
    Since to thy servants Pity's ne'er denied,
      With flowing rhymes, a pleasant style and free,
    Be to my verses then benignly kind,
    And to the end illuminate my mind.

                        III.

    'Twas in the season when sad Philomel
      Weeps with her sister, who remembers and
    Deplores the ancient woes which both befel,
      And makes the nymphs enamoured, to the hand
    Of Phaeton, by Phoebus loved so well,
      His car (but tempered by his sire's command)
    Was given, and on the horizon's verge just now
    Appeared, so that Tithonus scratched his brow:

                        IV.

    When I prepared my bark first to obey,
      As it should still obey, the helm, my mind,
    And carry prose or rhyme, and this my lay
      Of Charles the Emperor, whom you will find
    By several pens already praised; but they
      Who to diffuse his glory were inclined,
    For all that I can see in prose or verse,
    Have understood Charles badly, and wrote worse.

                        V.

    Leonardo Aretino said already,
      That if, like Pepin, Charles had had a writer
    Of genius quick, and diligently steady,
      No hero would in history look brighter;
    He in the cabinet being always ready,
      And in the field a most victorious fighter,
    Who for the church and Christian faith had wrought,
    Certes, far more than yet is said or thought.

                        VI.

    You still may see at Saint Liberatore,
      The abbey, no great way from Manopell,
    Erected in the Abruzzi to his glory,
      Because of the great battle in which fell
    A pagan king, according to the story,
      And felon people whom Charles sent to Hell:
    And there are bones so many, and so many,
    Near them Giusaffa's would seem few, if any.

                        VII.

    But the world, blind and ignorant, don't prize
      His virtues as I wish to see them: thou,
    Florence, by his great bounty don't arise,
      And hast, and may have, if thou wilt allow,
    All proper customs and true courtesies:
      Whate'er thou hast acquired from then till now,
    With knightly courage, treasure, or the lance,
    Is sprung from out the noble blood of France.

                        VIII.

    Twelve Paladins had Charles in court, of whom
      The wisest and most famous was Orlando;
    Him traitor Gan conducted to the tomb
      In Roncesvalles, as the villain planned too,
    While the horn rang so loud, and knelled the doom
      Of their sad rout, though he did all knight can do:
    And Dante in his comedy has given
    To him a happy seat with Charles in Heaven.

                        IX.

    'Twas Christmas-day; in Paris all his court
      Charles held; the Chief, I say, Orlando was,
    The Dane; Astolfo there too did resort,
      Also Ansuigi, the gay time to pass
    In festival and in triumphal sport,
      The much-renowned St. Dennis being the cause;
    Angiolin of Bayonne, and Oliver,
    And gentle Belinghieri too came there:

                        X.

    Avolio, and Arino, and Othone
      Of Normandy, and Richard Paladin,
    Wise Hamo, and the ancient Salamone,
      Walter of Lion's Mount, and Baldovin,
    Who was the son of the sad Ganellone,
      Were there, exciting too much gladness in
    The son of Pepin:--when his knights came hither,
    He groaned with joy to see them altogether.

                        XI.

    But watchful Fortune, lurking, takes good heed
      Ever some bar 'gainst our intents to bring.
    While Charles reposed him thus, in word and deed,
      Orlando ruled court, Charles, and every thing;
    Curst Gan, with envy bursting, had such need
      To vent his spite, that thus with Charles the king
    One day he openly began to say,
    "Orlando must we always then obey?

                        XII.

    "A thousand times I've been about to say,
      Orlando too presumptuously goes on;
    Here are we, counts, kings, dukes, to own thy sway,
      Hamo, and Otho, Ogier, Solomon,
    Each have to honour thee and to obey;
      But he has too much credit near the throne,
    Which we won't suffer, but are quite decided
    By such a boy to be no longer guided.

                        XIII.

    "And even at Aspramont thou didst begin
      To let him know he was a gallant knight,
    And by the fount did much the day to win;
      But I know who that day had won the fight
    If it had not for good Gherardo been;
      The victory was Almonte's else; his sight
    He kept upon the standard--and the laurels,
    In fact and fairness, are his earning, Charles!

                        XIV.

    "If thou rememberest being in Gascony,
      When there advanced the nations out of Spain
    The Christian cause had suffered shamefully,
      Had not his valour driven them back again.
    Best speak the truth when there's a reason why:
      Know then, oh Emperor! that all complain:
    As for myself, I shall repass the mounts
    O'er which I crossed with two and sixty counts.

                        XV.

    "'Tis fit thy grandeur should dispense relief,
      So that each here may have his proper part,
    For the whole court is more or less in grief:
      Perhaps thou deem'st this lad a Mars in heart?"
    Orlando one day heard this speech in brief,
      As by himself it chanced he sate apart:
    Displeased he was with Gan because he said it,
    But much more still that Charles should give him credit.

                        XVI.

    And with the sword he would have murdered Gan,
      But Oliver thrust in between the pair,
    And from his hand extracted Durlindan,
      And thus at length they separated were.
    Orlando angry too with Carloman,
      Wanted but little to have slain him there;
    Then forth alone from Paris went the Chief,
    And burst and maddened with disdain and grief.

                        XVII.

    From Ermellina, consort of the Dane,
      He took Cortana, and then took Rondell,
    And on towards Brara pricked him o'er the plain;
      And when she saw him coming, Aldabelle
    Stretched forth her arms to clasp her lord again:
      Orlando, in whose brain all was not well,
    As "Welcome, my Orlando, home," she said,
    Raised up his sword to smite her on the head.

                        XVIII.

    Like him a Fury counsels, his revenge
      On Gan in that rash act he seemed to take,
    Which Aldabella thought extremely strange;
      But soon Orlando found himself awake;
    And his spouse took his bridle on this change,
      And he dismounted from his horse, and spake
    Of every thing which passed without demur,
    And then reposed himself some days with her.

                        XIX.

    Then full of wrath departed from the place,
      As far as pagan countries roamed astray,
    And while he rode, yet still at every pace
      The traitor Gan remembered by the way;
    And wandering on in error a long space,
      An abbey which in a lone desert lay,
    'Midst glens obscure, and distant lands, he found,
    Which formed the Christian's and the Pagan's bound.

                        XX.

    The Abbot was called Clermont, and by blood
      Descended from Angrante: under cover
    Of a great mountain's brow the abbey stood,
      But certain savage giants looked him over;
    One Passamont was foremost of the brood,
      And Alabaster and Morgante hover
    Second and third, with certain slings, and throw
    In daily jeopardy the place below.

                        XXI.

    The monks could pass the convent gate no more,
      Nor leave their cells for water or for wood;
    Orlando knocked, but none would ope, before
      Unto the Prior it at length seemed good;
    Entered, he said that he was taught to adore
      Him who was born of Mary's holiest blood,
    And was baptized a Christian; and then showed
    How to the abbey he had found his road.

                        XXII.

    Said the Abbot, "You are welcome; what is mine
      We give you freely, since that you believe
    With us in Mary Mother's Son divine;
      And that you may not, Cavalier, conceive
    The cause of our delay to let you in
      To be rusticity, you shall receive
    The reason why our gate was barred to you:
    Thus those who in suspicion live must do.

                        XXIII.

    "When hither to inhabit first we came
      These mountains, albeit that they are obscure,
    As you perceive, yet without fear or blame
      They seemed to promise an asylum sure:
    From savage brutes alone, too fierce to tame,
      'Twas fit our quiet dwelling to secure;
    But now, if here we'd stay, we needs must guard
    Against domestic beasts with watch and ward.

                        XXIV.

    "These make us stand, in fact, upon the watch;
      For late there have appeared three giants rough,
    What nation or what kingdom bore the batch
      I know not, but they are all of savage stuff;
    When Force and Malice with some genius match,
      You know, they can do all--we are not enough:
    And these so much our orisons derange,
    I know not what to do, till matters change.

                        XXV.

    "Our ancient fathers, living the desert in,
      For just and holy works were duly fed;
    Think not they lived on locusts sole, 'tis certain
      That manna was rained down from heaven instead;
    But here 'tis fit we keep on the alert in
      Our bounds, or taste the stones showered down for bread,
    From off yon mountain daily raining faster,
    And flung by Passamont and Alabaster.

                        XXVI.

    "The third, Morgante, 's savagest by far; he
      Plucks up pines, beeches, poplar-trees, and oaks,
    And flings them, our community to bury;
      And all that I can do but more provokes."
    While thus they parley in the cemetery,
      A stone from one of their gigantic strokes,
    Which nearly crushed Rondell, came tumbling over,
    So that he took a long leap under cover.

                        XXVII.

    "For God-sake, Cavalier, come in with speed;
      The manna's falling now," the Abbot cried.
    "This fellow does not wish my horse should feed,
      Dear Abbot," Roland unto him replied,
    "Of restiveness he'd cure him had he need;
      That stone seems with good will and aim applied."
    The holy father said, "I don't deceive;
    They'll one day fling the mountain, I believe."

                        XXVIII.

    Orlando bade them take care of Rondello,
      And also made a breakfast of his own;
    "Abbot," he said, "I want to find that fellow
      Who flung at my good horse yon corner-stone."
    Said the abbot, "Let not my advice seem shallow;
      As to a brother dear I speak alone;
    I would dissuade you, Baron, from this strife,
    As knowing sure that you will lose your life.

                        XXIX.

    "That Passamont has in his hand three darts--
      Such slings, clubs, ballast-stones, that yield you must:
    You know that giants have much stouter hearts
      Than us, with reason, in proportion just:
    If go you will, guard well against their arts,
      For these are very barbarous and robust."
    Orlando answered," This I'll see, be sure,
    And walk the wild on foot to be secure."

                        XXX.

    The Abbot signed the great cross on his front,
      "Then go you with God's benison and mine."
    Orlando, after he had scaled the mount,
      As the Abbot had directed, kept the line
    Right to the usual haunt of Passamont;
      Who, seeing him alone in this design,
    Surveyed him fore and aft with eyes observant,
    Then asked him, "If he wished to stay as servant?"

                        XXXI.

    And promised him an office of great ease.
      But, said Orlando, "Saracen insane!
    I come to kill you, if it shall so please
      God, not to serve as footboy in your train;
    You with his monks so oft have broke the peace--
      Vile dog! 'tis past his patience to sustain."
    The Giant ran to fetch his arms, quite furious,
    When he received an answer so injurious.

                        XXXII.

    And being returned to where Orlando stood,
      Who had not moved him from the spot, and swinging
    The cord, he hurled a stone with strength so rude,
      As showed a sample of his skill in slinging;
    It rolled on Count Orlando's helmet good
      And head, and set both head and helmet ringing,
    So that he swooned with pain as if he died,
    But more than dead, he seemed so stupified.

                        XXXIII.

    Then Passamont, who thought him slain outright,
      Said, "I will go, and while he lies along,
    Disarm me: why such craven did I fight?"
      But Christ his servants ne'er abandons long,
    Especially Orlando, such a knight,
      As to desert would almost be a wrong.
    While the giant goes to put off his defences,
    Orlando has recalled his force and senses:

                        XXXIV.

    And loud he shouted, "Giant, where dost go?
      Thou thought'st me doubtless for the bier outlaid;
    To the right about--without wings thou'rt too slow
      To fly my vengeance--currish renegade!
    'Twas but by treachery thou laid'st me low."
      The giant his astonishment betrayed,
    And turned about, and stopped his journey on,
    And then he stooped to pick up a great stone.

                        XXXV.

    Orlando had Cortana bare in hand;
      To split the head in twain was what he schemed:
    Cortana clave the skull like a true brand,
      And pagan Passamont died unredeemed;
    Yet harsh and haughty, as he lay he banned,
      And most devoutly Macon still blasphemed;
    But while his crude, rude blasphemies he heard,
    Orlando thanked the Father and the Word,--

                        XXXVI.

    Saying, "What grace to me thou'st this day given!
      And I to thee, O Lord! am ever bound;
    I know my life was saved by thee from Heaven,
      Since by the Giant I was fairly downed.
    All things by thee are measured just and even;
      Our power without thine aid would nought be found:
    I pray thee take heed of me, till I can
    At least return once more to Carloman."

                        XXXVII.

    And having said thus much, he went his way;
      And Alabaster he found out below,
    Doing the very best that in him lay
      To root from out a bank a rock or two.
    Orlando, when he reached him, loud 'gan say,
      "How think'st thou, glutton, such a stone to throw?"
    When Alabaster heard his deep voice ring,
    He suddenly betook him to his sling,

                        XXXVIII.

    And hurled a fragment of a size so large
      That if it had in fact fulfilled its mission,
    And Roland not availed him of his targe,
      There would have been no need of a physician.
    Orlando set himself in turn to charge,
      And in his bulky bosom made incision
    With all his sword. The lout fell; but o'erthrown, he
    However by no means forgot Macone.

                        XXXIX.

    Morgante had a palace in his mode,
      Composed of branches, logs of wood, and earth,
    And stretched himself at ease in this abode,
      And shut himself at night within his berth.
    Orlando knocked, and knocked again, to goad
      The giant from his sleep; and he came forth,
    The door to open, like a crazy thing,
    For a rough dream had shook him slumbering.

                        XL.

    He thought that a fierce serpent had attacked him,
      And Mahomet he called; but Mahomet
    Is nothing worth, and, not an instant backed him;
      But praying blessed Jesu, he was set
    At liberty from all the fears which racked him;
      And to the gate he came with great regret--
    "Who knocks here?" grumbling all the while, said he.
    "That," said Orlando, "you will quickly see:

                        XLI.

    "I come to preach to you, as to your brothers,--
      Sent by the miserable monks--repentance;
    For Providence divine, in you and others,
      Condemns the evil done, my new acquaintance!
    'Tis writ on high--your wrong must pay another's:
      From Heaven itself is issued out this sentence.
    Know then, that colder now than a pilaster
    I left your Passamont and Alabaster."

                        XLII.

    Morgante said, "Oh gentle Cavalier!
      Now by thy God say me no villany;
    The favour of your name I fain would hear,
      And if a Christian, speak for courtesy."
    Replied Orlando, "So much to your ear
      I by my faith disclose contentedly;
    Christ I adore, who is the genuine Lord,
    And, if you please, by you may be adored."

                        XLIII.

    The Saracen rejoined in humble tone,
      "I have had an extraordinary vision;
    A savage serpent fell on me alone,
      And Macon would not pity my condition;
    Hence to thy God, who for ye did atone
      Upon the cross, preferred I my petition;
    His timely succour set me safe and free,
    And I a Christian am disposed to be."

                        XLIV.

    Orlando answered, "Baron just and pious,
      If this good wish your heart can really move
    To the true God, who will not then deny us
      Eternal honour, you will go above,
    And, if you please, as friends we will ally us,
      And I will love you with a perfect love.
    Your idols are vain liars, full of fraud:
    The only true God is the Christian's God.

                        XLV.

    "The Lord descended to the virgin breast
      Of Mary Mother, sinless and divine;
    If you acknowledge the Redeemer blest,
      Without whom neither sun nor star can shine,
    Abjure bad Macon's false and felon test,
      Your renegado god, and worship mine,
    Baptize yourself with zeal, since you repent."
    To which Morgante answered, "I'm content."

                        XLVI.

    And then Orlando to embrace him flew,
      And made much of his convert, as he cried,
    "To the abbey I will gladly marshal you."
      To whom Morgante, "Let us go," replied:
    "I to the friars have for peace to sue."
      Which thing Orlando heard with inward pride,
    Saying, "My brother, so devout and good,
    Ask the Abbot pardon, as I wish you would:

                        XLVII.

    "Since God has granted your illumination,
      Accepting you in mercy for his own,
    Humility should be your first oblation."
      Morgante said, "For goodness' sake, make known,--
    Since that your God is to be mine--your station,
      And let your name in verity be shown;
    Then will I everything at your command do."
    On which the other said, he was Orlando.

                        XLVIII.

    "Then," quoth the Giant, "blessed be Jesu
      A thousand times with gratitude and praise!
    Oft, perfect Baron! have I heard of you
      Through all the different periods of my days:
    And, as I said, to be your vassal too
      I wish, for your great gallantry always."
    Thus reasoning, they continued much to say,
    And onwards to the abbey went their way.

                        XLIX.

    And by the way about the giants dead
      Orlando with Morgante reasoned: "Be,
    For their decease, I pray you, comforted,
      And, since it is God's pleasure, pardon me;
    A thousand wrongs unto the monks they bred;
      And our true Scripture soundeth openly,
    Good is rewarded, and chastised the ill,
    Which the Lord never faileth to fulfil:

                        L.

    "Because His love of justice unto all
      Is such, He wills His judgment should devour
    All who have sin, however great or small;
      But good He well remembers to restore.
    Nor without justice holy could we call
      Him, whom I now require you to adore.
    All men must make His will their wishes sway,
    And quickly and spontaneously obey.

                        LI.

    "And here our doctors are of one accord,
      Coming on this point to the same conclusion,--
    That in their thoughts, who praise in Heaven the Lord,
      If Pity e'er was guilty of intrusion
    For their unfortunate relations stored
      In Hell below, and damned in great confusion,
    Their happiness would be reduced to nought,--
    And thus unjust the Almighty's self be thought.

                        LII.

    "But they in Christ have firmest hope, and all
      Which seems to Him, to them too must appear
    Well done; nor could it otherwise befall;
      He never can in any purpose err.
    If sire or mother suffer endless thrall,
      They don't disturb themselves for him or her:
    What pleases God to them must joy inspire;--
    Such is the observance of the eternal choir."

                        LIII.

    "A word unto the wise," Morgante said,
      "Is wont to be enough, and you shall see
    How much I grieve about my brethren dead;
      And if the will of God seem good to me,
    Just, as you tell me, 'tis in Heaven obeyed--
      Ashes to ashes,--merry let us be!
    I will cut off the hands from both their trunks,
    And carry them unto the holy monks.

                        LIV.

    "So that all persons may be sure and certain
      That they are dead, and have no further fear
    To wander solitary this desert in,
      And that they may perceive my spirit clear
    By the Lord's grace, who hath withdrawn the curtain
      Of darkness, making His bright realm appear."
    He cut his brethren's hands off at these words,
    And left them to the savage beasts and birds.

                        LV.

    Then to the abbey they went on together,
      Where waited them the Abbot in great doubt.
    The monks, who knew not yet the fact, ran thither
      To their superior, all in breathless rout,
    Saying with tremor, "Please to tell us whether
      You wish to have this person in or out?"
    The Abbot, looking through upon the Giant,
    Too greatly feared, at first, to be compliant.

                        LVI.

    Orlando seeing him thus agitated,
      Said quickly, "Abbot, be thou of good cheer;
    He Christ believes, as Christian must be rated,
      And hath renounced his Macon false;" which here
    Morgante with the hands corroborated,
      A proof of both the giants' fate quite clear:
    Thence, with due thanks, the Abbot God adored,
    Saying, "Thou hast contented me, O Lord!"

                        LVII.

    He gazed; Morgante's height he calculated,
      And more than once contemplated his size;
    And then he said, "O Giant celebrated!
      Know, that no more my wonder will arise,
    How you could tear and fling the trees you late did,
      When I behold your form with my own eyes.
    You now a true and perfect friend will show
    Yourself to Christ, as once you were a foe.

                        LVIII.

    "And one of our apostles, Saul once named,
      Long persecuted sore the faith of Christ,
    Till, one day, by the Spirit being inflamed,
      'Why dost thou persecute me thus?' said Christ;
    And then from his offence he was reclaimed,
      And went for ever after preaching Christ,
    And of the faith became a trump, whose sounding
    O'er the whole earth is echoing and rebounding.

                        LIX.

    "So, my Morgante, you may do likewise:
      He who repents--thus writes the Evangelist--
    Occasions more rejoicing in the skies
      Than ninety-nine of the celestial list.
    You may be sure, should each desire arise
      With just zeal for the Lord, that you'll exist
    Among the happy saints for evermore;
    But you were lost and damned to Hell before!"

                        LX.

    And thus great honour to Morgante paid
      The Abbot: many days they did repose.
    One day, as with Orlando they both strayed,
      And sauntered here and there, where'er they chose,
    The Abbot showed a chamber, where arrayed
      Much armour was, and hung up certain bows;
    And one of these Morgante for a whim
    Girt on, though useless, he believed, to him.

                        LXI.

    There being a want of water in the place,
      Orlando, like a worthy brother, said,
    "Morgante, I could wish you in this case
      To go for water." "You shall be obeyed
    In all commands," was the reply, "straight ways."
      Upon his shoulder a great tub he laid,
    And went out on his way unto a fountain,
    Where he was wont to drink, below the mountain.

                        LXII.

    Arrived there, a prodigious noise he hears,
      Which suddenly along the forest spread;
    Whereat from out his quiver he prepares
      An arrow for his bow, and lifts his head;
    And lo! a monstrous herd of swine appears,
      And onward rushes with tempestuous tread,
    And to the fountain's brink precisely pours;
    So that the Giant's joined by all the boars.

                        LXIII.

    Morgante at a venture shot an arrow,
      Which pierced a pig precisely in the ear,
    And passed unto the other side quite through;
      So that the boar, defunct, lay tripped up near.
    Another, to revenge his fellow farrow,
      Against the Giant rushed in fierce career,
    And reached the passage with so swift a foot,
    Morgante was not now in time to shoot.

                        LXIV.

    Perceiving that the pig was on him close,
      He gave him such a punch upon the head,
    As floored him so that he no more arose,
      Smashing the very bone; and he fell dead
    Next to the other. Having seen such blows,
      The other pigs along the valley fled;
    Morgante on his neck the bucket took,
    Full from the spring, which neither swerved nor shook.

                        LXV.

    The tub was on one shoulder, and there were
      The hogs on t'other, and he brushed apace
    On to the abbey, though by no means near,
      Nor spilt one drop of water in his race.
    Orlando, seeing him so soon appear
      With the dead boars, and with that brimful vase,
    Marvelled to see his strength so very great;
    So did the Abbot, and set wide the gate.

                        LXVI.

    The monks, who saw the water fresh and good,
      Rejoiced, but much more to perceive the pork;
    All animals are glad at sight of food:
      They lay their breviaries to sleep, and work
    With greedy pleasure, and in such a mood,
      That the flesh needs no salt beneath their fork.
    Of rankness and of rot there is no fear,
    For all the fasts are now left in arrear.

                        LXVII.

    As though they wished to burst at once, they ate;
      And gorged so that, as if the bones had been
    In water, sorely grieved the dog and cat,
      Perceiving that they all were picked too clean.
    The Abbot, who to all did honour great,
      A few days after this convivial scene,
    Gave to Morgante a fine horse, well trained,
    Which he long time had for himself maintained.

                        LXVIII.

    The horse Morgante to a meadow led,
      To gallop, and to put him to the proof,
    Thinking that he a back of iron had,
      Or to skim eggs unbroke was light enough;
    But the horse, sinking with the pain, fell dead,
      And burst, while cold on earth lay head and hoof.
    Morgante said, "Get up, thou sulky cur!"
    And still continued pricking with the spur.

                        LXIX.

    But finally he thought fit to dismount,
      And said, "I am as light as any feather,
    And he has burst;--to this what say you, Count?"
      Orlando answered, "Like a ship's mast rather
    You seem to me, and with the truck for front:
      Let him go! Fortune wills that we together
    Should march, but you on foot Morgante still."
    To which the Giant answered," So I will.

                        LXX.

    "When there shall be occasion, you will see
      How I approve my courage in the fight."
    Orlando said, "I really think you'll be,
      If it should prove God's will, a goodly knight;
    Nor will you napping there discover me.
      But never mind your horse, though out of sight
    'Twere best to carry him into some wood,
    If but the means or way I understood."

                        LXXI.

    The Giant said, "Then carry him I will,
      Since that to carry me he was so slack--
    To render, as the gods do, good for ill;
      But lend a hand to place him on my back."
    Orlando answered, "If my counsel still
      May weigh, Morgante, do not undertake
    To lift or carry this dead courser, who,
    As you have done to him, will do to you.

                        LXXII.

    "Take care he don't revenge himself, though dead,
      As Nessus did of old beyond all cure.
    I don't know if the fact you've heard or read;
      But he will make you burst, you may be sure."
    "But help him on my back," Morgante said,
      "And you shall see what weight I can endure.
    In place, my gentle Roland, of this palfrey,
    With all the bells, I'd carry yonder belfry."

                        LXXIII.

    The Abbot said, "The steeple may do well,
      But for the bells, you've broken them, I wot."
    Morgante answered, "Let them pay in Hell
      The penalty who lie dead in yon grot;"
    And hoisting up the horse from where he fell,
      He said, "Now look if I the gout have got,
    Orlando, in the legs,--or if I have force;"--
    And then he made two gambols with the horse.

                        LXXIV.

    Morgante was like any mountain framed;
      So if he did this 'tis no prodigy;
    But secretly himself Orlando blamed,
      Because he was one of his family;
    And fearing that he might be hurt or maimed,
      Once more he bade him lay his burden by:
    "Put down, nor bear him further the desert in."
    Morgante said, "I'll carry him for certain."

                        LXXV.

    He did; and stowed him in some nook away,
      And to the abbey then returned with speed.
    Orlando said, "Why longer do we stay?
      Morgante, here is nought to do indeed."
    The Abbot by the hand he took one day,
      And said, with great respect, he had agreed
    To leave his reverence; but for this decision
    He wished to have his pardon and permission.

                        LXXVI.

    The honours they continued to receive
      Perhaps exceeded what his merits claimed:
    He said, "I mean, and quickly, to retrieve
      The lost days of time past, which may be blamed;
    Some days ago I should have asked your leave,
      Kind father, but I really was ashamed,
    And know not how to show my sentiment,
    So much I see you with our stay content.

                        LXXVII.

    "But in my heart I bear through every clime
      The Abbot, abbey, and this solitude--
    So much I love you in so short a time;
      For me, from Heaven reward you with all good
    The God so true, the eternal Lord sublime!
      Whose kingdom at the last hath open stood.
    Meantime we stand expectant of your blessing.
    And recommend us to your prayers with pressing."

                        LXXVIII.

    Now when the Abbot Count Orlando heard,
      His heart grew soft with inner tenderness,
    Such fervour in his bosom bred each word;
      And, "Cavalier," he said, "if I have less
    Courteous and kind to your great worth appeared,
      Than fits me for such gentle blood to express,
    I know I have done too little in this case;
    But blame our ignorance, and this poor place.

                        LXXIX.

    "We can indeed but honour you with masses,
      And sermons, thanksgivings, and pater-nosters,
    Hot suppers, dinners (fitting other places
      In verity much rather than the cloisters);
    But such a love for you my heart embraces,
      For thousand virtues which your bosom fosters,
    That wheresoe'er you go I too shall be,
    And, on the other part, you rest with me.

                        LXXX.

    "This may involve a seeming contradiction;
      But you I know are sage, and feel, and taste,
    And understand my speech with full conviction.
      For your just pious deeds may you be graced
    With the Lord's great reward and benediction,
      By whom you were directed to this waste:
    To His high mercy is our freedom due,
    For which we render thanks to Him and you.

                        LXXXI.

    "You saved at once our life and soul: such fear
      The Giants caused us, that the way was lost
    By which we could pursue a fit career
      In search of Jesus and the saintly Host;
    And your departure breeds such sorrow here,
      That comfortless we all are to our cost;
    But months and years you would not stay in sloth,
    Nor are you formed to wear our sober cloth,

                        LXXXII.

    "But to bear arms, and wield the lance; indeed,
      With these as much is done as with this cowl;
    In proof of which the Scripture you may read,
      This Giant up to Heaven may bear his soul
    By your compassion: now in peace proceed.
      Your state and name I seek not to unroll;
    But, if I'm asked, this answer shall be given,
    That here an angel was sent down from Heaven.

                        LXXXIII.

    "If you want armour or aught else, go in,
      Look o'er the wardrobe, and take what you choose,
    And cover with it o'er this Giant's skin."
      Orlando answered, "If there should lie loose
    Some armour, ere our journey we begin,
      Which might be turned to my companion's use,
    The gift would be acceptable to me."
    The Abbot said to him, "Come in and see."

                        LXXXIV.

    And in a certain closet, where the wall
      Was covered with old armour like a crust,
    The Abbot said to them, "I give you all."
      Morgante rummaged piecemeal from the dust
    The whole, which, save one cuirass, was too small,
      And that too had the mail inlaid with rust.
    They wondered how it fitted him exactly,
    Which ne'er had suited others so compactly.

                        LXXXV.

    'Twas an immeasurable Giant's, who
      By the great Milo of Agrante fell
    Before the abbey many years ago.
      The story on the wall was figured well;
    In the last moment of the abbey's foe,
      Who long had waged a war implacable:
    Precisely as the war occurred they drew him,
    And there was Milo as he overthrew him.

                        LXXXVI.

    Seeing this history, Count Orlando said
      In his own heart, "O God who in the sky
    Know'st all things! how was Milo hither led?
      Who caused the Giant in this place to die?"
    And certain letters, weeping, then he read,
      So that he could not keep his visage dry,--
    As I will tell in the ensuing story:
    From evil keep you the high King of Glory!

                            FRANCESCA OF RIMINI.
                   
                        FROM THE INFERNO OF DANTE.

                             CANTO THE FIFTH.

    "The Land where I was born sits by the Seas
      Upon that shore to which the Po descends,
      With all his followers, in search of peace.
    Love, which the gentle heart soon apprehends,
      Seized him for the fair person which was ta'en
      From me, and me even yet the mode offends.
    Love, who to none beloved to love again
      Remits, seized me with wish to please, so strong,
      That, as thou see'st, yet, yet it doth remain.
    Love to one death conducted us along,
      But Caina waits for him our life who ended:"
      These were the accents uttered by her tongue.--
    Since I first listened to these Souls offended,
      I bowed my visage, and so kept it till--
      'What think'st thou?' said the bard; when I unbended,
    And recommenced: 'Alas! unto such ill
      How many sweet thoughts, what strong ecstacies,
      Led these their evil fortune to fulfill!'
    And then I turned unto their side my eyes,
      And said, 'Francesca, thy sad destinies
      Have made me sorrow till the tears arise.
    But tell me, in the Season of sweet sighs,
      By what and how thy Love to Passion rose,
      So as his dim desires to recognize?'
    Then she to me: 'The greatest of all woes
      Is to remind us of our happy days
      In misery, and that thy teacher knows.
    But if to learn our Passion's first root preys
      Upon thy spirit with such Sympathy,
      I will do even as he who weeps and says.
    We read one day for pastime, seated nigh,
      Of Lancilot, how Love enchained him too.
      We were alone, quite unsuspiciously.
    But oft our eyes met, and our Cheeks in hue
      All o'er discoloured by that reading were;
      But one point only wholly us o'erthrew;
    When we read the long-sighed-for smile of her,
      To be thus kissed by such devoted lover,
      He, who from me can be divided ne'er,
    Kissed my mouth, trembling in the act all over:
      Accursed was the book and he who wrote!
      That day no further leaf we did uncover.'
    While thus one Spirit told us of their lot,
      The other wept, so that with Pity's thralls
      I swooned, as if by Death I had been smote,
    And fell down even as a dead body falls."
                                                                                   
                          THE VISION OF JUDGMENT.

                                     BY

                             QUEVEDO REDIVIVUS.

          SUGGESTED BY THE COMPOSITION SO ENTITLED BY THE AUTHOR
                              OF "WAT TYLER."

    "A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
    I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word."
                    
                       THE VISION OF JUDGMENT.

                        I.

    Saint Peter sat by the celestial gate:
      His keys were rusty, and the lock was dull,
    So little trouble had been given of late;
      Not that the place by any means was full,
    But since the Gallic era "eighty-eight"
      The Devils had ta'en a longer, stronger pull,
    And "a pull altogether," as they say
    At sea--which drew most souls another way.

                        II.

    The Angels all were singing out of tune,
      And hoarse with having little else to do,
    Excepting to wind up the sun and moon,
      Or curb a runaway young star or two,
    Or wild colt of a comet, which too soon
      Broke out of bounds o'er the ethereal blue,
    Splitting some planet with its playful tail,
    As boats are sometimes by a wanton whale.

                        III.

    The Guardian Seraphs had retired on high,
      Finding their charges past all care below;
    Terrestrial business filled nought in the sky
      Save the Recording Angel's black bureau;
    Who found, indeed, the facts to multiply
      With such rapidity of vice and woe,
    That he had stripped off both his wings in quills,
    And yet was in arrear of human ills.

                        IV.

    His business so augmented of late years,
      That he was forced, against his will, no doubt,
    (Just like those cherubs, earthly ministers,)
      For some resource to turn himself about,
    And claim the help of his celestial peers,
      To aid him ere he should be quite worn out
    By the increased demand for his remarks:
    Six Angels and twelve Saints were named his clerks.

                        V.

    This was a handsome board--at least for Heaven;
      And yet they had even then enough to do,
    So many Conquerors' cars were daily driven,
      So many kingdoms fitted up anew;
    Each day, too, slew its thousands six or seven,
      Till at the crowning carnage, Waterloo,
    They threw their pens down in divine disgust--
    The page was so besmeared with blood and dust.

                        VI.

    This by the way; 'tis not mine to record
      What Angels shrink from: even the very Devil
    On this occasion his own work abhorred,
      So surfeited with the infernal revel:
    Though he himself had sharpened every sword,
      It almost quenched his innate thirst of evil.
    (Here Satan's sole good work deserves insertion--
    'Tis, that he has both Generals in reversion.)

                        VII.

    Let's skip a few short years of hollow peace,
      Which peopled earth no better, Hell as wont,
    And Heaven none--they form the tyrant's lease,
      With nothing but new names subscribed upon't;
    'Twill one day finish: meantime they increase,
      "With seven heads and ten horns," and all in front,
    Like Saint John's foretold beast; but ours are born
    Less formidable in the head than horn.

                        VIII.

    In the first year of Freedom's second dawn
      Died George the Third; although no tyrant, one
    Who shielded tyrants, till each sense withdrawn
      Left him nor mental nor external sun:
    A better farmer ne'er brushed dew from lawn,
      A worse king never left a realm undone!
    He died--but left his subjects still behind,
    One half as mad--and t'other no less blind.

                        IX.

    He died! his death made no great stir on earth:
      His burial made some pomp; there was profusion
    Of velvet--gilding--brass--and no great dearth
      Of aught but tears--save those shed by collusion:
    For these things may be bought at their true worth;
      Of elegy there was the due infusion--
    Bought also; and the torches, cloaks and banners,
    Heralds, and relics of old Gothic manners,

                        X.

    Formed a sepulchral melodrame. Of all
      The fools who flocked to swell or see the show,
    Who cared about the corpse? The funeral
      Made the attraction, and the black the woe,
    There throbbed not there a thought which pierced the pall;
      And when the gorgeous coffin was laid low,
    It seemed the mockery of hell to fold
    The rottenness of eighty years in gold.

                        XI.

    So mix his body with the dust! It might
      Return to what it must far sooner, were
    The natural compound left alone to fight
      Its way back into earth, and fire, and air;
    But the unnatural balsams merely blight
      What Nature made him at his birth, as bare
    As the mere million's base unmummied clay--
    Yet all his spices but prolong decay.

                        XII.

    He's dead--and upper earth with him has done;
      He's buried; save the undertaker's bill,
    Or lapidary scrawl, the world is gone
      For him, unless he left a German will:
    But where's the proctor who will ask his son?
      In whom his qualities are reigning still,
    Except that household virtue, most uncommon,
    Of constancy to a bad, ugly woman.

                        XIII.

    "God save the king!" It is a large economy
      In God to save the like; but if he will
    Be saving, all the better; for not one am I
      Of those who think damnation better still:
    I hardly know too if not quite alone am I
      In this small hope of bettering future ill
    By circumscribing, with some slight restriction,
    The eternity of Hell's hot jurisdiction.

                        XIV.

    I know this is unpopular; I know
      'Tis blasphemous; I know one may be damned
    For hoping no one else may e'er be so;
      I know my catechism; I know we're crammed
    With the best doctrines till we quite o'erflow;
      I know that all save England's Church have shammed,
    And that the other twice two hundred churches
    And synagogues have made a damned bad purchase.

                        XV.

    God help us all! God help me too! I am,
      God knows, as helpless as the Devil can wish,
    And not a whit more difficult to damn,
      Than is to bring to land a late-hooked fish,
    Or to the butcher to purvey the lamb;
      Not that I'm fit for such a noble dish,
    As one day will be that immortal fry
    Of almost every body born to die.

                        XVI.

    Saint Peter sat by the celestial gate,
      And nodded o'er his keys: when, lo! there came
    A wondrous noise he had not heard of late--
      A rushing sound of wind, and stream, and flame;
    In short, a roar of things extremely great,
      Which would have made aught save a Saint exclaim;
    But he, with first a start and then a wink,
    Said, "There's another star gone out, I think!"

                        XVII.

    But ere he could return to his repose,
      A Cherub flapped his right wing o'er his eyes--
    At which Saint Peter yawned, and rubbed his nose:
      "Saint porter," said the angel, "prithee rise!"
    Waving a goodly wing, which glowed, as glows
      An earthly peacock's tail, with heavenly dyes:
    To which the saint replied, "Well, what's the matter?
    "Is Lucifer come back with all this clatter?"

                        XVIII.

    "No," quoth the Cherub: "George the Third is dead."
      "And who is George the Third?" replied the apostle:
    "What George? what Third?" "The King of England," said
      The angel. "Well! he won't find kings to jostle
    Him on his way; but does he wear his head?
      Because the last we saw here had a tustle,
    And ne'er would have got into Heaven's good graces,
    Had he not flung his head in all our faces.

                        XIX.

    "He was--if I remember--King of France;
      That head of his, which could not keep a crown
    On earth, yet ventured in my face to advance
      A claim to those of martyrs--like my own:
    If I had had my sword, as I had once
      When I cut ears off, I had cut him down;
    But having but my keys, and not my brand,
    I only knocked his head from out his hand.

                        XX.

    "And then he set up such a headless howl,
      That all the Saints came out and took him in;
    And there he sits by Saint Paul, cheek by jowl;
      That fellow Paul--the parvenu! The skin
    Of Saint Bartholomew, which makes his cowl
      In heaven, and upon earth redeemed his sin,
    So as to make a martyr, never sped
    Better than did this weak and wooden head.

                        XXI.

    "But had it come up here upon its shoulders,
      There would have been a different tale to tell:
    The fellow-feeling in the Saint's beholders
      Seems to have acted on them like a spell;
    And so this very foolish head Heaven solders
      Back on its trunk: it may be very well,
    And seems the custom here to overthrow
    Whatever has been wisely done below."

                        XXII.

    The Angel answered, "Peter! do not pout:
      The King who comes has head and all entire,
    And never knew much what it was about--
      He did as doth the puppet--by its wire,
    And will be judged like all the rest, no doubt:
      My business and your own is not to inquire
    Into such matters, but to mind our cue--
    Which is to act as we are bid to do."

                        XXIII.

    While thus they spake, the angelic caravan,
      Arriving like a rush of mighty wind,
    Cleaving the fields of space, as doth the swan
      Some silver stream (say Ganges, Nile, or Inde,
    Or Thames, or Tweed), and midst them an old man
      With an old soul, and both extremely blind,
    Halted before the gate, and, in his shroud,
    Seated their fellow-traveller on a cloud.

                        XXIV.

    But bringing up the rear of this bright host
      A Spirit of a different aspect waved
    His wings, like thunder-clouds above some coast
      Whose barren beach with frequent wrecks is paved;
    His brow was like the deep when tempest-tossed;
      Fierce and unfathomable thoughts engraved
    Eternal wrath on his immortal face,
    And where he gazed a gloom pervaded space.

                        XXV.

    As he drew near, he gazed upon the gate
      Ne'er to be entered more by him or Sin,
    With such a glance of supernatural hate,
      As made Saint Peter wish himself within;
    He pottered with his keys at a great rate,
      And sweated through his Apostolic skin:
    Of course his perspiration was but ichor,
    Or some such other spiritual liquor.

                        XXVI.

    The very Cherubs huddled all together,
      Like birds when soars the falcon; and they felt
    A tingling to the tip of every feather,
      And formed a circle like Orion's belt
    Around their poor old charge; who scarce knew whither
      His guards had led him, though they gently dealt
    With royal Manes (for by many stories,
    And true, we learn the Angels all are Tories).

                        XXVII.

    As things were in this posture, the gate flew
      Asunder, and the flashing of its hinges
    Flung over space an universal hue
      Of many-coloured flame, until its tinges
    Reached even our speck of earth, and made a new
      Aurora borealis spread its fringes
    O'er the North Pole; the same seen, when ice-bound,
    By Captain Parry's crew, in "Melville's Sound."

                        XXVIII.

    And from the gate thrown open issued beaming
      A beautiful and mighty Thing of Light,
    Radiant with glory, like a banner streaming
      Victorious from some world-o'erthrowing fight:
    My poor comparisons must needs be teeming
      With earthly likenesses, for here the night
    Of clay obscures our best conceptions, saving
    Johanna Southcote, or Bob Southey raving.

                        XXIX.

    'Twas the Archangel Michael: all men know
      The make of Angels and Archangels, since
    There's scarce a scribbler has not one to show,
      From the fiends' leader to the Angels' Prince.
    There also are some altar-pieces, though
      I really can't say that they much evince
    One's inner notions of immortal spirits;
    But let the connoisseurs explain their merits.

                        XXX.

    Michael flew forth in glory and in good;
      A goodly work of him from whom all Glory
    And Good arise; the portal past--he stood;
      Before him the young Cherubs and Saints hoary--
    (I say young, begging to be understood
      By looks, not years; and should be very sorry
    To state, they were not older than St. Peter,
    But merely that they seemed a little sweeter).

                        XXXI.

    The Cherubs and the Saints bowed down before
      That arch-angelic Hierarch, the first
    Of Essences angelical who wore
      The aspect of a god; but this ne'er nursed
    Pride in his heavenly bosom, in whose core
      No thought, save for his Maker's service, durst
    Intrude, however glorified and high;
    He knew him but the Viceroy of the sky.

                        XXXII.

    He and the sombre, silent Spirit met--
      They knew each other both for good and ill;
    Such was their power, that neither could forget
      His former friend and future foe; but still
    There was a high, immortal, proud regret
      In either's eye, as if 'twere less their will
    Than destiny to make the eternal years
    Their date of war, and their "Champ Clos" the spheres.

                        XXXIII.

    But here they were in neutral space: we know
      From Job, that Satan hath the power to pay
    A heavenly visit thrice a-year or so;
      And that the "Sons of God," like those of clay,
    Must keep him company; and we might show
      From the same book, in how polite a way
    The dialogue is held between the Powers
    Of Good and Evil--but 'twould take up hours.

                        XXXIV.

    And this is not a theologic tract,
      To prove with Hebrew and with Arabic,
    If Job be allegory or a fact,
      But a true narrative; and thus I pick
    From out the whole but such and such an act
      As sets aside the slightest thought of trick.
    'Tis every tittle true, beyond suspicion,
    And accurate as any other vision.

                        XXXV.

    The spirits were in neutral space, before
      The gate of Heaven; like eastern thresholds is
    The place where Death's grand cause is argued o'er,
      And souls despatched to that world or to this;
    And therefore Michael and the other wore
      A civil aspect: though they did not kiss,
    Yet still between his Darkness and his Brightness
    There passed a mutual glance of great politeness.

                        XXXVI.

    The Archangel bowed, not like a modern beau,
      But with a graceful oriental bend,
    Pressing one radiant arm just where below
      The heart in good men is supposed to tend;
    He turned as to an equal, not too low,
      But kindly; Satan met his ancient friend
    With more hauteur, as might an old Castilian
    Poor Noble meet a mushroom rich civilian.

                        XXXVII.

    He merely bent his diabolic brow
      An instant; and then raising it, he stood
    In act to assert his right or wrong, and show
      Cause why King George by no means could or should
    Make out a case to be exempt from woe
      Eternal, more than other kings, endued
    With better sense and hearts, whom History mentions,
    Who long have "paved Hell with their good intentions."

                        XXXVIII.

    Michael began: "What wouldst thou with this man,
      Now dead, and brought before the Lord? What ill
    Hath he wrought since his mortal race began,
      That thou canst claim him? Speak! and do thy will,
    If it be just: if in this earthly span
      He hath been greatly failing to fulfil
    His duties as a king and mortal, say,
    And he is thine; if not--let him have way."

                        XXXIX.

    "Michael!" replied the Prince of Air, "even here
      Before the gate of Him thou servest, must
    I claim my subject: and will make appear
      That as he was my worshipper in dust,
    So shall he be in spirit, although dear
      To thee and thine, because nor wine nor lust
    Were of his weaknesses; yet on the throne
    He reigned o'er millions to serve me alone.

                        XL.

    "Look to our earth, or rather mine; it was,
      Once, more thy master's: but I triumph not
    In this poor planet's conquest; nor, alas!
      Need he thou servest envy me my lot:
    With all the myriads of bright worlds which pass
      In worship round him, he may have forgot
    Yon weak creation of such paltry things:
    I think few worth damnation save their kings,

                        XLI.

    "And these but as a kind of quit-rent, to
      Assert my right as Lord: and even had
    I such an inclination,'twere (as you
      Well know) superfluous; they are grown so bad,
    That Hell has nothing better left to do
      Than leave them to themselves: so much more mad
    And evil by their own internal curse,
    Heaven cannot make them better, nor I worse.

                        XLII.

    "Look to the earth, I said, and say again:
      When this old, blind, mad, helpless, weak, poor worm
    Began in youth's first bloom and flush to reign,
      The world and he both wore a different form,
    And much of earth and all the watery plain
      Of Ocean called him king: through many a storm
    His isles had floated on the abyss of Time;
    For the rough virtues chose them for their clime.

                        XLIII.

    "He came to his sceptre young; he leaves it old:
      Look to the state in which he found his realm,
    And left it; and his annals too behold,
      How to a minion first he gave the helm;
    How grew upon his heart a thirst for gold,
      The beggar's vice, which can but overwhelm
    The meanest hearts; and for the rest, but glance
    Thine eye along America and France.

                        XLIV.

    "'Tis true, he was a tool from first to last
      (I have the workmen safe); but as a tool
    So let him be consumed. From out the past
      Of ages, since mankind have known the rule
    Of monarchs--from the bloody rolls amassed
      Of Sin and Slaughter--from the Caesars' school,
    Take the worst pupil; and produce a reign
    More drenched with gore, more cumbered with the slain.

                        XLV.

    "He ever warred with freedom and the free:
      Nations as men, home subjects, foreign foes,
    So that they uttered the word 'Liberty!'
      Found George the Third their first opponent. Whose
    History was ever stained as his will be
      With national and individual woes?
    I grant his household abstinence; I grant
    His neutral virtues, which most monarchs want;

                        XLVI.

    "I know he was a constant consort; own
      He was a decent sire, and middling lord.
    All this is much, and most upon a throne;
      As temperance, if at Apicius' board,
    Is more than at an anchorite's supper shown.
      I grant him all the kindest can accord;
    And this was well for him, but not for those
    Millions who found him what Oppression chose.

                        XLVII.

    "The New World shook him off; the Old yet groans
      Beneath what he and his prepared, if not
    Completed: he leaves heirs on many thrones
      To all his vices, without what begot
    Compassion for him--his tame virtues; drones
      Who sleep, or despots who have now forgot
    A lesson which shall be re-taught them, wake
    Upon the thrones of earth; but let them quake!

                        XLVIII.

    "Five millions of the primitive, who hold
      The faith which makes ye great on earth, implored
    A part of that vast all they held of old,--
      Freedom to worship--not alone your Lord,
    Michael, but you, and you, Saint Peter! Cold
      Must be your souls, if you have not abhorred
    The foe to Catholic participation
    In all the license of a Christian nation.

                        XLIX.

    "True! he allowed them to pray God; but as
      A consequence of prayer, refused the law
    Which would have placed them upon the same base
      With those who did not hold the Saints in awe."
    But here Saint Peter started from his place
      And cried, "You may the prisoner withdraw:
    Ere Heaven shall ope her portals to this Guelph,
    While I am guard, may I be damned myself!

                        L.

    "Sooner will I with Cerberus exchange
      My office (and his is no sinecure)
    Than see this royal Bedlam-bigot range
      The azure fields of Heaven, of that be sure!"
    "Saint!" replied Satan, "you do well to avenge
      The wrongs he made your satellites endure;
    And if to this exchange you should be given,
    I'll try to coax our Cerberus up to Heaven!"

                        LI.

    Here Michael interposed: "Good Saint! and Devil!
      Pray, not so fast; you both outrun discretion.
    Saint Peter! you were wont to be more civil:
      Satan! excuse this warmth of his expression,
    And condescension to the vulgar's level:
      Even Saints sometimes forget themselves in session.
    Have you got more to say?"--"No."--"If you please,
    I'll trouble you to call your witnesses."

                        LII.

    Then Satan turned and waved his swarthy hand,
      Which stirred with its electric qualities
    Clouds farther off than we can understand,
      Although we find him sometimes in our skies;
    Infernal thunder shook both sea and land
      In all the planets--and Hell's batteries
    Let off the artillery, which Milton mentions
    As one of Satan's most sublime inventions.

                        LIII.

    This was a signal unto such damned souls
      As have the privilege of their damnation
    Extended far beyond the mere controls
      Of worlds past, present, or to come; no station
    Is theirs particularly in the rolls
      Of Hell assigned; but where their inclination
    Or business carries them in search of game,
    They may range freely--being damned the same.

                        LIV.

    They are proud of this--as very well they may,
      It being a sort of knighthood, or gilt key
    Stuck in their loins; or like to an "entre"
      Up the back stairs, or such free-masonry.
    I borrow my comparisons from clay,
      Being clay myself. Let not those spirits be
    Offended with such base low likenesses;
    We know their posts are nobler far than these.

                        LV.

    When the great signal ran from Heaven to Hell--
      About ten million times the distance reckoned
    From our sun to its earth, as we can tell
      How much time it takes up, even to a second,
    For every ray that travels to dispel
      The fogs of London, through which, dimly beaconed,
    The weathercocks are gilt some thrice a year,
    If that the summer is not too severe:

                        LVI.

    I say that I can tell--'twas half a minute;
      I know the solar beams take up more time
    Ere, packed up for their journey, they begin it;
      But then their Telegraph is less sublime,
    And if they ran a race, they would not win it
      'Gainst Satan's couriers bound for their own clime.
    The sun takes up some years for every ray
    To reach its goal--the Devil not half a day.

                        LVII.

    Upon the verge of space, about the size
      Of half-a-crown, a little speck appeared
    (I've seen a something like it in the skies
      In the Aegean, ere a squall); it neared,
    And, growing bigger, took another guise;
      Like an aerial ship it tacked, and steered,
    Or was steered (I am doubtful of the grammar
    Of the last phrase, which makes the stanza stammer;

                        LVIII.

    But take your choice): and then it grew a cloud;
      And so it was--a cloud of witnesses.
    But such a cloud! No land ere saw a crowd
      Of locusts numerous as the heavens saw these;
    They shadowed with their myriads Space; their loud
      And varied cries were like those of wild geese,
    (If nations may be likened to a goose),
    And realised the phrase of "Hell broke loose."

                        LIX.

    Here crashed a sturdy oath of stout John Bull,
      Who damned away his eyes as heretofore:
    There Paddy brogued "By Jasus!"--"What's your wull?"
      The temperate Scot exclaimed: the French ghost swore
    In certain terms I shan't translate in full,
      As the first coachman will; and 'midst the war,
    The voice of Jonathan was heard to express,
    "Our President is going to war, I guess."

                        LX.

    Besides there were the Spaniard, Dutch, and Dane;
      In short, an universal shoal of shades
    From Otaheite's isle to Salisbury Plain,
      Of all climes and professions, years and trades,
    Ready to swear against the good king's reign,
      Bitter as clubs in cards are against spades:
    All summoned by this grand "subpoena," to
    Try if kings mayn't be damned like me or you.

                        LXI.

    When Michael saw this host, he first grew pale,
      As Angels can; next, like Italian twilight,
    He turned all colours--as a peacock's tail,
      Or sunset streaming through a Gothic skylight
    In some old abbey, or a trout not stale,
      Or distant lightning on the horizon by night,
    Or a fresh rainbow, or a grand review
    Of thirty regiments in red, green, and blue.

                        LXII.

    Then he addressed himself to Satan: "Why--
      My good old friend, for such I deem you, though
    Our different parties make us fight so shy,
      I ne'er mistake you for a personal foe;
    Our difference political, and I
      Trust that, whatever may occur below,
    You know my great respect for you: and this
    Makes me regret whate'er you do amiss--

                        LXIII.

    "Why, my dear Lucifer, would you abuse
      My call for witnesses? I did not mean
    That you should half of Earth and Hell produce;
      'Tis even superfluous, since two honest, clean,
    True testimonies are enough: we lose
      Our Time, nay, our Eternity, between
    The accusation and defence: if we
    Hear both, 'twill stretch our immortality."

                        LXIV.

    Satan replied, "To me the matter is
      Indifferent, in a personal point of view:
    I can have fifty better souls than this
      With far less trouble than we have gone through
    Already; and I merely argued his
      Late Majesty of Britain's case with you
    Upon a point of form: you may dispose
    Of him; I've kings enough below, God knows!"

                        LXV.

    Thus spoke the Demon (late called "multifaced"
      By multo-scribbling Southey). "Then we'll call
    One or two persons of the myriads placed
      Around our congress, and dispense with all
    The rest," quoth Michael: "Who may be so graced
      As to speak first? there's choice enough--who shall
    It be?" Then Satan answered, "There are many;
    But you may choose Jack Wilkes as well as any."

                        LXVI.

    A merry, cock-eyed, curious-looking Sprite
      Upon the instant started from the throng,
    Dressed in a fashion now forgotten quite;
      For all the fashions of the flesh stick long
    By people in the next world; where unite
      All the costumes since Adam's, right or wrong,
    From Eve's fig-leaf down to the petticoat,
    Almost as scanty, of days less remote.

                        LXVII.

    The Spirit looked around upon the crowds
      Assembled, and exclaimed, "My friends of all
    The spheres, we shall catch cold amongst these clouds;
      So let's to business: why this general call?
    If those are freeholders I see in shrouds,
      And 'tis for an election that they bawl,
    Behold a candidate with unturned coat!
    Saint Peter, may I count upon your vote?"

                        LXVIII.

    "Sir," replied Michael, "you mistake; these things
      Are of a former life, and what we do
    Above is more august; to judge of kings
      Is the tribunal met: so now you know."
    "Then I presume those gentlemen with wings,"
      Said Wilkes, "are Cherubs; and that soul below
    Looks much like George the Third, but to my mind
    A good deal older--bless me! is he blind?"

                        LXIX.

    "He is what you behold him, and his doom
      Depends upon his deeds," the Angel said;
    "If you have aught to arraign in him, the tomb
      Gives license to the humblest beggar's head
    To lift itself against the loftiest."--"Some,"
      Said Wilkes, "don't wait to see them laid in lead,
    For such a liberty--and I, for one,
    Have told them what I thought beneath the sun."

                        LXX.

    "Above the sun repeat, then, what thou hast
      To urge against him," said the Archangel. "Why,"
    Replied the spirit, "since old scores are past,
      Must I turn evidence? In faith, not I.
    Besides, I beat him hollow at the last,
      With all his Lords and Commons: in the sky
    I don't like ripping up old stories, since
    His conduct was but natural in a prince.

                        LXXI.

    "Foolish, no doubt, and wicked, to oppress
      A poor unlucky devil without a shilling;
    But then I blame the man himself much less
      Than Bute and Grafton, and shall be unwilling
    To see him punished here for their excess,
      Since they were both damned long ago, and still in
    Their place below: for me, I have forgiven,
    And vote his habeas corpus into Heaven."

                        LXXII.

    "Wilkes," said the Devil, "I understand all this;
      You turned to half a courtier ere you died,
    And seem to think it would not be amiss
      To grow a whole one on the other side
    Of Charon's ferry; you forget that his
      Reign is concluded; whatsoe'er betide,
    He won't be sovereign more: you've lost your labour,
    For at the best he will but be your neighbour.

                        LXXIII.

    "However, I knew what to think of it,
      When I beheld you in your jesting way,
    Flitting and whispering round about the spit
      Where Belial, upon duty for the day,
    With Fox's lard was basting William Pitt,
      His pupil; I knew what to think, I say:
    That fellow even in Hell breeds farther ills;
    I'll have him gagged--'twas one of his own Bills.

                        LXXIV.

    "Call Junius!" From the crowd a shadow stalked.
      And at the name there was a general squeeze,
    So that the very ghosts no longer walked
      In comfort, at their own aerial ease,
    But were all rammed, and jammed (but to be balked,
      As we shall see), and jostled hands and knees,
    Like wind compressed and pent within a bladder,
    Or like a human colic, which is sadder.

                        LXXV.

    The shadow came--a tall, thin, grey-haired figure,
      That looked as it had been a shade on earth;
    Quick in its motions, with an air of vigour,
      But nought to mark its breeding or its birth;
    Now it waxed little, then again grew bigger,
      With now an air of gloom, or savage mirth:
    But as you gazed upon its features, they
    Changed every instant--to what, none could say.

                        LXXVI.

    The more intently the ghosts gazed, the less
      Could they distinguish whose the features were;
    The Devil himself seemed puzzled even to guess;
      They varied like a dream--now here, now there;
    And several people swore from out the press,
      They knew him perfectly; and one could swear
    He was his father; upon which another
    Was sure he was his mother's cousin's brother:

                        LXXVII.

    Another, that he was a duke, or knight,
      An orator, a lawyer, or a priest,
    A nabob, a man-midwife; but the wight
      Mysterious changed his countenance at least
    As oft as they their minds: though in full sight
      He stood, the puzzle only was increased;
    The man was a phantasmagoria in
    Himself--he was so volatile and thin.

                        LXXVIII.

    The moment that you had pronounced him one,
      Presto! his face changed, and he was another;
    And when that change was hardly well put on,
      It varied, till I don't think his own mother
    (If that he had a mother) would her son
      Have known, he shifted so from one to t'other;
    Till guessing from a pleasure grew a task,
    At this epistolary "Iron Mask."

                        LXXIX.

    For sometimes he like Cerberus would seem--
      "Three gentlemen at once" (as sagely says
    Good Mrs. Malaprop); then you might deem
      That he was not even one; now many rays
    Were flashing round him; and now a thick steam
      Hid him from sight--like fogs on London days:
    Now Burke, now Tooke, he grew to people's fancies
    And certes often like Sir Philip Francis.

                        LXXX.

    I've an hypothesis--'tis quite my own;
      I never let it out till now, for fear
    Of doing people harm about the throne,
      And injuring some minister or peer,
    On whom the stigma might perhaps be blown;
      It is--my gentle public, lend thine ear!
    'Tis, that what Junius we are wont to call,
    Was really--truly--nobody at all.

                        LXXXI.

    I don't see wherefore letters should not be
      Written without hands, since we daily view
    Them written without heads; and books, we see,
      Are filled as well without the latter too:
    And really till we fix on somebody
      For certain sure to claim them as his due,
    Their author, like the Niger's mouth, will bother
    The world to say if there be mouth or author.

                        LXXXII.

    "And who and what art thou?" the Archangel said.
      "For that you may consult my title-page,"
    Replied this mighty shadow of a shade:
      "If I have kept my secret half an age,
    I scarce shall tell it now."--"Canst thou upbraid,"
      Continued Michael, "George Rex, or allege
    Aught further?" Junius answered, "You had better
    First ask him for his answer to my letter:

                        LXXXIII.

    "My charges upon record will outlast
      The brass of both his epitaph and tomb."
    "Repent'st thou not," said Michael, "of some past
      Exaggeration? something which may doom
    Thyself if false, as him if true? Thou wast
      Too bitter--is it not so?--in thy gloom
    Of passion?"--"Passion!" cried the phantom dim,
    "I loved my country, and I hated him.

                        LXXXIV.

    "What I have written, I have written: let
      The rest be on his head or mine!" So spoke
    Old "Nominis Umbra;" and while speaking yet,
      Away he melted in celestial smoke.
    Then Satan said to Michael, "Don't forget
      To call George Washington, and John Horne Tooke,
    And Franklin;"--but at this time there was heard
    A cry for room, though not a phantom stirred.

                        LXXXV.

    At length with jostling, elbowing, and the aid
      Of Cherubim appointed to that post,
    The devil Asmodeus to the circle made
      His way, and looked as if his journey cost
    Some trouble. When his burden down he laid,
      "What's this?" cried Michael; "why, 'tis not a ghost?"
    "I know it," quoth the Incubus; "but he
    Shall be one, if you leave the affair to me.

                        LXXXVI.

    "Confound the renegado! I have sprained
      My left wing, he's so heavy; one would think
    Some of his works about his neck were chained.
      But to the point; while hovering o'er the brink
    Of Skiddaw (where as usual it still rained),
      I saw a taper, far below me, wink,
    And stooping, caught this fellow at a libel--
    No less on History--than the Holy Bible.

                        LXXXVII.

    "The former is the Devil's scripture, and
      The latter yours, good Michael: so the affair
    Belongs to all of us, you understand.
      I snatched him up just as you see him there,
    And brought him off for sentence out of hand:
      I've scarcely been ten minutes in the air--
    At least a quarter it can hardly be:
    I dare say that his wife is still at tea."

                        LXXXVIII.

    Here Satan said, "I know this man of old,
      And have expected him for some time here;
    A sillier fellow you will scarce behold,
      Or more conceited in his petty sphere:
    But surely it was not worth while to fold
      Such trash below your wing, Asmodeus dear:
    We had the poor wretch safe (without being bored
    With carriage) coming of his own accord.

                        LXXXIX.

    "But since he's here, let's see what he has done."
      "Done!" cried Asmodeus, "he anticipates
    The very business you are now upon,
      And scribbles as if head clerk to the Fates.
    Who knows to what his ribaldry may run,
      When such an ass as this, like Balaam's, prates?"
    "Let's hear," quoth Michael, "what he has to say:
    You know we're bound to that in every way."

                        XC.

    Now the bard, glad to get an audience, which
      By no means often was his case below,
    Began to cough, and hawk, and hem, and pitch
      His voice into that awful note of woe
    To all unhappy hearers within reach
      Of poets when the tide of rhyme's in flow;
    But stuck fast with his first hexameter,
    Not one of all whose gouty feet would stir.

                        XCI.

    But ere the spavined dactyls could be spurred
      Into recitative, in great dismay
    Both Cherubim and Seraphim were heard
      To murmur loudly through their long array;
    And Michael rose ere he could get a word
      Of all his foundered verses under way,
    And cried, "For God's sake stop, my friend! 'twere best--
    'Non Di, non homines'--you know the rest."

                        XCII.

    A general bustle spread throughout the throng,
      Which seemed to hold all verse in detestation;
    The Angels had of course enough of song
      When upon service; and the generation
    Of ghosts had heard too much in life, not long
      Before, to profit by a new occasion:
    The Monarch, mute till then, exclaimed, "What! what!
    Pye come again? No more--no more of that!"

                        XCIII.

    The tumult grew; an universal cough
      Convulsed the skies, as during a debate,
    When Castlereagh has been up long enough
      (Before he was first minister of state,
    I mean--the slaves hear now); some cried "Off, off!"
      As at a farce; till, grown quite desperate,
    The Bard Saint Peter prayed to interpose
    (Himself an author) only for his prose.

                        XCIV.

    The varlet was not an ill-favoured knave;
      A good deal like a vulture in the face,
    With a hook nose and a hawk's eye, which gave
      A smart and sharper-looking sort of grace
    To his whole aspect, which, though rather grave,
      Was by no means so ugly as his case;
    But that, indeed, was hopeless as can be,
    Quite a poetic felony "de se."

                        XCV.

    Then Michael blew his trump, and stilled the noise
      With one still greater, as is yet the mode
    On earth besides; except some grumbling voice,
      Which now and then will make a slight inroad
    Upon decorous silence, few will twice
      Lift up their lungs when fairly overcrowed;
    And now the Bard could plead his own bad cause,
    With all the attitudes of self-applause.

                        XCVI.

    He said--(I only give the heads)--he said,
      He meant no harm in scribbling; 'twas his way
    Upon all topics; 'twas, besides, his bread,
      Of which he buttered both sides; 'twould delay
    Too long the assembly (he was pleased to dread),
      And take up rather more time than a day,
    To name his works--he would but cite a few--
    "Wat Tyler"--"Rhymes on Blenheim"--"Waterloo."

                        XCVII.

    He had written praises of a Regicide;
      He had written praises of all kings whatever;
    He had written for republics far and wide,
      And then against them bitterer than ever;
    For pantisocracy he once had cried
      Aloud, a scheme less moral than 'twas clever;
    Then grew a hearty anti-jacobin--
    Had turned his coat--and would have turned his skin.

                        XCVIII.

    He had sung against all battles, and again
      In their high praise and glory; he had called
    Reviewing "the ungentle craft," and then
      Became as base a critic as e'er crawled--
    Fed, paid, and pampered by the very men
      By whom his muse and morals had been mauled:
    He had written much blank verse, and blanker prose,
    And more of both than any body knows.

                        XCIX.

    He had written Wesley's life:--here turning round
      To Satan, "Sir, I'm ready to write yours,
    In two octavo volumes, nicely bound,
      With notes and preface, all that most allures
    The pious purchaser; and there's no ground
      For fear, for I can choose my own reviewers:
    So let me have the proper documents,
    That I may add you to my other saints."

                        C.

    Satan bowed, and was silent. "Well, if you,
      With amiable modesty, decline
    My offer, what says Michael? There are few
      Whose memoirs could be rendered more divine.
    Mine is a pen of all work; not so new
      As it was once, but I would make you shine
    Like your own trumpet. By the way, my own
    Has more of brass in it, and is as well blown.

                        CI.

    "But talking about trumpets, here's my 'Vision!'
      Now you shall judge, all people--yes--you shall
    Judge with my judgment! and by my decision
      Be guided who shall enter heaven or fall.
    I settle all these things by intuition,
      Times present, past, to come--Heaven--Hell--and all,
    Like King Alfonso. When I thus see double,
    I save the Deity some worlds of trouble."

                        CII.

    He ceased, and drew forth an MS.; and no
      Persuasion on the part of Devils, Saints,
    Or Angels, now could stop the torrent; so
      He read the first three lines of the contents:
    But at the fourth, the whole spiritual show
    Had vanished, with variety of scents,
    Ambrosial and sulphureous, as they sprang,
    Like lightning, off from his "melodious twang."

                        CIII.

    Those grand heroics acted as a spell;
      The Angels stopped their ears and plied their pinions;
    The Devils ran howling, deafened, down to Hell;
      The ghosts fled, gibbering, for their own dominions--
    (For 'tis not yet decided where they dwell,
      And I leave every man to his opinions);
    Michael took refuge in his trump--but, lo!
    His teeth were set on edge, he could not blow!

                        CIV.

    Saint Peter, who has hitherto been known
      For an impetuous saint, upraised his keys,
    And at the fifth line knocked the poet down;
      Who fell like Phaeton, but more at ease,
    Into his lake, for there he did not drown;
      A different web being by the Destinies
    Woven for the Laureate's final wreath, whene'er
    Reform shall happen either here or there.

                        CV.

    He first sank to the bottom--like his works,
      But soon rose to the surface--like himself;
    For all corrupted things are buoyed like corks,
      By their own rottenness, light as an elf,
    Or wisp that flits o'er a morass: he lurks,
      It may be, still, like dull books on a shelf,
    In his own den, to scrawl some "Life" or "Vision,"
    As Welborn says--"the Devil turned precisian."

                        CVI.

    As for the rest, to come to the conclusion
      Of this true dream, the telescope is gone
    Which kept my optics free from all delusion,
      And showed me what I in my turn have shown;
    All I saw farther, in the last confusion,
      Was, that King George slipped into Heaven for one;
    And when the tumult dwindled to a calm,
    I left him practising the hundredth psalm.
                                                      
  A VERY MOURNFUL BALLAD ON THE SIEGE AND CONQUEST OF ALHAMA.

Which, in the Arabic language, is to the following purport

                        1.

    The Moorish King rides up and down.
    Through Granada's royal town:
    From Elvira's gates to those
    Of Bivarambla on he goes.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        2.

    Letters to the Monarch tell
    How Alhama's city fell:
    In the fire the scroll he threw,
    And the messenger he slew.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        3.

    He quits his mule, and mounts his horse,
    And through the street directs his course;
    Through the street of Zacatin
    To the Alhambra spurring in.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        4.

    When the Alhambra walls he gained,
    On the moment he ordained
    That the trumpet straight should sound
    With the silver clarion round.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        5.

    And when the hollow drums of war
    Beat the loud alarm afar,
    That the Moors of town and plain
    Might answer to the martial strain.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        6.

    Then the Moors, by this aware,
    That bloody Mars recalled them there,
    One by one, and two by two,
    To a mighty squadron grew.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        7.

    Out then spake an aged Moor
    In these words the king before,
    "Wherefore call on us, oh King?
    What may mean this gathering?"
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        8.

    "Friends! ye have, alas! to know
    Of a most disastrous blow--
    That the Christians, stern and bold,
    Have obtained Alhama's hold."
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        9.

    Out then spake old Alfaqui,
    With his beard so white to see,
    "Good King! thou art justly served,
    Good King! this thou hast deserved.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        10.

    "By thee were slain, in evil hour,
    The Abencerrage, Granada's flower;
    And strangers were received by thee,
    Of Cordova the Chivalry.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        11.

    "And for this, oh King! is sent
    On thee a double chastisement;
    Thee and thine, thy crown and realm,
    One last wreck shall overwhelm.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        12.

    "He who holds no laws in awe,
    He must perish by the law;
    And Granada must be won,
    And thyself with her undone."
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        13.

    Fire flashed from out the old Moor's eyes,
    The Monarch's wrath began to rise,
    Because he answered, and because
    He spake exceeding well of laws.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        14.

    "There is no law to say such things
    As may disgust the ear of kings:"--
    Thus, snorting with his choler, said
    The Moorish King, and doomed him dead.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        15.

    Moor Alfaqui! Moor Alfaqui!
    Though thy beard so hoary be,
    The King hath sent to have thee seized,
    For Alhama's loss displeased.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        16.

    And to fix thy head upon
    High Alhambra's loftiest stone;
    That this for thee should be the law,
    And others tremble when they saw.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        17.

    "Cavalier, and man of worth!
    Let these words of mine go forth;
    Let the Moorish Monarch know,
    That to him I nothing owe.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        18.

    "But on my soul Alhama weighs,
    And on my inmost spirit preys;
    And if the King his land hath lost,
    Yet others may have lost the most.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        19.

    "Sires have lost their children, wives
    Their lords, and valiant men their lives!
    One what best his love might claim
    Hath lost, another wealth, or fame.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        20.

    "I lost a damsel in that hour,
    Of all the land the loveliest flower;
    Doubloons a hundred I would pay,
    And think her ransom cheap that day."
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        21.

    And as these things the old Moor said,
    They severed from the trunk his head;
    And to the Alhambra's wall with speed
    'Twas carried, as the King decreed.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        22.

    And men and infants therein weep
    Their loss, so heavy and so deep;
    Granada's ladies, all she rears
    Within her walls, burst into tears.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        23.

    And from the windows o'er the walls
    The sable web of mourning falls;
    The King weeps as a woman o'er
    His loss, for it is much and sore.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!
                   
                       TRANSLATION FROM VITTORELLI.

                                ON A NUN.

     Sonnet composed in the name of a father, whose daughter had
     recently died shortly after her marriage; and addressed to the
     father of her who had lately taken the veil.

    Of two fair virgins, modest, though admired,
        Heaven made us happy; and now, wretched sires,
        Heaven for a nobler doom their worth desires,
        And gazing upon either, both required.

    Mine, while the torch of Hymen newly fired
        Becomes extinguished,--soon--too soon expires;
        But thine, within the closing grate retired,
        Eternal captive, to her God aspires.

    But thou at least from out the jealous door,
        Which shuts between your never-meeting eyes,
        May'st hear her sweet and pious voice once more:

    I to the marble, where my daughter lies,
        Rush,--the swoln flood of bitterness I pour,
        And knock, and knock, and knock--but none replies.
                
                   ON THE BUST OF HELEN BY CANOVA.

    In this beloved marble view
      Above the works and thoughts of Man,
    What Nature could but would not do,
      And Beauty and Canova can!
    Beyond Imagination's power,
      Beyond the Bard's defeated art,
    With Immortality her dower,
      Behold the Helen of the heart.
                                                     
                         VENICE. A FRAGMENT.

    'Tis midnight--but it is not dark
    Within thy spacious place, St. Mark!
    The Lights within, the Lamps without,
    Shine above the revel rout.
    The brazen Steeds are glittering o'er
    The holy building's massy door,
    Glittering with their collars of gold,
    The goodly work of the days of old--
    And the winged Lion stern and solemn
    Frowns from the height of his hoary column,
    Facing the palace in which doth lodge
    The ocean-city's dreaded Doge.
    The palace is proud--but near it lies,
    Divided by the "Bridge of Sighs,"
    The dreary dwelling where the State
    Enchains the captives of their hate:
    These--they perish or they pine;
    But which their doom may none divine:
    Many have passed that Arch of pain,
    But none retraced their steps again.

    It is a princely colonnade!
    And wrought around a princely place,
    When that vast edifice displayed
    Looks with its venerable face
    Over the far and subject sea,
    Which makes the fearless isles so free!
    And 'tis a strange and noble pile,
    Pillared into many an aisle:
    Every pillar fair to see,
    Marble--jasper--and porphyry--
    The Church of St. Mark--which stands hard by
    With fretted pinnacles on high,
    And Cupola and minaret;
    More like the mosque of orient lands,
    Than the fanes wherein we pray,
    And Mary's blessed likeness stands.--
                                            
                    SO WE'LL GO NO MORE A-ROVING.

                        1.

    So we'll go no more a-roving
      So late into the night,
    Though the heart be still as loving,
      And the moon be still as bright.

                        2.

    For the sword outwears its sheath,
      And the soul wears out the breast,
    And the heart must pause to breathe,
      And Love itself have rest.

                        3.

    Though the night was made for loving,
      And the day returns too soon,
    Yet we'll go no more a-roving
      By the light of the moon.
                                                                         
                                QUESTION.

    Nose and Chin that make a knocker,
    Wrinkles that would puzzle Cocker;
    Mouth that marks the envious Scorner,
    With a Scorpion in each corner
    Curling up his tail to sting you,
    In the place that most may wring you;
    Eyes of lead-like hue and gummy,
    Carcase stolen from some mummy,
    Bowels--(but they were forgotten,
    Save the Liver, and that's rotten),
    Skin all sallow, flesh all sodden,
    Form the Devil would frighten G--d in.
    Is't a Corpse stuck up for show,
    Galvanized at times to go?
    With the Scripture has't connection,
    New proof of the Resurrection?
    Vampire, Ghost, or Goul (sic), what is it?
    I would walk ten miles to miss it.

                                 ANSWER.

    Many passengers arrest one,
    To demand the same free question.
    Shorter's my reply and franker,--
    That's the Bard, and Beau, and Banker:
    Yet, if you could bring about
    Just to turn him inside out,
    Satan's self would seem less sooty,
    And his present aspect--Beauty.
    Mark that (as he masks the bilious)
    Air so softly supercilious,
    Chastened bow, and mock humility,
    Almost sickened to Servility:
    Hear his tone (which is to talking
    That which creeping is to walking--
    Now on all fours, now on tiptoe):
    Hear the tales he lends his lip to--
    Little hints of heavy scandals--
    Every friend by turns he handles:
    All that women or that men do
    Glides forth in an inuendo (sic)--
    Clothed in odds and ends of humour,
    Herald of each paltry rumour--
    From divorces down to dresses,
    Woman's frailties, Man's excesses:
    All that life presents of evil
    Make for him a constant revel.
    You're his foe--for that he fears you,
    And in absence blasts and sears you:
    You're his friend--for that he hates you,
    First obliges, and then baits you,
    Darting on the opportunity
    When to do it with impunity:
    You are neither--then he'll flatter,
    Till he finds some trait for satire;
    Hunts your weak point out, then shows it,
    Where it injures, to expose it
    In the mode that's most insidious,
    Adding every trait that's hideous--
    From the bile, whose blackening river
    Rushes through his Stygian liver.

    Then he thinks himself a lover--
    Why? I really can't discover,
    In his mind, age, face, or figure;
    Viper broth might give him vigour:
    Let him keep the cauldron steady,
    He the venom has already.

    For his faults--he has but one;
    'Tis but Envy, when all's done:
    He but pays the pain he suffers,
    Clipping, like a pair of Snuffers,
    Light that ought to burn the brighter
    For this temporary blighter.
    He's the Cancer of his Species,
    And will eat himself to pieces,--
    Plague personified and Famine,--
    Devil, whose delight is damning.
    For his merits--don't you know 'em?
    Once he wrote a pretty Poem.
                                                                 
                              THE DUEL.

                        1.

    'Tis fifty years, and yet their fray
    To us might seem but yesterday.
    Tis fifty years, and three to boot,
    Since, hand to hand, and foot to foot,
    And heart to heart, and sword to sword,
    One of our Ancestors was gored.
    I've seen the sword that slew him; he,
    The slain, stood in a like degree
    To thee, as he, the Slayer, stood
    (Oh had it been but other blood!)
    In kin and Chieftainship to me.
    Thus came the Heritage to thee.

                        2.

    To me the Lands of him who slew
      Came through a line of yore renowned;
    For I can boast a race as true
      To Monarchs crowned, and some discrowned,
    As ever Britain's Annals knew:
    For the first Conqueror gave us Ground,
      And the last Conquered owned the line
      Which was my mother's, and is mine.

                        3.

    I loved thee--I will not say how,
    Since things like these are best forgot:
    Perhaps thou may'st imagine now
      Who loved thee, and who loved thee not.
    And thou wert wedded to another,
      And I at last another wedded:
    I am a father, thou a mother,
      To Strangers vowed, with strangers bedded.
    For land to land, even blood to blood--
      Since leagued of yore our fathers were--
    Our manors and our birthright stood;
    And not unequal had I wooed,
      If to have wooed thee I could dare.
    But this I never dared--even yet
    When naught is left but to forget.
      I feel that I could only love:
    To sue was never meant for me,
    And least of all to sue to thee;
    For many a bar, and many a feud,
    Though never told, well understood
      Rolled like a river wide between--
    And then there was the Curse of blood,
      Which even my Heart's can not remove.
      Alas! how many things have been!
    Since we were friends; for I alone
    Feel more for thee than can be shown.

                        4.

    How many things! I loved thee--thou
      Loved'st me not: another was
    The Idol of thy virgin vow,
      And I was, what I am, Alas!
    And what he is, and what thou art,
      And what we were, is like the rest:
      We must endure it as a test,
    And old Ordeal of the Heart.
                                              
                         STANZAS TO THE PO.

                        1.

    River, that rollest by the ancient walls,
      Where dwells the Lady of my love, when she
    Walks by thy brink, and there perchance recalls
      A faint and fleeting memory of me:

                        2.

    What if thy deep and ample stream should be
      A mirror of my heart, where she may read
    The thousand thoughts I now betray to thee,
      Wild as thy wave, and headlong as thy speed!

                        3.

    What do I say--a mirror of my heart?
      Are not thy waters sweeping, dark, and strong?
    Such as my feelings were and are, thou art;
      And such as thou art were my passions long.

                        4.

    Time may have somewhat tamed them,--not for ever;
      Thou overflow'st thy banks, and not for aye
    Thy bosom overboils, congenial river!
      Thy floods subside, and mine have sunk away:

                        5.

    But left long wrecks behind, and now again,
      Borne in our old unchanged career, we move:
    Thou tendest wildly onwards to the main,
      And I--to loving one I should not love.

                        6.

    The current I behold will sweep beneath
      Her native walls, and murmur at her feet;
    Her eyes will look on thee, when she shall breathe
      The twilight air, unharmed by summer's heat.

                        7.

    She will look on thee,--I have looked on thee,
      Full of that thought: and, from that moment, ne'er
    Thy waters could I dream of, name, or see,
      Without the inseparable sigh for her!

                        8.

    Her bright eyes will be imaged in thy stream,--
      Yes! they will meet the wave I gaze on now:
    Mine cannot witness, even in a dream,
      That happy wave repass me in its flow!

                        9.

    The wave that bears my tears returns no more:
      Will she return by whom that wave shall sweep?--
    Both tread thy banks, both wander on thy shore,
      I by thy source, she by the dark-blue deep.

                        10.

    But that which keepeth us apart is not
      Distance, nor depth of wave, nor space of earth,
    But the distraction of a various lot,
      As various as the climates of our birth.

                        11.

    A stranger loves the Lady of the land,
      Born far beyond the mountains, but his blood
    Is all meridian, as if never fanned
      By the black wind that chills the polar flood.

                        12.

    My blood is all meridian; were it not,
      I had not left my clime, nor should I be,
    In spite of tortures, ne'er to be forgot,
      A slave again of love,--at least of thee.

                        13.

    'Tis vain to struggle--let me perish young--
      Live as I lived, and love as I have loved;
    To dust if I return, from dust I sprung,
      And then, at least, my heart can ne'er be moved.
                                                               
          SONNET ON THE NUPTIALS OF THE MARQUIS ANTONIO CAVALLI
            WITH THE COUNTESS CLELIA RASPONI OF RAVENNA.

    A noble Lady of the Italian shore
      Lovely and young, herself a happy bride,
      Commands a verse, and will not be denied,
    From me a wandering Englishman; I tore
    One sonnet, but invoke the muse once more
      To hail these gentle hearts which Love has tied,
      In Youth, Birth, Beauty, genially allied
    And blest with Virtue's soul, and Fortune's store.
    A sweeter language, and a luckier bard
      Were worthier of your hopes, Auspicious Pair!
    And of the sanctity of Hymen's shrine,
      But,--since I cannot but obey the Fair,
    To render your new state your true reward,
      May your Fate be like Hers, and unlike mine.
                                                  
                     SONNET TO THE PRINCE REGENT.
          ON THE REPEAL OF LORD EDWARD FITZGERALD'S FORFEITURE.

    To be the father of the fatherless,
      To stretch the hand from the throne's height, and raise
      His offspring, who expired in other days
    To make thy Sire's sway by a kingdom less,--
    This is to be a monarch, and repress
      Envy into unutterable praise.
      Dismiss thy guard, and trust thee to such traits,
    For who would lift a hand, except to bless?
      Were it not easy, Sir, and is't not sweet
      To make thyself beloved? and to be
    Omnipotent by Mercy's means? for thus
      Thy Sovereignty would grow but more complete,
    A despot thou, and yet thy people free,
      And by the heart--not hand--enslaving us.
                                         
                              STANZAS.

                        1.

        Could Love for ever
        Run like a river,
        And Time's endeavour
          Be tried in vain--
        No other pleasure
        With this could measure;
        And like a treasure
          We'd hug the chain.
        But since our sighing
        Ends not in dying,
        And, formed for flying,
          Love plumes his wing;
        Then for this reason
        Let's love a season;
    But let that season be only Spring.

                        2.

        When lovers parted
        Feel broken-hearted,
        And, all hopes thwarted,
          Expect to die;
        A few years older,
        Ah! how much colder
        They might behold her
          For whom they sigh!
        When linked together,
        In every weather,
        They pluck Love's feather
          From out his wing--
        He'll stay for ever,
        But sadly shiver
    Without his plumage, when past the Spring.

                        3.

        Like Chiefs of Faction,
        His life is action--
        A formal paction
          That curbs his reign,
        Obscures his glory,
        Despot no more, he
        Such territory
          Quits with disdain.
        Still, still advancing,
        With banners glancing,
        His power enhancing,
          He must move on--
        Repose but cloys him,
        Retreat destroys him,
    Love brooks not a degraded throne.

                        4.

        Wait not, fond lover!
        Till years are over,
        And then recover
          As from a dream.
        While each bewailing
        The other's failing.
        With wrath and railing,
          All hideous seem--
        While first decreasing,
        Yet not quite ceasing,
        Wait not till teasing,
          All passion blight:
        If once diminished
        Love's reign is finished--
    Then part in friendship,--and bid good-night.

                        5.

        So shall Affection
        To recollection
        The dear connection
          Bring back with joy:
        You had not waited
        Till, tired or hated,
        Your passions sated
          Began to cloy.
        Your last embraces
        Leave no cold traces--
        The same fond faces
          As through the past:
        And eyes, the mirrors
        Of your sweet errors,
    Reflect but rapture--not least though last.

                        6.

        True, separations
        Ask more than patience;
        What desperations
          From such have risen!
        But yet remaining,
        What is't but chaining
        Hearts which, once waning,
          Beat 'gainst their prison?
        Time can but cloy love,
        And use destroy love:
        The winged boy, Love,
          Is but for boys--
        You'll find it torture
        Though sharper, shorter,
    To wean, and not wear out your joys.
                                                      
             ODE TO A LADY WHOSE LOVER WAS KILLED BY A BALL,
        WHICH AT THE SAME TIME SHIVERED A PORTRAIT NEXT HIS HEART.

Motto.

     On peut trouver des femmes qui n'ont jamais eu de galanterie, mais
     il est rare d'en trouver qui n'en aient jamais eu
     qu'une.--

                        1.

      Lady! in whose heroic port
    And Beauty, Victor even of Time,
      And haughty lineaments, appear
      Much that is awful, more that's dear--
      Wherever human hearts resort
      There must have been for thee a Court,
      And Thou by acclamation Queen,
      Where never Sovereign yet had been.
    That eye so soft, and yet severe,
      Perchance might look on Love as Crime;
    And yet--regarding thee more near--
    The traces of an unshed tear
      Compressed back to the heart,
    And mellowed Sadness in thine air,
    Which shows that Love hath once been there,
    To those who watch thee will disclose
    More than ten thousand tomes of woes
      Wrung from the vain Romancer's art.
    With thee how proudly Love hath dwelt!
    His full Divinity was felt,
    Maddening the heart he could not melt,
      Till Guilt became Sublime;
    But never yet did Beauty's Zone
    For him surround a lovelier throne,
    Than in that bosom once his own:
      And he the Sun and Thou the Clime
    Together must have made a Heaven
    For which the Future would be given.

                        2.

    And thou hast loved--Oh! not in vain!
      And not as common Mortals love.
        The Fruit of Fire is Ashes,
        The Ocean's tempest dashes
    Wrecks and the dead upon the rocky shore:
    True Passion must the all-searching changes prove,
      The Agony of Pleasure and of Pain,
      Till Nothing but the Bitterness remain;
      And the Heart's Spectre flitting through the brain
    Scoffs at the Exorcism which would remove.

                        3.

    And where is He thou lovedst? in the tomb,
      Where should the happy Lover be!
    For him could Time unfold a brighter doom,
      Or offer aught like thee?
    He in the thickest battle died,
      Where Death is Pride;
    And Thou his widow--not his bride,
      Wer't not more free--
    Here where all love, till Love is made
      A bondage or a trade,
    Here--thou so redolent of Beauty,
    In whom Caprice had seemed a duty,
    Thou, who could'st trample and despise
    The holiest chain of human ties
    For him, the dear One in thine eyes,
      Broke it no more.
    Thy heart was withered to it's Core,
    It's hopes, it's fears, it's feelings o'er:
    Thy Blood grew Ice when his was shed,
    And Thou the Vestal of the Dead.

                        4.

    Thy Lover died, as All
      Who truly love should die;
    For such are worthy in the fight to fall
      Triumphantly.
    No Cuirass o'er that glowing heart
    The deadly bullet turned apart:
    Love had bestowed a richer Mail,
      Like Thetis on her Son;
    But hers at last was vain, and thine could fail--
      The hero's and the lover's race was run.
    Thy worshipped portrait, thy sweet face,
    Without that bosom kept it's place
      As Thou within.
    Oh! enviously destined Ball!
    Shivering thine imaged charms and all
      Those Charms would win:
    Together pierced, the fatal Stroke hath gored
    Votary and Shrine, the adoring and the adored.
      That Heart's last throb was thine, that blood
      Baptized thine Image in it's flood,
      And gushing from the fount of Faith
      O'erflowed with Passion even in Death,
    Constant to thee as in it's hour
    Of rapture in the secret bower.
    Thou too hast kept thy plight full well,
    As many a baffled Heart can tell.
    
                        THE IRISH AVATAR.

"And Ireland, like a bastinadoed elephant, kneeling to receive the
paltry rider."--

                        1.

    Ere the daughter of Brunswick is cold in her grave,
    And her ashes still float to their home o'er the tide,
    Lo! George the triumphant speeds over the wave,
      To the long-cherished Isle which he loved like his--bride.

                        2.

    True, the great of her bright and brief Era are gone,
      The rain-bow-like Epoch where Freedom could pause
    For the few little years, out of centuries won,
      Which betrayed not, or crushed not, or wept not her cause.

                        3.

    True, the chains of the Catholic clank o'er his rags,
      The Castle still stands, and the Senate's no more,
    And the Famine which dwelt on her freedomless crags
      Is extending its steps to her desolate shore.

                        4.

    To her desolate shore--where the emigrant stands
      For a moment to gaze ere he flies from his hearth;
    Tears fall on his chain, though it drops from his hands,
      For the dungeon he quits is the place of his birth.

                        5.

    But he comes! the Messiah of Royalty comes!
      Like a goodly Leviathan rolled from the waves;
    Then receive him as best such an advent becomes,
      With a legion of cooks, and an army of slaves!

                        6.

    He comes in the promise and bloom of threescore,
      To perform in the pageant the Sovereign's part--
    But long live the Shamrock, which shadows him o'er!
      Could the Green in his hat be transferred to his heart!

                        7.

    Could that long-withered spot but be verdant again,
      And a new spring of noble affections arise--
    Then might Freedom forgive thee this dance in thy chain,
      And this shout of thy slavery which saddens the skies.

                        8.

    Is it madness or meanness which clings to thee now?
      Were he God--as he is but the commonest clay,
    With scarce fewer wrinkles than sins on his brow--
      Such servile devotion might shame him away.

                        9.

    Aye, roar in his train! let thine orators lash
      Their fanciful spirits to pamper his pride--
    Not thus did thy Grattan indignantly flash
      His soul o'er the freedom implored and denied.

                        10.

    Ever glorious Grattan! the best of the good!
      So simple in heart, so sublime in the rest!
    With all which Demosthenes wanted endued,
      And his rival, or victor, in all he possessed.

                        11.

    Ere Tully arose in the zenith of Rome,
      Though unequalled, preceded, the task was begun--
    But Grattan sprung up like a god from the tomb
      Of ages, the first, last, the saviour, the one!

                        12.

    With the skill of an Orpheus to soften the brute;
      With the fire of Prometheus to kindle mankind;
    Even Tyranny, listening, sate melted or mute,
      And Corruption shrunk scorched from the glance of his mind.

                        13.

    But back to our theme! Back to despots and slaves!
      Feasts furnished by Famine! rejoicings by Pain!
    True Freedom but welcomes, while Slavery still raves,
      When a week's Saturnalia hath loosened her chain.

                        14.

    Let the poor squalid splendour thy wreck can afford,
      (As the bankrupt's profusion his ruin would hide)
    Gild over the palace, Lo! Erin, thy Lord!
      Kiss his foot with thy blessing--his blessings denied!

                        15.

    Or if freedom past hope be extorted at last,
      If the idol of brass find his feet are of clay,
    Must what terror or policy wring forth be classed
      With what monarchs ne'er give, but as wolves yield their prey?

                        16.

    Each brute hath its nature; a King's is to reign,--
      To reign! in that word see, ye ages, comprised
    The cause of the curses all annals contain,
      From Caesar the dreaded to George the despised!

                        17.

    Wear, Fingal, thy trapping! O'Connell, proclaim
      His accomplishments! His!!! and thy country convince
    Half an age's contempt was an error of fame,
      And that "Hal is the rascaliest, sweetest young prince!"

                        18.

    Will thy yard of blue riband, poor Fingal, recall
      The fetters from millions of Catholic limbs?
    Or, has it not bound thee the fastest of all
      The slaves, who now hail their betrayer with hymns?

                        19.

    Aye! "Build him a dwelling!" let each give his mite!
      Till, like Babel, the new royal dome hath arisen!
    Let thy beggars and helots their pittance unite--
      And a palace bestow for a poor-house and prison!

                        20.

    Spread--spread for Vitellius, the royal repast,
      Till the gluttonous despot be stuffed to the gorge!
    And the roar of his drunkards proclaim him at last
      The Fourth of the fools and oppressors called "George!"

                        21.

    Let the tables be loaded with feasts till they groan!
      Till they groan like thy people, through ages of woe!
    Let the wine flow around the old Bacchanal's throne,
      Like their blood which has flowed, and which yet has to flow.

                        22.

    But let not his name be thine idol alone--
      On his right hand behold a Sejanus appears!
    Thine own Castlereagh! let him still be thine own!
      A wretch never named but with curses and jeers!

                        23.

    Till now, when the Isle which should blush for his birth,
      Deep, deep as the gore which he shed on her soil,
    Seems proud of the reptile which crawled from her earth,
      And for murder repays him with shouts and a smile.

                        24.

    Without one single ray of her genius,--without
      The fancy, the manhood, the fire of her race--
    The miscreant who well might plunge Erin in doubt
      If she ever gave birth to a being so base.

                        25.

    If she did--let her long-boasted proverb be hushed,
      Which proclaims that from Erin no reptile can spring--
    See the cold-blooded Serpent, with venom full flushed,
      Still warming its folds in the breast of a King!

                        26.

    Shout, drink, feast, and flatter! Oh! Erin, how low
      Wert thou sunk by misfortune and tyranny, till
    Thy welcome of tyrants hath plunged thee below
      The depth of thy deep in a deeper gulf still.

                        27.

    My voice, though but humble, was raised for thy right;
      My vote, as a freeman's, still voted thee free;
    This hand, though but feeble, would arm in thy fight,
      And this heart, though outworn, had a throb still for thee!

                        28.

    Yes, I loved thee and thine, though thou art not my land;
      I have known noble hearts and great souls in thy sons,
    And I wept with the world, o'er the patriot band
      Who are gone, but I weep them no longer as once.

                        29.

    For happy are they now reposing afar,--
      Thy Grattan, thy Curran, thy Sheridan, all
    Who, for years, were the chiefs in the eloquent war,
      And redeemed, if they have not retarded, thy fall.

                        30.

    Yes, happy are they in their cold English graves!
      Their shades cannot start to thy shouts of to-day--
    Nor the steps of enslavers and chain-kissing slaves
      Be stamped in the turf o'er their fetterless clay.

                        31.

    Till now I had envied thy sons and their shore,
      Though their virtues were hunted, their liberties fled;
    There was something so warm and sublime in the core
      Of an Irishman's heart, that I envy--thy dead.

                        32.

    Or, if aught in my bosom can quench for an hour
      My contempt for a nation so servile, though sore,
    Which though trod like the worm will not turn upon power,
      'Tis the glory of Grattan, and genius of Moore!

    Oh, talk not to me of a name great in story--
    The days of our Youth are the days of our glory;
    And the myrtle and ivy of sweet two-and-twenty
    Are worth all your laurels, though ever so plenty.

                        2.

    What are garlands and crowns to the brow that is wrinkled?
    Tis but as a dead flower with May-dew besprinkled:
    Then away with all such from the head that is hoary,
    What care I for the wreaths that can only give glory?

                        3.

    Oh Fame!--if I e'er took delight in thy praises,
    'Twas less for the sake of thy high-sounding phrases,
    Than to see the bright eyes of the dear One discover,
    She thought that I was not unworthy to love her.

                        4.

    There chiefly I sought thee, there only I found thee;
    Her Glance was the best of the rays that surround thee,
    When it sparkled o'er aught that was bright in my story,
    I knew it was Love, and I felt it was Glory.

      Oh! my lonely--lonely--lonely--Pillow!
    Where is my lover? where is my lover?
    Is it his bark which my dreary dreams discover?
      Far--far away! and alone along the billow?

                        2.

      Oh! my lonely--lonely--lonely--Pillow!
    Why must my head ache where his gentle brow lay?
    How the long night flags lovelessly and slowly,
      And my head droops over thee like the willow!

                        3.

      Oh! thou, my sad and solitary Pillow!
    Send me kind dreams to keep my heart from breaking,
    In return for the tears I shed upon thee waking;
      Let me not die till he comes back o'er the billow.

                        4.

      Then if thou wilt--no more my lonely Pillow,
    In one embrace let these arms again enfold him,
    And then expire of the joy--but to behold him!
      Oh! my lone bosom!--oh! my lonely Pillow!
          
                               TO----

                        1.

    But once I dared to lift my eyes--
      To lift my eyes to thee;
    And since that day, beneath the skies,
      No other sight they see.

                        2.

    In vain sleep shuts them in the night--
      The night grows day to me;
    Presenting idly to my sight
      What still a dream must be.

                        3.

    A fatal dream--for many a bar
      Divides thy fate from mine;
    And still my passions wake and war,
      But peace be still with thine.
         
                     TO THE COUNTESS OF BLESSINGTON.

                        1.

    You have asked for a verse:--the request
      In a rhymer 'twere strange to deny;
    But my Hippocrene was but my breast,
      And my feelings (its fountain) are dry.

                        2.

    Were I now as I was, I had sung
      What Lawrence has painted so well;
    But the strain would expire on my tongue,
      And the theme is too soft for my shell.

                        3.

    I am ashes where once I was fire,
      And the bard in my bosom is dead;
    What I loved I now merely admire,
      And my heart is as grey as my head.

                        4.

    My Life is not dated by years--
      There are moments which act as a plough,
    And there is not a furrow appears
      But is deep in my soul as my brow.

                        5.

    Let the young and the brilliant aspire
      To sing what I gaze on in vain;
    For Sorrow has torn from my lyre
      The string which was worthy the strain.

                               Canto First.

                        1.

    The Gods of old are silent on the shore.
    Since the great Pan expired, and through the roar
    Of the Ionian waters broke a dread
    Voice which proclaimed "the Mighty Pan is dead."
    How much died with him! false or true--the dream
    Was beautiful which peopled every stream
    With more than finny tenants, and adorned
    The woods and waters with coy nymphs that scorned
    Pursuing Deities, or in the embrace
    Of gods brought forth the high heroic race
    Whose names are on the hills and o'er the seas.
                                       
                             THE BLUES:

O trust not, ye beautiful creatures, to hue,
Though your hair were as red, as your stockings are blue.

                    I.

    The "good old times"--all times when old are good--
    Are gone; the present might be if they would;
    Great things have been, and are, and greater still
    Want little of mere mortals but their will:
    A wider space, a greener field, is given
    To those who play their "tricks before high heaven."
    I know not if the angels weep, but men
    Have wept enough--for what?--to weep again!

                    II.

    All is exploded--be it good or bad.
    Reader! remember when thou wert a lad,
    Then Pitt was all; or, if not all, so much,
    His very rival almost deemed him such.
    We--we have seen the intellectual race
    Of giants stand, like Titans, face to face--
    Athos and Ida, with a dashing sea
    Of eloquence between, which flowed all free,
    As the deep billows of the Aegean roar
    Betwixt the Hellenic and the Phrygian shore.
    But where are they--the rivals! a few feet
    Of sullen earth divide each winding sheet.
    How peaceful and how powerful is the grave,
    Which hushes all! a calm, unstormy wave,
    Which oversweeps the World. The theme is old
    Of "Dust to Dust," but half its tale untold:
    Time tempers not its terrors--still the worm
    Winds its cold folds, the tomb preserves its form,
    Varied above, but still alike below;
    The urn may shine--the ashes will not glow--
    Though Cleopatra's mummy cross the sea
    O'er which from empire she lured Anthony;
    Though Alexander's urn a show be grown
    On shores he wept to conquer, though unknown--
    How vain, how worse than vain, at length appear
    The madman's wish, the Macedonian's tear!
    He wept for worlds to conquer--half the earth
    Knows not his name, or but his death, and birth,
    And desolation; while his native Greece
    Hath all of desolation, save its peace.
    He "wept for worlds to conquer!" he who ne'er
    Conceived the Globe, he panted not to spare!
    With even the busy Northern Isle unknown,
    Which holds his urn--and never knew his throne.

                    III.

    But where is he, the modern, mightier far,
    Who, born no king, made monarchs draw his car;
    The new Sesostris, whose unharnessed kings,
    Freed from the bit, believe themselves with wings,
    And spurn the dust o'er which they crawled of late,
    Chained to the chariot of the Chieftain's state?
    Yes! where is he, "the champion and the child"
    Of all that's great or little--wise or wild;
    Whose game was Empire, and whose stakes were thrones;
    Whose table Earth--whose dice were human bones?
    Behold the grand result in yon lone Isle,
    And, as thy nature urges--weep or smile.
    Sigh to behold the Eagle's lofty rage
    Reduced to nibble at his narrow cage;
    Smile to survey the queller of the nations
    Now daily squabbling o'er disputed rations;
    Weep to perceive him mourning, as he dines,
    O'er curtailed dishes and o'er stinted wines;
    O'er petty quarrels upon petty things.
    Is this the Man who scourged or feasted kings?
    Behold the scales in which his fortune hangs,
    A surgeon's statement, and an earl's harangues!
    A bust delayed,--a book refused, can shake
    The sleep of Him who kept the world awake.
    Is this indeed the tamer of the Great,
    Now slave of all could tease or irritate--
    The paltry gaoler and the prying spy,
    The staring stranger with his note-book nigh?
    Plunged in a dungeon, he had still been great;
    How low, how little was this middle state,
    Between a prison and a palace, where
    How few could feel for what he had to bear!
    Vain his complaint,--My Lord presents his bill,
    His food and wine were doled out duly still;
    Vain was his sickness, never was a clime
    So free from homicide--to doubt's crime;
    And the stiff surgeon, who maintained his cause,
    Hath lost his place, and gained the world's applause.
    But smile--though all the pangs of brain and heart
    Disdain, defy, the tardy aid of art;
    Though, save the few fond friends and imaged face
    Of that fair boy his Sire shall ne'er embrace,
    None stand by his low bed--though even the mind
    Be wavering, which long awed and awes mankind:
    Smile--for the fettered Eagle breaks his chain,
    And higher Worlds than this are his again.

                    IV.

    How, if that soaring Spirit still retain
    A conscious twilight of his blazing reign,
    How must he smile, on looking down, to see
    The little that he was and sought to be!
    What though his Name a wider empire found
    Than his Ambition, though with scarce a bound;
    Though first in glory, deepest in reverse,
    He tasted Empire's blessings and its curse;
    Though kings, rejoicing in their late escape
    From chains, would gladly be their Tyrant's ape;
    How must he smile, and turn to yon lone grave,
    The proudest Sea-mark that o'ertops the wave!
    What though his gaoler, duteous to the last,
    Scarce deemed the coffin's lead could keep him fast,
    Refusing one poor line along the lid,
    To date the birth and death of all it hid;
    That name shall hallow the ignoble shore,
    A talisman to all save him who bore:
    The fleets that sweep before the eastern blast
    Shall hear their sea-boys hail it from the mast;
    When Victory's Gallic column shall but rise,
    Like Pompey's pillar, in a desert's skies,
    The rocky Isle that holds or held his dust,
    Shall crown the Atlantic like the Hero's bust,
    And mighty Nature o'er his obsequies
    Do more than niggard Envy still denies.
    But what are these to him? Can Glory's lust
    Touch the freed spirit or the fettered dust?
    Small care hath he of what his tomb consists;
    Nought if he sleeps--nor more if he exists:
    Alike the better-seeing Shade will smile
    On the rude cavern of the rocky isle,
    As if his ashes found their latest home
    In Rome's Pantheon or Gaul's mimic dome.
    He wants not this; but France shall feel the want
    Of this last consolation, though so scant:
    Her Honour--Fame--and Faith demand his bones,
    To rear above a Pyramid of thrones;
    Or carried onward in the battle's van,
    To form, like Guesclin's dust, her Talisman.
    But be it as it is--the time may come
    His name shall beat the alarm, like Ziska's drum.

                    V.

    Oh Heaven! of which he was in power a feature;
    Oh Earth! of which he was a noble creature;
    Thou Isle! to be remembered long and well,
    That saw'st the unfledged eaglet chip his shell!
    Ye Alps which viewed him in his dawning flights
    Hover, the Victor of a hundred fights!
    Thou Rome, who saw'st thy Caesar's deeds outdone!
    Alas! why passed he too the Rubicon--
    The Rubicon of Man's awakened rights,
    To herd with vulgar kings and parasites?
    Egypt! from whose all dateless tombs arose
    Forgotten Pharaohs from their long repose,
    And shook within their pyramids to hear
    A new Cambyses thundering in their ear;
    While the dark shades of Forty Ages stood
    Like startled giants by Nile's famous flood;
    Or from the Pyramid's tall pinnacle
    Beheld the desert peopled, as from hell,
    With clashing hosts, who strewed the barren sand,
    To re-manure the uncultivated land!
    Spain! which, a moment mindless of the Cid,
    Beheld his banner flouting thy Madrid!
    Austria! which saw thy twice-ta'en capital
    Twice spared to be the traitress of his fall!
    Ye race of Frederic!--Frederics but in name
    And falsehood--heirs to all except his fame:
    Who, crushed at Jena, crouched at Berlin, fell
    First, and but rose to follow! Ye who dwell
    Where Kosciusko dwelt, remembering yet
    The unpaid amount of Catherine's bloody debt!
    Poland! o'er which the avenging Angel past,
    But left thee as he found thee, still a waste,
    Forgetting all thy still enduring claim,
    Thy lotted people and extinguished name,
    Thy sigh for freedom, thy long-flowing tear,
    That sound that crashes in the tyrant's ear--
    Kosciusko! On--on--on--the thirst of War
    Gasps for the gore of serfs and of their Czar.
    The half barbaric Moscow's minarets
    Gleam in the sun, but 'tis a sun that sets!
    Moscow! thou limit of his long career,
    For which rude Charles had wept his frozen tear
    To see in vain--he saw thee--how? with spire
    And palace fuel to one common fire.
    To this the soldier lent his kindling match,
    To this the peasant gave his cottage thatch,
    To this the merchant flung his hoarded store,
    The prince his hall--and Moscow was no more!
    Sublimest of volcanoes! Etna's flame
    Pales before thine, and quenchless Hecla's tame;
    Vesuvius shows his blaze, an usual sight
    For gaping tourists, from his hackneyed height:
    Thou stand'st alone unrivalled, till the Fire
    To come, in which all empires shall expire!

      Thou other Element! as strong and stern,
    To teach a lesson conquerors will not learn!--
    Whose icy wing flapped o'er the faltering foe,
    Till fell a hero with each flake of snow;
    How did thy numbing beak and silent fang,
    Pierce, till hosts perished with a single pang!
    In vain shall Seine look up along his banks
    For the gay thousands of his dashing ranks!
    In vain shall France recall beneath her vines
    Her Youth--their blood flows faster than her wines;
    Or stagnant in their human ice remains
    In frozen mummies on the Polar plains.
    In vain will Italy's broad sun awaken
    Her offspring chilled; its beams are now forsaken.
    Of all the trophies gathered from the war,
    What shall return? the Conqueror's broken car!
    The Conqueror's yet unbroken heart! Again
    The horn of Roland sounds, and not in vain.
    Lutzen, where fell the Swede of victory,
    Beholds him conquer, but, alas! not die:
    Dresden surveys three despots fly once more
    Before their sovereign,--sovereign as before;
    But there exhausted Fortune quits the field,
    And Leipsic's treason bids the unvanquished yield;
    The Saxon jackal leaves the lion's side
    To turn the bear's, and wolf's, and fox's guide;
    And backward to the den of his despair
    The forest monarch shrinks, but finds no lair!

      Oh ye! and each, and all! Oh France! who found
    Thy long fair fields ploughed up as hostile ground,
    Disputed foot by foot, till Treason, still
    His only victor, from Montmartre's hill
    Looked down o'er trampled Paris! and thou Isle,
    Which seest Etruria from thy ramparts smile,
    Thou momentary shelter of his pride,
    Till wooed by danger, his yet weeping bride!
    Oh, France! retaken by a single march,
    Whose path was through one long triumphal arch!
    Oh bloody and most bootless Waterloo!
    Which proves how fools may have their fortune too,
    Won half by blunder, half by treachery:
    Oh dull Saint Helen! with thy gaoler nigh--
    Hear! hear Prometheus from his rock appeal
    To Earth,--Air,--Ocean,--all that felt or feel
    His power and glory, all who yet shall hear
    A name eternal as the rolling year;
    He teaches them the lesson taught so long,
    So oft, so vainly--learn to do no wrong!
    A single step into the right had made
    This man the Washington of worlds betrayed:
    A single step into the wrong has given
    His name a doubt to all the winds of heaven;
    The reed of Fortune, and of thrones the rod,
    Of Fame the Moloch or the demigod;
    His country's Caesar, Europe's Hannibal,
    Without their decent dignity of fall.
    Yet Vanity herself had better taught
    A surer path even to the fame he sought,
    By pointing out on History's fruitless page
    Ten thousand conquerors for a single sage.
    While Franklin's quiet memory climbs to Heaven,
    Calming the lightning which he thence hath riven,
    Or drawing from the no less kindled earth
    Freedom and peace to that which boasts his birth;
    While Washington's a watchword, such as ne'er
    Shall sink while there's an echo left to air:
    While even the Spaniard's thirst of gold and war
    Forgets Pizarro to shout Bolivar!
    Alas! why must the same Atlantic wave
    Which wafted freedom gird a tyrant's grave--
    The king of kings, and yet of slaves the slave,
    Who burst the chains of millions to renew
    The very fetters which his arm broke through,
    And crushed the rights of Europe and his own,
    To flit between a dungeon and a throne?

                    VI.

    But 'twill not be--the spark's awakened--lo!
    The swarthy Spaniard feels his former glow;
    The same high spirit which beat back the Moor
    Through eight long ages of alternate gore
    Revives--and where? in that avenging clime
    Where Spain was once synonymous with crime,
    Where Cortes' and Pizarro's banner flew,
    The infant world redeems her name of "New."
    'Tis the old aspiration breathed afresh,
    To kindle souls within degraded flesh,
    Such as repulsed the Persian from the shore
    Where Greece was--No! she still is Greece once more.
    One common cause makes myriads of one breast,
    Slaves of the East, or helots of the West:
    On Andes' and on Athos' peaks unfurled,
    The self-same standard streams o'er either world:
    The Athenian wears again Harmodius' sword;
    The Chili chief abjures his foreign lord;
    The Spartan knows himself once more a Greek,
    Young Freedom plumes the crest of each cacique;
    Debating despots, hemmed on either shore,
    Shrink vainly from the roused Atlantic's roar;
    Through Calpe's strait the rolling tides advance,
    Sweep slightly by the half-tamed land of France,
    Dash o'er the old Spaniard's cradle, and would fain
    Unite Ausonia to the mighty main:
    But driven from thence awhile, yet not for aye,
    Break o'er th' Aegean, mindful of the day
    Of Salamis!--there, there the waves arise,
    Not to be lulled by tyrant victories.
    Lone, lost, abandoned in their utmost need
    By Christians, unto whom they gave their creed,
    The desolated lands, the ravaged isle,
    The fostered feud encouraged to beguile,
    The aid evaded, and the cold delay,
    Prolonged but in the hope to make a prey;--
    These, these shall tell the tale, and Greece can show
    The false friend worse than the infuriate foe.
    But this is well: Greeks only should free Greece,
    Not the barbarian, with his masque of peace.
    How should the Autocrat of bondage be
    The king of serfs, and set the nations free?
    Better still serve the haughty Mussulman,
    Than swell the Cossaque's prowling caravan;
    Better still toil for masters, than await,
    The slave of slaves, before a Russian gate,--
    Numbered by hordes, a human capital,
    A live estate, existing but for thrall,
    Lotted by thousands, as a meet reward
    For the first courtier in the Czar's regard;
    While their immediate owner never tastes
    His sleep, sans dreaming of Siberia's wastes:
    Better succumb even to their own despair,
    And drive the Camel--than purvey the Bear.

                    VII.

    But not alone within the hoariest clime
    Where Freedom dates her birth with that of Time,
    And not alone where, plunged in night, a crowd
    Of Incas darken to a dubious cloud,
    The dawn revives: renowned, romantic Spain
    Holds back the invader from her soil again.
    Not now the Roman tribe nor Punic horde
    Demands her fields as lists to prove the sword;
    Not now the Vandal or the Visigoth
    Pollute the plains, alike abhorring both;
    Nor old Pelayo on his mountain rears
    The warlike fathers of a thousand years.
    That seed is sown and reaped, as oft the Moor
    Sighs to remember on his dusky shore.
    Long in the peasant's song or poet's page
    Has dwelt the memory of Abencerrage;
    The Zegri, and the captive victors, flung
    Back to the barbarous realm from whence they sprung.
    But these are gone--their faith, their swords, their sway,
    Yet left more anti-christian foes than they;
    The bigot monarch, and the butcher priest,
    The Inquisition, with her burning feast,
    The Faith's red "Auto," fed with human fuel,
    While sate the catholic Moloch, calmly cruel,
    Enjoying, with inexorable eye,
    That fiery festival of Agony!
    The stern or feeble sovereign, one or both
    By turns; the haughtiness whose pride was sloth;
    The long degenerate noble; the debased
    Hidalgo, and the peasant less disgraced,
    But more degraded; the unpeopled realm;
    The once proud navy which forgot the helm;
    The once impervious phalanx disarrayed;
    The idle forge that formed Toledo's blade;
    The foreign wealth that flowed on every shore,
    Save hers who earned it with the native's gore;
    The very language which might vie with Rome's,
    And once was known to nations like their homes,
    Neglected or forgotten:--such was Spain;
    But such she is not, nor shall be again.
    These worst, these home invaders, felt and feel
    The new Numantine soul of old Castile,
    Up! up again! undaunted Tauridor!
    The bull of Phalaris renews his roar;
    Mount, chivalrous Hidalgo! not in vain
    Revive the cry--"Iago! and close Spain!"
    Yes, close her with your armed bosoms round,
    And form the barrier which Napoleon found,--
    The exterminating war, the desert plain,
    The streets without a tenant, save the slain;
    The wild Sierra, with its wilder troop
    Of vulture-plumed Guerrillas, on the stoop
    For their incessant prey; the desperate wall
    Of Saragossa, mightiest in her fall;
    The Man nerved to a spirit, and the Maid
    Waving her more than Amazonian blade;
    The knife of Arragon, Toledo's steel;
    The famous lance of chivalrous Castile;
    The unerring rifle of the Catalan;
    The Andalusian courser in the van;
    The torch to make a Moscow of Madrid;
    And in each heart the spirit of the Cid:--
    Such have been, such shall be, such are. Advance,
    And win--not Spain! but thine own freedom, France!

                    VIII.

    But lo! a Congress! What! that hallowed name
    Which freed the Atlantic! May we hope the same
    For outworn Europe? With the sound arise,
    Like Samuel's shade to Saul's monarchic eyes,
    The prophets of young Freedom, summoned far
    From climes of Washington and Bolivar;
    Henry, the forest-born Demosthenes,
    Whose thunder shook the Philip of the seas;
    And stoic Franklin's energetic shade,
    Robed in the lightnings which his hand allayed;
    And Washington, the tyrant-tamer, wake,
    To bid us blush for these old chains, or break.
    But who compose this Senate of the few
    That should redeem the many? Who renew
    This consecrated name, till now assigned
    To councils held to benefit mankind?
    Who now assemble at the holy call?
    The blest Alliance, which says three are all!
    An earthly Trinity! which wears the shape
    Of Heaven's, as man is mimicked by the ape.
    A pious Unity! in purpose one--
    To melt three fools to a Napoleon.
    Why, Egypt's Gods were rational to these;
    Their dogs and oxen knew their own degrees,
    And, quiet in their kennel or their shed,
    Cared little, so that they were duly fed;
    But these, more hungry, must have something more--
    The power to bark and bite, to toss and gore.
    Ah, how much happier were good Aesop's frogs
    Than we! for ours are animated logs,
    With ponderous malice swaying to and fro,
    And crushing nations with a stupid blow;
    All dully anxious to leave little work
    Unto the revolutionary stork.

                    IX.

    Thrice blest Verona! since the holy three
    With their imperial presence shine on thee!
    Honoured by them, thy treacherous site forgets
    The vaunted tomb of "all the Capulets!"
    Thy Scaligers--for what was "Dog the Great,"
    "Can Grande," (which I venture to translate,)
    To these sublimer pugs? Thy poet too,
    Catullus, whose old laurels yield to new;
    Thine amphitheatre, where Romans sate;
    And Dante's exile sheltered by thy gate;
    Thy good old man, whose world was all within
    Thy wall, nor knew the country held him in;
    Would that the royal guests it girds about
    Were so far like, as never to get out!
    Aye, shout! inscribe! rear monuments of shame,
    To tell Oppression that the world is tame!
    Crowd to the theatre with loyal rage,
    The comedy is not upon the stage;
    The show is rich in ribandry and stars,
    Then gaze upon it through thy dungeon bars;
    Clap thy permitted palms, kind Italy,
    For thus much still thy fettered hands are free!

                    X.

    Resplendent sight! Behold the coxcomb Czar,
    The Autocrat of waltzes and of war!
    As eager for a plaudit as a realm,
    And just as fit for flirting as the helm;
    A Calmuck beauty with a Cossack wit,
    And generous spirit, when 'tis not frost-bit;
    Now half dissolving to a liberal thaw,
    But hardened back whene'er the morning's raw;
    With no objection to true Liberty,
    Except that it would make the nations free.
    How well the imperial dandy prates of peace!
    How fain, if Greeks would be his slaves, free Greece!
    How nobly gave he back the Poles their Diet,
    Then told pugnacious Poland to be quiet!
    How kindly would he send the mild Ukraine,
    With all her pleasant Pulks, to lecture Spain!
    How royally show off in proud Madrid
    His goodly person, from the South long hid!
    A blessing cheaply purchased, the world knows,
    By having Muscovites for friends or foes.
    Proceed, thou namesake of great Philip's son!
    La Harpe, thine Aristotle, beckons on;
    And that which Scythia was to him of yore
    Find with thy Scythians on Iberia's shore.
    Yet think upon, thou somewhat aged youth,
    Thy predecessor on the banks of Pruth;
    Thou hast to aid thee, should his lot be thine,
    Many an old woman, but not Catherine.
    Spain, too, hath rocks, and rivers, and defiles--
    The Bear may rush into the Lion's toils.
    Fatal to Goths are Xeres' sunny fields;
    Think'st thou to thee Napoleon's victor yields?
    Better reclaim thy deserts, turn thy swords
    To ploughshares, shave and wash thy Bashkir hordes,
    Redeem thy realms from slavery and the knout,
    Than follow headlong in the fatal route,
    To infest the clime whose skies and laws are pure
    With thy foul legions. Spain wants no manure:
    Her soil is fertile, but she feeds no foe:
    Her vultures, too, were gorged not long ago;
    And wouldst thou furnish them with fresher prey?
    Alas! thou wilt not conquer, but purvey.
    I am Diogenes, though Russ and Hun
    Stand between mine and many a myriad's sun;
    But were I not Diogenes, I'd wander
    Rather a worm than such an Alexander!
    Be slaves who will, the cynic shall be free;
    His tub hath tougher walls than Sinope:
    Still will he hold his lantern up to scan
    The face of monarchs for an "honest man."

                    XI.

    And what doth Gaul, the all-prolific land
    Of ne plus ultra ultras and their band
    Of mercenaries? and her noisy chambers
    And tribune, which each orator first clambers
    Before he finds a voice, and when 'tis found,
    Hears "the lie" echo for his answer round?
    Our British Commons sometimes deign to "hear!"
    A Gallic senate hath more tongue than ear;
    Even Constant, their sole master of debate,
    Must fight next day his speech to vindicate.
    But this costs little to true Franks, who'd rather
    Combat than listen, were it to their father.
    What is the simple standing of a shot,
    To listening long, and interrupting not?
    Though this was not the method of old Rome,
    When Tully fulmined o'er each vocal dome,
    Demosthenes has sanctioned the transaction,
    In saying eloquence meant "Action, action!"

                    XII.

    But where's the monarch? hath he dined? or yet
    Groans beneath indigestion's heavy debt?
    Have revolutionary pates risen,
    And turned the royal entrails to a prison?
    Have discontented movements stirred the troops?
    Or have no movements followed traitorous soups?
    Have Carbonaro cooks not carbonadoed
    Each course enough? or doctors dire dissuaded
    Repletion? Ah! in thy dejected looks
    I read all France's treason in her cooks!
    Good classic Louis! is it, canst thou say,
    Desirable to be the "Desire?"
    Why wouldst thou leave calm Hartwell's green abode,
    Apician table, and Horatian ode,
    To rule a people who will not be ruled,
    And love much rather to be scourged than schooled?
    Ah! thine was not the temper or the taste
    For thrones; the table sees thee better placed:
    A mild Epicurean, formed, at best,
    To be a kind host and as good a guest,
    To talk of Letters, and to know by heart
    One half the Poet's, all the Gourmand's art;
    A scholar always, now and then a wit,
    And gentle when Digestion may permit;--
    But not to govern lands enslaved or free;
    The gout was martyrdom enough for thee.

                    XIII.

    Shall noble Albion pass without a phrase
    From a bold Briton in her wonted praise?
    "Arts--arms--and George--and glory--and the Isles,
    And happy Britain, wealth, and Freedom's smiles,
    White cliffs, that held invasion far aloof,
    Contented subjects, all alike tax-proof,
    Proud Wellington, with eagle beak so curled,
    That nose, the hook where he suspends the world!
    And Waterloo, and trade, and----(hush! not yet
    A syllable of imposts or of debt)----
    And ne'er (enough) lamented Castlereagh,
    Whose penknife slit a goose-quill t'other day--
    And, 'pilots who have weathered every storm'--
    (But, no, not even for rhyme's sake, name Reform)."
    These are the themes thus sung so oft before,
    Methinks we need not sing them any more;
    Found in so many volumes far and near,
    There's no occasion you should find them here.
    Yet something may remain perchance to chime
    With reason, and, what's stranger still, with rhyme.
    Even this thy genius, Canning! may permit,
    Who, bred a statesman, still wast born a wit,
    And never, even in that dull House, couldst tame
    To unleavened prose thine own poetic flame;
    Our last, our best, our only orator,
    Even I can praise thee--Tories do no more:
    Nay, not so much;--they hate thee, man, because
    Thy Spirit less upholds them than it awes.
    The hounds will gather to their huntsman's hollo,
    And where he leads the duteous pack will follow;
    But not for love mistake their yelling cry;
    Their yelp for game is not an eulogy;
    Less faithful far than the four-footed pack,
    A dubious scent would lure the bipeds back.
    Thy saddle-girths are not yet quite secure,
    Nor royal stallion's feet extremely sure;
    The unwieldy old white horse is apt at last
    To stumble, kick--and now and then stick fast
    With his great Self and Rider in the mud;
    But what of that? the animal shows blood.

                    XIV.

    Alas, the Country! how shall tongue or pen
    Bewail her now uncountry gentlemen?
    The last to bid the cry of warfare cease,
    The first to make a malady of peace.
    For what were all these country patriots born?
    To hunt--and vote--and raise the price of corn?
    But corn, like every mortal thing, must fall,
    Kings--Conquerors--and markets most of all.
    And must ye fall with every ear of grain?
    Why would you trouble Buonaparte's reign?
    He was your great Triptolemus; his vices
    Destroyed but realms, and still maintained your prices;
    He amplified to every lord's content
    The grand agrarian alchymy, high rent.
    Why did the tyrant stumble on the Tartars,
    And lower wheat to such desponding quarters?
    Why did you chain him on yon Isle so lone?
    The man was worth much more upon his throne.
    True, blood and treasure boundlessly were spilt,
    But what of that? the Gaul may bear the guilt;
    But bread was high, the farmer paid his way,
    And acres told upon the appointed day.
    But where is now the goodly audit ale?
    The purse-proud tenant, never known to fail?
    The farm which never yet was left on hand?
    The marsh reclaimed to most improving land?
    The impatient hope of the expiring lease?
    The doubling rental? What an evil's peace!
    In vain the prize excites the ploughman's skill,
    In vain the Commons pass their patriot bill;
    The Landed Interest--(you may understand
    The phrase much better leaving out the land)--
    The land self-interest groans from shore to shore,
    For fear that plenty should attain the poor.
    Up, up again, ye rents, exalt your notes,
    Or else the Ministry will lose their votes,
    And patriotism, so delicately nice,
    Her loaves will lower to the market price;
    For ah! "the loaves and fishes," once so high,
    Are gone--their oven closed, their ocean dry,
    And nought remains of all the millions spent,
    Excepting to grow moderate and content.
    They who are not so, had their turn--and turn
    About still flows from Fortune's equal urn;
    Now let their virtue be its own reward,
    And share the blessings which themselves prepared.
    See these inglorious Cincinnati swarm,
    Farmers of war, dictators of the farm;
    Their ploughshare was the sword in hireling hands,
    Their fields manured by gore of other lands;
    Safe in their barns, these Sabine tillers sent
    Their brethren out to battle--why? for rent!
    Year after year they voted cent. per cent.
    Blood, sweat, and tear-wrung millions--why?--for rent!
    They roared, they dined, they drank, they swore they meant
    To die for England--why then live?--for rent!
    The peace has made one general malcontent
    Of these high-market patriots; war was rent!
    Their love of country, millions all mis-spent,
    How reconcile? by reconciling rent!
    And will they not repay the treasures lent?
    No: down with everything, and up with rent!
    Their good, ill, health, wealth, joy, or discontent,
    Being, end, aim, religion--rent--rent--rent!
    Thou sold'st thy birthright, Esau! for a mess;
    Thou shouldst have gotten more, or eaten less;
    Now thou hast swilled thy pottage, thy demands
    Are idle; Israel says the bargain stands.
    Such, landlords! was your appetite for war,
    And gorged with blood, you grumble at a scar!
    What! would they spread their earthquake even o'er cash?
    And when land crumbles, bid firm paper crash?
    So rent may rise, bid Bank and Nation fall,
    And found on 'Change a Fundling Hospital?
    Lo, Mother Church, while all religion writhes,
    Like Niobe, weeps o'er her offspring--Tithes;
    The Prelates go to--where the Saints have gone,
    And proud pluralities subside to one;
    Church, state, and faction wrestle in the dark,
    Tossed by the deluge in their common ark.
    Shorn of her bishops, banks, and dividends,
    Another Babel soars--but Britain ends.
    And why? to pamper the self-seeking wants,
    And prop the hill of these agrarian ants.
    "Go to these ants, thou sluggard, and be wise;"
    Admire their patience through each sacrifice,
    Till taught to feel the lesson of their pride,
    The price of taxes and of homicide;
    Admire their justice, which would fain deny
    The debt of nations:--pray who made it high?

                    XV.

    Or turn to sail between those shifting rocks,
    The new Symplegades--the crushing Stocks,
    Where Midas might again his wish behold
    In real paper or imagined gold.
    That magic palace of Alcina shows
    More wealth than Britain ever had to lose,
    Were all her atoms of unleavened ore,
    And all her pebbles from Pactolus' shore.
    There Fortune plays, while Rumour holds the stake
    And the World trembles to bid brokers break.
    How rich is Britain! not indeed in mines,
    Or peace or plenty, corn or oil, or wines;
    No land of Canaan, full of milk and honey,
    Nor (save in paper shekels) ready money:
    But let us not to own the truth refuse,
    Was ever Christian land so rich in Jews?
    Those parted with their teeth to good King John,
    And now, ye kings, they kindly draw your own;
    All states, all things, all sovereigns they control,
    And waft a loan "from Indus to the pole."
    The banker--broker--baron--brethren, speed
    To aid these bankrupt tyrants in their need.
    Nor these alone; Columbia feels no less
    Fresh speculations follow each success;
    And philanthropic Israel deigns to drain
    Her mild per-centage from exhausted Spain.
    Not without Abraham's seed can Russia march;
    Tis gold, not steel, that rears the conqueror's arch.
    Two Jews, a chosen people, can command
    In every realm their Scripture-promised land:--
    Two Jews, keep down the Romans, and uphold
    The accursed Hun, more brutal than of old:
    Two Jews,--but not Samaritans--direct
    The world, with all the spirit of their sect.
    What is the happiness of earth to them?
    A congress forms their "New Jerusalem,"
    Where baronies and orders both invite--
    Oh, holy Abraham! dost thou see the sight?
    Thy followers mingling with these royal swine,
    Who spit not "on their Jewish gaberdine,"
    But honour them as portion of the show--
    (Where now, oh Pope! is thy forsaken toe?
    Could it not favour Judah with some kicks?
    Or has it ceased to "kick against the pricks?")
    On Shylock's shore behold them stand afresh,
    To cut from Nation's hearts their "pound of flesh."

                    XVI.

    Strange sight this Congress! destined to unite
    All that's incongruous, all that's opposite.
    I speak not of the Sovereigns--they're alike,
    A common coin as ever mint could strike;
    But those who sway the puppets, pull the strings,
    Have more of motley than their heavy kings.
    Jews, authors, generals, charlatans, combine,
    While Europe wonders at the vast design:
    There Metternich, power's foremost parasite,
    Cajoles; there Wellington forgets to fight;
    There Chateaubriand forms new books of martyrs;
    And subtle Greeks intrigue for stupid Tartars;
    There Montmorenci, the sworn foe to charters,
    Turns a diplomatist of great eclat,
    To furnish articles for the "Debats;"
    Of war so certain--yet not quite so sure
    As his dismissal in the "Moniteur."
    Alas! how could his cabinet thus err!
    Can Peace be worth an ultra-minister?
    He falls indeed, perhaps to rise again,
    "Almost as quickly as he conquered Spain."

                    XVII.

    Enough of this--a sight more mournful woos
    The averted eye of the reluctant Muse.
    The Imperial daughter, the Imperial bride,
    The imperial Victim--sacrifice to pride;
    The mother of the Hero's hope, the boy,
    The young Astyanax of Modern Troy;
    The still pale shadow of the loftiest Queen
    That Earth has yet to see, or e'er hath seen;
    She flits amidst the phantoms of the hour,
    The theme of pity, and the wreck of power.
    Oh, cruel mockery! Could not Austria spare
    A daughter? What did France's widow there?
    Her fitter place was by St. Helen's wave,
    Her only throne is in Napoleon's grave.
    But, no,--she still must hold a petty reign,
    Flanked by her formidable chamberlain;
    The martial Argus, whose not hundred eyes
    Must watch her through these paltry pageantries.
    What though she share no more, and shared in vain,
    A sway surpassing that of Charlemagne,
    Which swept from Moscow to the southern seas!
    Yet still she rules the pastoral realm of cheese,
    Where Parma views the traveller resort,
    To note the trappings of her mimic court.
    But she appears! Verona sees her shorn
    Of all her beams--while nations gaze and mourn--
    Ere yet her husband's ashes have had time
    To chill in their inhospitable clime;
    (If e'er those awful ashes can grow cold;--
    But no,--their embers soon will burst the mould;)
    She comes!--the Andromache (but not Racine's,
    Nor Homer's,)--Lo! on Pyrrhus' arm she leans!
    Yes! the right arm, yet red from Waterloo,
    Which cut her lord's half-shattered sceptre through,
    Is offered and accepted? Could a slave
    Do more? or less?--and he in his new grave!
    Her eye--her cheek--betray no inward strife,
    And the Ex-Empress grows as Ex a wife!
    So much for human ties in royal breasts!
    Why spare men's feelings, when their own are jests?

                    XVIII.

    But, tired of foreign follies, I turn home,
    And sketch the group--the picture's yet to come.
    My Muse 'gan weep, but, ere a tear was spilt,
    She caught Sir William Curtis in a kilt!
    While thronged the chiefs of every Highland clan
    To hail their brother, Vich Ian Alderman!
    Guildhall grows Gael, and echoes with Erse roar,
    While all the Common Council cry "Claymore!"
    To see proud Albyn's tartans as a belt
    Gird the gross sirloin of a city Celt,
    She burst into a laughter so extreme,
    That I awoke--and lo! it was no dream!

    Here, reader, will we pause:--if there's no harm in
    This first--you'll have, perhaps, a second "Carmen."
                    
                                THE ISLAND

                                    OR,

                          CHRISTIAN AND HIS COMRADES.

                             CANTO THE FIRST.

                    I.

    The morning watch was come; the vessel lay
    Her course, and gently made her liquid way;
    The cloven billow flashed from off her prow
    In furrows formed by that majestic plough;
    The waters with their world were all before;
    Behind, the South Sea's many an islet shore.
    The quiet night, now dappling, 'gan to wane,
    Dividing darkness from the dawning main;
    The dolphins, not unconscious of the day,
    Swam high, as eager of the coming ray;
    The stars from broader beams began to creep,
    And lift their shining eyelids from the deep;
    The sail resumed its lately shadowed white,
    And the wind fluttered with a freshening flight;
    The purpling Ocean owns the coming Sun,
    But ere he break--a deed is to be done.

                    II.

    The gallant Chief within his cabin slept,
    Secure in those by whom the watch was kept:
    His dreams were of Old England's welcome shore,
    Of toils rewarded, and of dangers o'er;
    His name was added to the glorious roll
    Of those who search the storm-surrounded Pole.
    The worst was over, and the rest seemed sure,
    And why should not his slumber be secure?
    Alas! his deck was trod by unwilling feet,
    And wilder hands would hold the vessel's sheet;
    Young hearts, which languished for some sunny isle,
    Where summer years and summer women smile;
    Men without country, who, too long estranged,
    Had found no native home, or found it changed,
    And, half uncivilised, preferred the cave
    Of some soft savage to the uncertain wave--
    The gushing fruits that nature gave unfilled;
    The wood without a path--but where they willed;
    The field o'er which promiscuous Plenty poured
    Her horn; the equal land without a lord;
    The wish--which ages have not yet subdued
    In man--to have no master save his mood;
    The earth, whose mine was on its face, unsold,
    The glowing sun and produce all its gold;
    The Freedom which can call each grot a home;
    The general garden, where all steps may roam,
    Where Nature owns a nation as her child,
    Exulting in the enjoyment of the wild;
    Their shells, their fruits, the only wealth they know,
    Their unexploring navy, the canoe;
    Their sport, the dashing breakers and the chase;
    Their strangest sight, an European face:--
    Such was the country which these strangers yearned
    To see again--a sight they dearly earned.

                    III.

    Awake, bold Bligh! the foe is at the gate!
    Awake! awake!----Alas! it is too late!
    Fiercely beside thy cot the mutineer
    Stands, and proclaims the reign of rage and fear.
    Thy limbs are bound, the bayonet at thy breast;
    The hands, which trembled at thy voice, arrest;
    Dragged o'er the deck, no more at thy command
    The obedient helm shall veer, the sail expand;
    That savage Spirit, which would lull by wrath
    Its desperate escape from Duty's path,
    Glares round thee, in the scarce believing eyes
    Of those who fear the Chief they sacrifice:
    For ne'er can Man his conscience all assuage,
    Unless he drain the wine of Passion--Rage.

                    IV.

    In vain, not silenced by the eye of Death,
    Thou call'st the loyal with thy menaced breath:--
    They come not; they are few, and, overawed,
    Must acquiesce, while sterner hearts applaud.
    In vain thou dost demand the cause: a curse
    Is all the answer, with the threat of worse.
    Full in thine eyes is waved the glittering blade,
    Close to thy throat the pointed bayonet laid.
    The levelled muskets circle round thy breast
    In hands as steeled to do the deadly rest.
    Thou dar'st them to their worst, exclaiming--"Fire!"
    But they who pitied not could yet admire;
    Some lurking remnant of their former awe
    Restrained them longer than their broken law;
    They would not dip their souls at once in blood,
    But left thee to the mercies of the flood.

                    V.

    "Hoist out the boat!" was now the leader's cry;
    And who dare answer "No!" to Mutiny,
    In the first dawning of the drunken hour,
    The Saturnalia of unhoped-for power?
    The boat is lowered with all the haste of hate,
    With its slight plank between thee and thy fate;
    Her only cargo such a scant supply
    As promises the death their hands deny;
    And just enough of water and of bread
    To keep, some days, the dying from the dead:
    Some cordage, canvass, sails, and lines, and twine,
    But treasures all to hermits of the brine,
    Were added after, to the earnest prayer
    Of those who saw no hope, save sea and air;
    And last, that trembling vassal of the Pole--
    The feeling compass--Navigation's soul.

                    VI.

    And now the self-elected Chief finds time
    To stun the first sensation of his crime,
    And raise it in his followers--"Ho! the bowl!"
    Lest passion should return to reason's shoal.
    "Brandy for heroes!" Burke could once exclaim--
    No doubt a liquid path to Epic fame;
    And such the new-born heroes found it here,
    And drained the draught with an applauding cheer.
    "Huzza! for Otaheite!" was the cry.
    How strange such shouts from sons of Mutiny!
    The gentle island, and the genial soil,
    The friendly hearts, the feasts without a toil,
    The courteous manners but from nature caught,
    The wealth unhoarded, and the love unbought;
    Could these have charms for rudest sea-boys, driven
    Before the mast by every wind of heaven?
    And now, even now prepared with others' woes
    To earn mild Virtue's vain desire, repose?
    Alas! such is our nature! all but aim
    At the same end by pathways not the same;
    Our means--our birth--our nation, and our name,
    Our fortune--temper--even our outward frame,
    Are far more potent o'er our yielding clay
    Than aught we know beyond our little day.
    Yet still there whispers the small voice within,
    Heard through Gain's silence, and o'er Glory's din:
    Whatever creed be taught, or land be trod,
    Man's conscience is the Oracle of God.

                    VII.

    The launch is crowded with the faithful few
    Who wait their Chief, a melancholy crew:
    But some remained reluctant on the deck
    Of that proud vessel--now a moral wreck--
    And viewed their Captain's fate with piteous eyes;
    While others scoffed his augured miseries,
    Sneered at the prospect of his pigmy sail,
    And the slight bark so laden and so frail.
    The tender nautilus, who steers his prow,
    The sea-born sailor of his shell canoe,
    The ocean Mab, the fairy of the sea,
    Seems far less fragile, and, alas! more free.
    He, when the lightning-winged Tornados sweep
    The surge, is safe--his port is in the deep--
    And triumphs o'er the armadas of Mankind,
    Which shake the World, yet crumble in the wind.

                    VIII.

    When all was now prepared, the vessel clear
    Which hailed her master in the mutineer,
    A seaman, less obdurate than his mates,
    Showed the vain pity which but irritates;
    Watched his late Chieftain with exploring eye,
    And told, in signs, repentant sympathy;
    Held the moist shaddock to his parched mouth,
    Which felt Exhaustion's deep and bitter drouth.
    But soon observed, this guardian was withdrawn,
    Nor further Mercy clouds Rebellion's dawn.
    Then forward stepped the bold and froward boy
    His Chief had cherished only to destroy,
    And, pointing to the helpless prow beneath,
    Exclaimed, "Depart at once! delay is death!"
    Yet then, even then, his feelings ceased not all:
    In that last moment could a word recall
    Remorse for the black deed as yet half done,
    And what he hid from many showed to one:
    When Bligh in stern reproach demanded where
    Was now his grateful sense of former care?
    Where all his hopes to see his name aspire,
    And blazon Britain's thousand glories higher?
    His feverish lips thus broke their gloomy spell,
    "Tis that! 'tis that! I am in hell! in hell!"
    No more he said; but urging to the bark
    His Chief, commits him to his fragile ark;
    These the sole accents from his tongue that fell,
    But volumes lurked below his fierce farewell.

                    IX.

    The arctic Sun rose broad above the wave;
    The breeze now sank, now whispered from his cave;
    As on the Aeolian harp, his fitful wings
    Now swelled, now fluttered o'er his Ocean strings.
    With slow, despairing oar, the abandoned skiff
    Ploughs its drear progress to the scarce seen cliff,
    Which lifts its peak a cloud above the main:
    That boat and ship shall never meet again!

    But 'tis not mine to tell their tale of grief,
    Their constant peril, and their scant relief;
    Their days of danger, and their nights of pain;
    Their manly courage even when deemed in vain;
    The sapping famine, rendering scarce a son
    Known to his mother in the skeleton;
    The ills that lessened still their little store,
    And starved even Hunger till he wrung no more;
    The varying frowns and favours of the deep,
    That now almost ingulfs, then leaves to creep
    With crazy oar and shattered strength along
    The tide that yields reluctant to the strong;
    The incessant fever of that arid thirst
    Which welcomes, as a well, the clouds that burst
    Above their naked bones, and feels delight
    In the cold drenching of the stormy night,
    And from the outspread canvass gladly wrings
    A drop to moisten Life's all-gasping springs;
    The savage foe escaped, to seek again
    More hospitable shelter from the main;
    The ghastly Spectres which were doomed at last
    To tell as true a tale of dangers past,
    As ever the dark annals of the deep
    Disclosed for man to dread or woman weep.

                    X.

    We leave them to their fate, but not unknown
    Nor unredressed. Revenge may have her own:
    Roused Discipline aloud proclaims their cause,
    And injured Navies urge their broken laws.
    Pursue we on his track the mutineer,
    Whom distant vengeance had not taught to fear.
    Wide o'er the wave--away! away! away!
    Once more his eyes shall hail the welcome bay;
    Once more the happy shores without a law
    Receive the outlaws whom they lately saw;
    Nature, and Nature's goddess--Woman--woos
    To lands where, save their conscience, none accuse;
    Where all partake the earth without dispute,
    And bread itself is gathered as a fruit;
    Where none contest the fields, the woods, the streams:--
    The goldless Age, where Gold disturbs no dreams,
    Inhabits or inhabited the shore,
    Till Europe taught them better than before;
    Bestowed her customs, and amended theirs,
    But left her vices also to their heirs.
    Away with this! behold them as they were,
    Do good with Nature, or with Nature err.
    "Huzza! for Otaheite!" was the cry,
    As stately swept the gallant vessel by.
    The breeze springs up; the lately flapping sail
    Extends its arch before the growing gale;
    In swifter ripples stream aside the seas,
    Which her bold bow flings off with dashing ease.
    Thus Argo ploughed the Euxine's virgin foam,
    But those she wafted still looked back to home;
    These spurn their country with their rebel bark,
    And fly her as the raven fled the Ark;
    And yet they seek to nestle with the dove,
    And tame their fiery spirits down to Love.

                            CANTO THE SECOND.

                    I.

    How pleasant were the songs of Toobonai,
    When Summer's Sun went down the coral bay!
    Come, let us to the islet's softest shade,
    And hear the warbling birds! the damsels said:
    The wood-dove from the forest depth shall coo,
    Like voices of the Gods from Bolotoo;
    We'll cull the flowers that grow above the dead,
    For these most bloom where rests the warrior's head;
    And we will sit in Twilight's face, and see
    The sweet Moon glancing through the Tooa tree,
    The lofty accents of whose sighing bough
    Shall sadly please us as we lean below;
    Or climb the steep, and view the surf in vain
    Wrestle with rocky giants o'er the main,
    Which spurn in columns back the baffled spray.
    How beautiful are these! how happy they,
    Who, from the toil and tumult of their lives,
    Steal to look down where nought but Ocean strives!
    Even He too loves at times the blue lagoon,
    And smooths his ruffled mane beneath the Moon.

                    II.

    Yes--from the sepulchre we'll gather flowers,
    Then feast like spirits in their promised bowers,
    Then plunge and revel in the rolling surf,
    Then lay our limbs along the tender turf,
    And, wet and shining from the sportive toil,
    Anoint our bodies with the fragrant oil,
    And plait our garlands gathered from the grave,
    And wear the wreaths that sprung from out the brave.
    But lo! night comes, the Mooa woos us back,
    The sound of mats are heard along our track;
    Anon the torchlight dance shall fling its sheen
    In flashing mazes o'er the Marly's green;
    And we too will be there; we too recall
    The memory bright with many a festival,
    Ere Fiji blew the shell of war, when foes
    For the first time were wafted in canoes.
    Alas! for them the flower of manhood bleeds;
    Alas! for them our fields are rank with weeds:
    Forgotten is the rapture, or unknown,
    Of wandering with the Moon and Love alone.
    But be it so:--they taught us how to wield
    The club, and rain our arrows o'er the field:
    Now let them reap the harvest of their art!
    But feast to-night! to-morrow we depart.
    Strike up the dance! the Cava bowl fill high!
    Drain every drop!--to-morrow we may die.
    In summer garments be our limbs arrayed;
    Around our waists the Tappa's white displayed;
    Thick wreaths shall form our coronal, like Spring's,
    And round our necks shall glance the Hooni strings;
    So shall their brighter hues contrast the glow
    Of the dusk bosoms that beat high below.

                    III.

    But now the dance is o'er--yet stay awhile;
    Ah, pause! nor yet put out the social smile.
    To-morrow for the Mooa we depart,
    But not to-night--to-night is for the heart.
    Again bestow the wreaths we gently woo,
    Ye young Enchantresses of gay Licoo!
    How lovely are your forms! how every sense
    Bows to your beauties, softened, but intense,
    Like to the flowers on Mataloco's steep,
    Which fling their fragrance far athwart the deep!--
    We too will see Licoo; but--oh! my heart!--
    What do I say?--to-morrow we depart!

                    IV.

    Thus rose a song--the harmony of times
    Before the winds blew Europe o'er these climes.
    True, they had vices--such are Nature's growth--
    But only the barbarian's--we have both;
    The sordor of civilisation, mixed
    With all the savage which Man's fall hath fixed.
    Who hath not seen Dissimulation's reign,
    The prayers of Abel linked to deeds of Cain?
    Who such would see may from his lattice view
    The Old World more degraded than the New,--
    Now new no more, save where Columbia rears
    Twin giants, born by Freedom to her spheres,
    Where Chimborazo, over air,--earth,--wave,--
    Glares with his Titan eye, and sees no slave.

                    V.

    Such was this ditty of Tradition's days,
    Which to the dead a lingering fame conveys
    In song, where Fame as yet hath left no sign
    Beyond the sound whose charm is half divine;
    Which leaves no record to the sceptic eye,
    But yields young History all to Harmony;
    A boy Achilles, with the Centaur's lyre
    In hand, to teach him to surpass his sire.
    For one long-cherished ballad's simple stave,
    Rung from the rock, or mingled with the wave,
    Or from the bubbling streamlet's grassy side,
    Or gathering mountain echoes as they glide,
    Hath greater power o'er each true heart and ear,
    Than all the columns Conquest's minions rear;
    Invites, when Hieroglyphics are a theme
    For sages' labours, or the student's dream;
    Attracts, when History's volumes are a toil,--
    The first, the freshest bud of Feeling's soil.
    Such was this rude rhyme--rhyme is of the rude--
    But such inspired the Norseman's solitude,
    Who came and conquered; such, wherever rise
    Lands which no foes destroy or civilise,
    Exist: and what can our accomplished art
    Of verse do more than reach the awakened heart?

                    VI.

    And sweetly now those untaught melodies
    Broke the luxurious silence of the skies,
    The sweet siesta of a summer day,
    The tropic afternoon of Toobonai,
    When every flower was bloom, and air was balm,
    And the first breath began to stir the palm,
    The first yet voiceless wind to urge the wave
    All gently to refresh the thirsty cave,
    Where sat the Songstress with the stranger boy,
    Who taught her Passion's desolating joy,
    Too powerful over every heart, but most
    O'er those who know not how it may be lost;
    O'er those who, burning in the new-born fire,
    Like martyrs revel in their funeral pyre,
    With such devotion to their ecstacy,
    That Life knows no such rapture as to die:
    And die they do; for earthly life has nought
    Matched with that burst of Nature, even in thought;
    And all our dreams of better life above
    But close in one eternal gush of Love.

                    VII.

    There sat the gentle savage of the wild,
    In growth a woman, though in years a child,
    As childhood dates within our colder clime,
    Where nought is ripened rapidly save crime;
    The infant of an infant world, as pure
    From Nature--lovely, warm, and premature;
    Dusky like night, but night with all her stars;
    Or cavern sparkling with its native spars;
    With eyes that were a language and a spell,
    A form like Aphrodite's in her shell,
    With all her loves around her on the deep,
    Voluptuous as the first approach of sleep;
    Yet full of life--for through her tropic cheek
    The blush would make its way, and all but speak;
    The sun-born blood suffused her neck, and threw
    O'er her clear nut-brown skin a lucid hue,
    Like coral reddening through the darkened wave,
    Which draws the diver to the crimson cave.
    Such was this daughter of the southern seas,
    Herself a billow in her energies,
    To bear the bark of others' happiness,
    Nor feel a sorrow till their joy grew less:
    Her wild and warm yet faithful bosom knew
    No joy like what it gave; her hopes ne'er drew
    Aught from Experience, that chill touchstone, whose
    Sad proof reduces all things from their hues:
    She feared no ill, because she knew it not,
    Or what she knew was soon--too soon--forgot:
    Her smiles and tears had passed, as light winds pass
    O'er lakes to ruffle, not destroy, their glass,
    Whose depths unsearched, and fountains from the hill,
    Restore their surface, in itself so still,
    Until the Earthquake tear the Naiad's cave,
    Root up the spring, and trample on the wave,
    And crush the living waters to a mass,
    The amphibious desert of the dank morass!
    And must their fate be hers? The eternal change
    But grasps Humanity with quicker range;
    And they who fall but fall as worlds will fall,
    To rise, if just, a Spirit o'er them all.

                    VIII.

    And who is he? the blue-eyed northern child
    Of isles more known to man, but scarce less wild;
    The fair-haired offspring of the Hebrides,
    Where roars the Pentland with its whirling seas;
    Rocked in his cradle by the roaring wind,
    The tempest-born in body and in mind,
    His young eyes opening on the ocean-foam,
    Had from that moment deemed the deep his home,
    The giant comrade of his pensive moods,
    The sharer of his craggy solitudes,
    The only Mentor of his youth, where'er
    His bark was borne; the sport of wave and air;
    A careless thing, who placed his choice in chance,
    Nursed by the legends of his land's romance;
    Eager to hope, but not less firm to bear,
    Acquainted with all feelings save despair.
    Placed in the Arab's clime he would have been
    As bold a rover as the sands have seen,
    And braved their thirst with as enduring lip
    As Ishmael, wafted on his Desert-Ship;
    Fixed upon Chili's shore, a proud cacique:
    On Hellas' mountains, a rebellious Greek;
    Born in a tent, perhaps a Tamerlane;
    Bred to a throne, perhaps unfit to reign.
    For the same soul that rends its path to sway,
    If reared to such, can find no further prey
    Beyond itself, and must retrace its way,
    Plunging for pleasure into pain: the same
    Spirit which made a Nero, Rome's worst shame,
    A humbler state and discipline of heart,
    Had formed his glorious namesake's counterpart;
    But grant his vices, grant them all his own,
    How small their theatre without a throne!

                    IX.

    Thou smilest:--these comparisons seem high
    To those who scan all things with dazzled eye;
    Linked with the unknown name of one whose doom
    Has nought to do with glory or with Rome,
    With Chili, Hellas, or with Araby;--
    Thou smilest?--Smile; 'tis better thus than sigh;
    Yet such he might have been; he was a man,
    A soaring spirit, ever in the van,
    A patriot hero or despotic chief,
    To form a nation's glory or its grief,
    Born under auspices which make us more
    Or less than we delight to ponder o'er.
    But these are visions; say, what was he here?
    A blooming boy, a truant mutineer.
    The fair-haired Torquil, free as Ocean's spray,
    The husband of the bride of Toobonai.

                    X.

    By Neuha's side he sate, and watched the waters,--
    Neuha, the sun-flower of the island daughters,
    Highborn, (a birth at which the herald smiles,
    Without a scutcheon for these secret isles,)
    Of a long race, the valiant and the free,
    The naked knights of savage chivalry,
    Whose grassy cairns ascend along the shore;
    And thine--I've seen--Achilles! do no more.
    She, when the thunder-bearing strangers came,
    In vast canoes, begirt with bolts of flame,
    Topped with tall trees, which, loftier than the palm,
    Seemed rooted in the deep amidst its calm:
    But when the winds awakened, shot forth wings
    Broad as the cloud along the horizon flings,
    And swayed the waves, like cities of the sea,
    Making the very billows look less free;--
    She, with her paddling oar and dancing prow,
    Shot through the surf, like reindeer through the snow,
    Swift-gliding o'er the breaker's whitening edge,
    Light as a Nereid in her ocean sledge,
    And gazed and wondered at the giant hulk,
    Which heaved from wave to wave its trampling bulk.
    The anchor dropped; it lay along the deep,
    Like a huge lion in the sun asleep,
    While round it swarmed the Proas' flitting chain,
    Like summer bees that hum around his mane.

                    XI.

    The white man landed!--need the rest be told?
    The New World stretched its dusk hand to the Old;
    Each was to each a marvel, and the tie
    Of wonder warmed to better sympathy.
    Kind was the welcome of the sun-born sires,
    And kinder still their daughters' gentler fires.
    Their union grew: the children of the storm
    Found beauty linked with many a dusky form;
    While these in turn admired the paler glow,
    Which seemed so white in climes that knew no snow.
    The chace, the race, the liberty to roam,
    The soil where every cottage showed a home;
    The sea-spread net, the lightly launched canoe,
    Which stemmed the studded archipelago,
    O'er whose blue bosom rose the starry isles;
    The healthy slumber, earned by sportive toils;
    The palm, the loftiest Dryad of the woods,
    Within whose bosom infant Bacchus broods,
    While eagles scarce build higher than the crest
    Which shadows o'er the vineyard in her breast;
    The Cava feast, the Yam, the Cocoa's root,
    Which bears at once the cup, and milk, and fruit;
    The Bread-tree, which, without the ploughshare, yields
    The unreaped harvest of unfurrowed fields,
    And bakes its unadulterated loaves
    Without a furnace in unpurchased groves,
    And flings off famine from its fertile breast,
    A priceless market for the gathering guest;--
    These, with the luxuries of seas and woods,
    The airy joys of social solitudes,
    Tamed each rude wanderer to the sympathies
    Of those who were more happy, if less wise,
    Did more than Europe's discipline had done,
    And civilised Civilisation's son!

                    XII.

    Of these, and there was many a willing pair,
    Neuha and Torquil were not the least fair:
    Both children of the isles, though distant far;
    Both born beneath a sea-presiding star;
    Both nourished amidst Nature's native scenes,
    Loved to the last, whatever intervenes
    Between us and our Childhood's sympathy,
    Which still reverts to what first caught the eye.
    He who first met the Highlands' swelling blue
    Will love each peak that shows a kindred hue,
    Hail in each crag a friend's familiar face,
    And clasp the mountain in his Mind's embrace.
    Long have I roamed through lands which are not mine,
    Adored the Alp, and loved the Apennine,
    Revered Parnassus, and beheld the steep
    Jove's Ida and Olympus crown the deep:
    But 'twas not all long ages' lore, nor all
    Their nature held me in their thrilling thrall;
    The infant rapture still survived the boy,
    And Loch-na-gar with Ida looked o'er Troy,
    Mixed Celtic memories with the Phrygian mount,
    And Highland linns with Castalie's clear fount.
    Forgive me, Homer's universal shade!
    Forgive me, Phoebus! that my fancy strayed;
    The North and Nature taught me to adore
    Your scenes sublime, from those beloved before.

                    XIII.

    The love which maketh all things fond and fair,
    The youth which makes one rainbow of the air,
    The dangers past, that make even Man enjoy
    The pause in which he ceases to destroy,
    The mutual beauty, which the sternest feel
    Strike to their hearts like lightning to the steel,
    United the half savage and the whole,
    The maid and boy, in one absorbing soul.
    No more the thundering memory of the fight
    Wrapped his weaned bosom in its dark delight;
    No more the irksome restlessness of Rest
    Disturbed him like the eagle in her nest,
    Whose whetted beak and far-pervading eye
    Darts for a victim over all the sky:
    His heart was tamed to that voluptuous state,
    At once Elysian and effeminate,
    Which leaves no laurels o'er the Hero's urn;--
    These wither when for aught save blood they burn;
    Yet when their ashes in their nook are laid,
    Doth not the myrtle leave as sweet a shade?
    Had Caesar known but Cleopatra's kiss,
    Rome had been free, the world had not been his.
    And what have Caesar's deeds and Caesar's fame
    Done for the earth? We feel them in our shame.
    The gory sanction of his Glory stains
    The rust which tyrants cherish on our chains.
    Though Glory--Nature--Reason--Freedom, bid
    Roused millions do what single Brutus did--
    Sweep these mere mock-birds of the Despot's song
    From the tall bough where they have perched so long,--
    Still are we hawked at by such mousing owls,
    And take for falcons those ignoble fowls,
    When but a word of freedom would dispel
    These bugbears, as their terrors show too well.

                    XIV.

    Rapt in the fond forgetfulness of life,
    Neuha, the South Sea girl, was all a wife,
    With no distracting world to call her off
    From Love; with no Society to scoff
    At the new transient flame; no babbling crowd
    Of coxcombry in admiration loud,
    Or with adulterous whisper to alloy
    Her duty, and her glory, and her joy:
    With faith and feelings naked as her form,
    She stood as stands a rainbow in a storm,
    Changing its hues with bright variety,
    But still expanding lovelier o'er the sky,
    Howe'er its arch may swell, its colours move,
    The cloud-compelling harbinger of Love.

                    XV.

    Here, in this grotto of the wave-worn shore,
    They passed the Tropic's red meridian o'er;
    Nor long the hours--they never paused o'er time,
    Unbroken by the clock's funereal chime,
    Which deals the daily pittance of our span,
    And points and mocks with iron laugh at man.
    What deemed they of the future or the past?
    The present, like a tyrant, held them fast:
    Their hour-glass was the sea-sand, and the tide,
    Like her smooth billow, saw their moments glide
    Their clock the Sun, in his unbounded tower
    They reckoned not, whose day was but an hour;
    The nightingale, their only vesper-bell,
    Sung sweetly to the rose the day's farewell;
    The broad Sun set, but not with lingering sweep,
    As in the North he mellows o'er the deep;
    But fiery, full, and fierce, as if he left
    The World for ever, earth of light bereft,
    Plunged with red forehead down along the wave,
    As dives a hero headlong to his grave.
    Then rose they, looking first along the skies,
    And then for light into each other's eyes,
    Wondering that Summer showed so brief a sun,
    And asking if indeed the day were done.

                    XVI.

    And let not this seem strange: the devotee
    Lives not in earth, but in his ecstasy;
    Around him days and worlds are heedless driven,
    His Soul is gone before his dust to Heaven.
    Is Love less potent? No--his path is trod,
    Alike uplifted gloriously to God;
    Or linked to all we know of Heaven below,
    The other better self, whose joy or woe
    Is more than ours; the all-absorbing flame
    Which, kindled by another, grows the same,
    Wrapt in one blaze; the pure, yet funeral pile,
    Where gentle hearts, like Bramins, sit and smile.
    How often we forget all time, when lone,
    Admiring Nature's universal throne,
    Her woods--her wilds--her waters--the intense
    Reply of hers to our intelligence!
    Live not the Stars and Mountains? Are the Waves
    Without a spirit? Are the dropping caves
    Without a feeling in their silent tears?
    No, no;--they woo and clasp us to their spheres,
    Dissolve this clog and clod of clay before
    Its hour, and merge our soul in the great shore.
    Strip off this fond and false identity!--
    Who thinks of self when gazing on the sky?
    And who, though gazing lower, ever thought,
    In the young moments ere the heart is taught
    Time's lesson, of Man's baseness or his own?
    All Nature is his realm, and Love his throne.

                    XVII.

    Neuha arose, and Torquil: Twilight's hour
    Came sad and softly to their rocky bower,
    Which, kindling by degrees its dewy spars,
    Echoed their dim light to the mustering stars.
    Slowly the pair, partaking Nature's calm,
    Sought out their cottage, built beneath the palm;
    Now smiling and now silent, as the scene;
    Lovely as Love--the Spirit!--when serene.
    The Ocean scarce spoke louder with his swell,
    Than breathes his mimic murmurer in the shell,
    As, far divided from his parent deep,
    The sea-born infant cries, and will not sleep,
    Raising his little plaint in vain, to rave
    For the broad bosom of his nursing wave:
    The woods drooped darkly, as inclined to rest,
    The tropic bird wheeled rockward to his nest,
    And the blue sky spread round them like a lake
    Of peace, where Piety her thirst might slake.

                    XVIII.

    But through the palm and plantain, hark, a Voice!
    Not such as would have been a lover's choice,
    In such an hour, to break the air so still;
    No dying night-breeze, harping o'er the hill,
    Striking the strings of nature, rock and tree,
    Those best and earliest lyres of Harmony,
    With Echo for their chorus; nor the alarm
    Of the loud war-whoop to dispel the charm;
    Nor the soliloquy of the hermit owl,
    Exhaling all his solitary soul,
    The dim though large-eyed winged anchorite,
    Who peals his dreary Paean o'er the night;
    But a loud, long, and naval whistle, shrill
    As ever started through a sea-bird's bill;
    And then a pause, and then a hoarse "Hillo!
    Torquil, my boy! what cheer? Ho! brother, ho!"
    "Who hails?" cried Torquil, following with his eye
    The sound. "Here's one," was all the brief reply.

                    XIX.

    But here the herald of the self-same mouth
    Came breathing o'er the aromatic south,
    Not like a "bed of violets" on the gale,
    But such as wafts its cloud o'er grog or ale,
    Borne from a short frail pipe, which yet had blown
    Its gentle odours over either zone,
    And, puffed where'er winds rise or waters roll,
    Had wafted smoke from Portsmouth to the Pole,
    Opposed its vapour as the lightning flashed,
    And reeked, 'midst mountain-billows, unabashed,
    To Aeolus a constant sacrifice,
    Through every change of all the varying skies.
    And what was he who bore it?--I may err,
    But deem him sailor or philosopher.
    Sublime Tobacco! which from East to West
    Cheers the tar's labour or the Turkman's rest;
    Which on the Moslem's ottoman divides
    His hours, and rivals opium and his brides;
    Magnificent in Stamboul, but less grand,
    Though not less loved, in Wapping or the Strand;
    Divine in hookas, glorious in a pipe,
    When tipped with amber, mellow, rich, and ripe:
    Like other charmers, wooing the caress,
    More dazzlingly when daring in full dress;
    Yet thy true lovers more admire by far
    Thy naked beauties--Give me a cigar!

                    XX.

    Through the approaching darkness of the wood
    A human figure broke the solitude,
    Fantastically, it may be, arrayed,
    A seaman in a savage masquerade;
    Such as appears to rise out from the deep,
    When o'er the line the merry vessels sweep,
    And the rough Saturnalia of the tar
    Flock o'er the deck, in Neptune's borrowed car;
    And, pleased, the God of Ocean sees his name
    Revive once more, though but in mimic game
    Of his true sons, who riot in the breeze
    Undreamt of in his native Cyclades.
    Still the old God delights, from out the main,
    To snatch some glimpses of his ancient reign.
    Our sailor's jacket, though in ragged trim,
    His constant pipe, which never yet burned dim,
    His foremast air, and somewhat rolling gait,
    Like his dear vessel, spoke his former state;
    But then a sort of kerchief round his head,
    Not over tightly bound, nor nicely spread;
    And, 'stead of trowsers (ah! too early torn!
    For even the mildest woods will have their thorn)
    A curious sort of somewhat scanty mat
    Now served for inexpressibles and hat;
    His naked feet and neck, and sunburnt face,
    Perchance might suit alike with either race.
    His arms were all his own, our Europe's growth,
    Which two worlds bless for civilising both;
    The musket swung behind his shoulders broad,
    And somewhat stooped by his marine abode,
    But brawny as the boar's; and hung beneath,
    His cutlass drooped, unconscious of a sheath,
    Or lost or worn away; his pistols were
    Linked to his belt, a matrimonial pair--
    (Let not this metaphor appear a scoff,
    Though one missed fire, the other would go off);
    These, with a bayonet, not so free from rust
    As when the arm-chest held its brighter trust,
    Completed his accoutrements, as Night
    Surveyed him in his garb heteroclite.

                    XXI.

    "What cheer, Ben Bunting?" cried (when in full view
    Our new acquaintance) Torquil. "Aught of new?"
    "Ey, ey!" quoth Ben, "not new, but news enow;
    A strange sail in the offing."--"Sail! and how?
    What! could you make her out? It cannot be;
    I've seen no rag of canvass on the sea."
    "Belike," said Ben, "you might not from the bay,
    But from the bluff-head, where I watched to-day,
    I saw her in the doldrums; for the wind
    Was light and baffling."--"When the Sun declined
    Where lay she? had she anchored?"--"No, but still
    She bore down on us, till the wind grew still."
    "Her flag?"--"I had no glass: but fore and aft,
    Egad! she seemed a wicked-looking craft."
    "Armed?"--"I expect so;--sent on the look-out:
    'Tis time, belike, to put our helm about."
    "About?--Whate'er may have us now in chase,
    We'll make no running fight, for that were base;
    We will die at our quarters, like true men."
    "Ey, ey! for that 'tis all the same to Ben."
    "Does Christian know this?"--"Aye; he has piped all hands
    To quarters. They are furbishing the stands
    Of arms; and we have got some guns to bear,
    And scaled them. You are wanted."--"That's but fair;
    And if it were not, mine is not the soul
    To leave my comrades helpless on the shoal.
    My Neuha! ah! and must my fate pursue
    Not me alone, but one so sweet and true?
    But whatsoe'er betide, ah, Neuha! now
    Unman me not: the hour will not allow
    A tear; I am thine whatever intervenes!"
    "Right," quoth Ben; "that will do for the marines."

                             CANTO THE THIRD.

                    I.

    The fight was o'er; the flashing through the gloom,
    Which robes the cannon as he wings a tomb,
    Had ceased; and sulphury vapours upward driven
    Had left the Earth, and but polluted Heaven:
    The rattling roar which rung in every volley
    Had left the echoes to their melancholy;
    No more they shrieked their horror, boom for boom;
    The strife was done, the vanquished had their doom;
    The mutineers were crushed, dispersed, or ta'en,
    Or lived to deem the happiest were the slain.
    Few, few escaped, and these were hunted o'er
    The isle they loved beyond their native shore.
    No further home was theirs, it seemed, on earth,
    Once renegades to that which gave them birth;
    Tracked like wild beasts, like them they sought the wild,
    As to a Mother's bosom flies the child;
    But vainly wolves and lions seek their den,
    And still more vainly men escape from men.

                    II.

    Beneath a rock whose jutting base protrudes
    Far over Ocean in its fiercest moods,
    When scaling his enormous crag the wave
    Is hurled down headlong, like the foremost brave,
    And falls back on the foaming crowd behind,
    Which fight beneath the banners of the wind,
    But now at rest, a little remnant drew
    Together, bleeding, thirsty, faint, and few;
    But still their weapons in their hands, and still
    With something of the pride of former will,
    As men not all unused to meditate,
    And strive much more than wonder at their fate.
    Their present lot was what they had foreseen,
    And dared as what was likely to have been;
    Yet still the lingering hope, which deemed their lot
    Not pardoned, but unsought for or forgot,
    Or trusted that, if sought, their distant caves
    Might still be missed amidst the world of waves,
    Had weaned their thoughts in part from what they saw
    And felt, the vengeance of their country's law.
    Their sea-green isle, their guilt-won Paradise,
    No more could shield their Virtue or their Vice:
    Their better feelings, if such were, were thrown
    Back on themselves,--their sins remained alone.
    Proscribed even in their second country, they
    Were lost; in vain the World before them lay;
    All outlets seemed secured. Their new allies
    Had fought and bled in mutual sacrifice;
    But what availed the club and spear, and arm
    Of Hercules, against the sulphury charm,
    The magic of the thunder, which destroyed
    The warrior ere his strength could be employed?
    Dug, like a spreading pestilence, the grave
    No less of human bravery than the brave!
    Their own scant numbers acted all the few
    Against the many oft will dare and do;
    But though the choice seems native to die free,
    Even Greece can boast but one Thermopylae,
    Till now, when she has forged her broken chain
    Back to a sword, and dies and lives again!

                    III.

    Beside the jutting rock the few appeared,
    Like the last remnant of the red-deer's herd;
    Their eyes were feverish, and their aspect worn,
    But still the hunter's blood was on their horn.
    A little stream came tumbling from the height,
    And straggling into ocean as it might,
    Its bounding crystal frolicked in the ray,
    And gushed from cliff to crag with saltless spray;
    Close on the wild, wide ocean, yet as pure
    And fresh as Innocence, and more secure,
    Its silver torrent glittered o'er the deep,
    As the shy chamois' eye o'erlooks the steep,
    While far below the vast and sullen swell
    Of Ocean's alpine azure rose and fell.
    To this young spring they rushed,--all feelings first
    Absorbed in Passion's and in Nature's thirst,--
    Drank as they do who drink their last, and threw
    Their arms aside to revel in its dew;
    Cooled their scorched throats, and washed the gory stains
    From wounds whose only bandage might be chains;
    Then, when their drought was quenched, looked sadly round,
    As wondering how so many still were found
    Alive and fetterless:--but silent all,
    Each sought his fellow's eyes, as if to call
    On him for language which his lips denied,
    As though their voices with their cause had died.

                    IV.

    Stern, and aloof a little from the rest,
    Stood Christian, with his arms across his chest.
    The ruddy, reckless, dauntless hue once spread
    Along his cheek was livid now as lead;
    His light-brown locks, so graceful in their flow,
    Now rose like startled vipers o'er his brow.
    Still as a statue, with his lips comprest
    To stifle even the breath within his breast,
    Fast by the rock, all menacing, but mute,
    He stood; and, save a slight beat of his foot,
    Which deepened now and then the sandy dint
    Beneath his heel, his form seemed turned to flint.
    Some paces further Torquil leaned his head
    Against a bank, and spoke not, but he bled,--
    Not mortally:--his worst wound was within;
    His brow was pale, his blue eyes sunken in,
    And blood-drops, sprinkled o'er his yellow hair,
    Showed that his faintness came not from despair,
    But Nature's ebb. Beside him was another,
    Rough as a bear, but willing as a brother,--
    Ben Bunting, who essayed to wash, and wipe,
    And bind his wound--then calmly lit his pipe,
    A trophy which survived a hundred fights,
    A beacon which had cheered ten thousand nights.
    The fourth and last of this deserted group
    Walked up and down--at times would stand, then stoop
    To pick a pebble up--then let it drop--
    Then hurry as in haste--then quickly stop--
    Then cast his eyes on his companions--then
    Half whistle half a tune, and pause again--
    And then his former movements would redouble,
    With something between carelessness and trouble.
    This is a long description, but applies
    To scarce five minutes passed before the eyes;
    But yet what minutes! Moments like to these
    Rend men's lives into immortalities.

                    V.

    At length Jack Skyscrape, a mercurial man,
    Who fluttered over all things like a fan,
    More brave than firm, and more disposed to dare
    And die at once than wrestle with despair,
    Exclaimed, "G--d damn!"--those syllables intense,--
    Nucleus of England's native eloquence,
    As the Turk's "Allah!" or the Roman's more
    Pagan "Proh Jupiter!" was wont of yore
    To give their first impressions such a vent,
    By way of echo to embarrassment.
    Jack was embarrassed,--never hero more,
    And as he knew not what to say, he swore:
    Nor swore in vain; the long congenial sound
    Revived Ben Bunting from his pipe profound;
    He drew it from his mouth, and looked full wise,
    But merely added to the oath his eyes;
    Thus rendering the imperfect phrase complete,
    A peroration I need not repeat.

                    VI.

    But Christian, of a higher order, stood
    Like an extinct volcano in his mood;
    Silent, and sad, and savage,--with the trace
    Of passion reeking from his clouded face;
    Till lifting up again his sombre eye,
    It glanced on Torquil, who leaned faintly by.
    "And is it thus?" he cried, "unhappy boy!
    And thee, too, thee--my madness must destroy!"
    He said, and strode to where young Torquil stood,
    Yet dabbled with his lately flowing blood;
    Seized his hand wistfully, but did not press,
    And shrunk as fearful of his own caress;
    Enquired into his state: and when he heard
    The wound was slighter than he deemed or feared,
    A moment's brightness passed along his brow,
    As much as such a moment would allow.
    "Yes," he exclaimed, "we are taken in the toil,
    But not a coward or a common spoil;
    Dearly they have bought us--dearly still may buy,--
    And I must fall; but have you strength to fly?
    'Twould be some comfort still, could you survive;
    Our dwindled band is now too few to strive.
    Oh! for a sole canoe! though but a shell,
    To bear you hence to where a hope may dwell!
    For me, my lot is what I sought; to be,
    In life or death, the fearless and the free."

                    VII.

    Even as he spoke, around the promontory,
    Which nodded o'er the billows high and hoary,
    A dark speck dotted Ocean: on it flew
    Like to the shadow of a roused sea-mew;
    Onward it came--and, lo! a second followed--
    Now seen--now hid--where Ocean's vale was hollowed;
    And near, and nearer, till the dusky crew
    Presented well-known aspects to the view,
    Till on the surf their skimming paddles play,
    Buoyant as wings, and flitting through the spray;--
    Now perching on the wave's high curl, and now
    Dashed downward in the thundering foam below,
    Which flings it broad and boiling sheet on sheet,
    And slings its high flakes, shivered into sleet:
    But floating still through surf and swell, drew nigh
    The barks, like small birds through a lowering sky.
    Their art seemed nature--such the skill to sweep
    The wave of these born playmates of the deep.

                    VIII.

    And who the first that, springing on the strand,
    Leaped like a Nereid from her shell to land,
    With dark but brilliant skin, and dewy eye
    Shining with love, and hope, and constancy?
    Neuha--the fond, the faithful, the adored--
    Her heart on Torquil's like a torrent poured;
    And smiled, and wept, and near, and nearer clasped,
    As if to be assured 'twas him she grasped;
    Shuddered to see his yet warm wound, and then,
    To find it trivial, smiled and wept again.
    She was a warrior's daughter, and could bear
    Such sights, and feel, and mourn, but not despair.
    Her lover lived,--nor foes nor fears could blight
    That full-blown moment in its all delight:
    Joy trickled in her tears, joy filled the sob
    That rocked her heart till almost heard to throb;
    And Paradise was breathing in the sigh
    Of Nature's child in Nature's ecstasy.

                    IX.

    The sterner spirits who beheld that meeting
    Were not unmoved; who are, when hearts are greeting?
    Even Christian gazed upon the maid and boy
    With tearless eye, but yet a gloomy joy
    Mixed with those bitter thoughts the soul arrays
    In hopeless visions of our better days,
    When all's gone--to the rainbow's latest ray.
    "And but for me!" he said, and turned away;
    Then gazed upon the pair, as in his den
    A lion looks upon his cubs again;
    And then relapsed into his sullen guise,
    As heedless of his further destinies.

                    X.

    But brief their time for good or evil thought;
    The billows round the promontory brought
    The plash of hostile oars.--Alas! who made
    That sound a dread? All around them seemed arrayed
    Against them, save the bride of Toobonai:
    She, as she caught the first glimpse o'er the bay
    Of the armed boats, which hurried to complete
    The remnant's ruin with their flying feet,
    Beckoned the natives round her to their prows,
    Embarked their guests and launched their light canoes;
    In one placed Christian and his comrades twain--
    But she and Torquil must not part again.
    She fixed him in her own.--Away! away!
    They cleared the breakers, dart along the bay,
    And towards a group of islets, such as bear
    The sea-bird's nest and seal's surf-hollowed lair,
    They skim the blue tops of the billows; fast
    They flew, and fast their fierce pursuers chased.
    They gain upon them--now they lose again,--
    Again make way and menace o'er the main;
    And now the two canoes in chase divide,
    And follow different courses o'er the tide,
    To baffle the pursuit.--Away! away!
    As Life is on each paddle's flight to-day,
    And more than Life or lives to Neuha: Love
    Freights the frail bark and urges to the cove;
    And now the refuge and the foe are nigh--
    Yet, yet a moment! Fly, thou light ark, fly!

                            CANTO THE FOURTH.

                    I.

    White as a white sail on a dusky sea,
    When half the horizon's clouded and half free,
    Fluttering between the dun wave and the sky,
    Is Hope's last gleam in Man's extremity.
    Her anchor parts; but still her snowy sail
    Attracts our eye amidst the rudest gale:
    Though every wave she climbs divides us more,
    The heart still follows from the loneliest shore.

                    II.

    Not distant from the isle of Toobonai,
    A black rock rears its bosom o'er the spray,
    The haunt of birds, a desert to mankind,
    Where the rough seal reposes from the wind,
    And sleeps unwieldy in his cavern dun,
    Or gambols with huge frolic in the sun:
    There shrilly to the passing oar is heard
    The startled echo of the Ocean bird,
    Who rears on its bare breast her callow brood,
    The feathered fishers of the solitude.
    A narrow segment of the yellow sand
    On one side forms the outline of a strand;
    Here the young turtle, crawling from his shell,
    Steals to the deep wherein his parents dwell;
    Chipped by the beam, a nursling of the day,
    But hatched for ocean by the fostering ray;
    The rest was one bleak precipice, as e'er
    Gave mariners a shelter and despair;
    A spot to make the saved regret the deck
    Which late went down, and envy the lost wreck.
    Such was the stern asylum Neuha chose
    To shield her lover from his following foes;
    But all its secret was not told; she knew
    In this a treasure hidden from the view.

                    III.

    Ere the canoes divided, near the spot,
    The men that manned what held her Torquil's lot,
    By her command removed, to strengthen more
    The skiff which wafted Christian from the shore.
    This he would have opposed; but with a smile
    She pointed calmly to the craggy isle,
    And bade him "speed and prosper." She would take
    The rest upon herself for Torquil's sake.
    They parted with this added aid; afar,
    The Proa darted like a shooting star,
    And gained on the pursuers, who now steered
    Right on the rock which she and Torquil neared.
    They pulled; her arm, though delicate, was free
    And firm as ever grappled with the sea,
    And yielded scarce to Torquil's manlier strength.
    The prow now almost lay within its length
    Of the crag's steep inexorable face,
    With nought but soundless waters for its base;
    Within a hundred boats' length was the foe,
    And now what refuge but their frail canoe?
    This Torquil asked with half upbraiding eye,
    Which said--"Has Neuha brought me here to die?
    Is this a place of safety, or a grave,
    And yon huge rock the tombstone of the wave?"

                    IV.

    They rested on their paddles, and uprose
    Neuha, and pointing to the approaching foes,
    Cried, "Torquil, follow me, and fearless follow!"
    Then plunged at once into the Ocean's hollow.
    There was no time to pause--the foes were near--
    Chains in his eye, and menace in his ear;
    With vigour they pulled on, and as they came,
    Hailed him to yield, and by his forfeit name.
    Headlong he leapt--to him the swimmer's skill
    Was native, and now all his hope from ill:
    But how, or where? He dived, and rose no more;
    The boat's crew looked amazed o'er sea and shore.
    There was no landing on that precipice,
    Steep, harsh, and slippery as a berg of ice.
    They watched awhile to see him float again,
    But not a trace rebubbled from the main:
    The wave rolled on, no ripple on its face,
    Since their first plunge recalled a single trace;
    The little whirl which eddied, and slight foam,
    That whitened o'er what seemed their latest home,
    White as a sepulchre above the pair
    Who left no marble (mournful as an heir)
    The quiet Proa wavering o'er the tide
    Was all that told of Torquil and his bride;
    And but for this alone the whole might seem
    The vanished phantom of a seaman's dream.
    They paused and searched in vain, then pulled away;
    Even Superstition now forbade their stay.
    Some said he had not plunged into the wave,
    But vanished like a corpse-light from a grave;
    Others, that something supernatural
    Glared in his figure, more than mortal tall;
    While all agreed that in his cheek and eye
    There was a dead hue of Eternity.
    Still as their oars receded from the crag,
    Round every weed a moment would they lag,
    Expectant of some token of their prey;
    But no--he had melted from them like the spray.

                    V.

    And where was he the Pilgrim of the Deep,
    Following the Nereid? Had they ceased to weep
    For ever? or, received in coral caves,
    Wrung life and pity from the softening waves?
    Did they with Ocean's hidden sovereigns dwell,
    And sound with Mermen the fantastic shell?
    Did Neuha with the mermaids comb her hair
    Flowing o'er ocean as it streamed in air?
    Or had they perished, and in silence slept
    Beneath the gulf wherein they boldly leapt?

                    VI.

    Young Neuha plunged into the deep, and he
    Followed: her track beneath her native sea
    Was as a native's of the element,
    So smoothly--bravely--brilliantly she went,
    Leaving a streak of light behind her heel,
    Which struck and flashed like an amphibious steel,
    Closely, and scarcely less expert to trace
    The depths where divers hold the pearl in chase,
    Torquil, the nursling of the northern seas,
    Pursued her liquid steps with heart and ease.
    Deep--deeper for an instant Neuha led
    The way--then upward soared--and as she spread
    Her arms, and flung the foam from off her locks,
    Laughed, and the sound was answered by the rocks.
    They had gained a central realm of earth again,
    But looked for tree, and field, and sky, in vain.
    Around she pointed to a spacious cave,
    Whose only portal was the keyless wave,
    (A hollow archway by the sun unseen,
    Save through the billows' glassy veil of green,
    In some transparent ocean holiday,
    When all the finny people are at play,)
    Wiped with her hair the brine from Torquil's eyes,
    And clapped her hands with joy at his surprise;
    Led him to where the rock appeared to jut,
    And form a something like a Triton's hut;
    For all was darkness for a space, till day,
    Through clefts above let in a sobered ray;
    As in some old cathedral's glimmering aisle
    The dusty monuments from light recoil,
    Thus sadly in their refuge submarine
    The vault drew half her shadow from the scene.

                    VII.

    Forth from her bosom the young savage drew
    A pine torch, strongly girded with gnatoo;
    A plantain-leaf o'er all, the more to keep
    Its latent sparkle from the sapping deep.
    This mantle kept it dry; then from a nook
    Of the same plantain-leaf a flint she took,
    A few shrunk withered twigs, and from the blade
    Of Torquil's knife struck fire, and thus arrayed
    The grot with torchlight. Wide it was and high,
    And showed a self-born Gothic canopy;
    The arch upreared by Nature's architect,
    The architrave some Earthquake might erect;
    The buttress from some mountain's bosom hurled,
    When the Poles crashed, and water was the world;
    Or hardened from some earth-absorbing fire,
    While yet the globe reeked from its funeral pyre;
    The fretted pinnacle, the aisle, the nave,
    Were there, all scooped by Darkness from her cave.
    There, with a little tinge of phantasy,
    Fantastic faces moped and mowed on high,
    And then a mitre or a shrine would fix
    The eye upon its seeming crucifix.
    Thus Nature played with the stalactites,
    And built herself a Chapel of the Seas.

                    VIII.

    And Neuha took her Torquil by the hand,
    And waved along the vault her kindled brand,
    And led him into each recess, and showed
    The secret places of their new abode.
    Nor these alone, for all had been prepared
    Before, to soothe the lover's lot she shared:
    The mat for rest; for dress the fresh gnatoo,
    And sandal oil to fence against the dew;
    For food the cocoa-nut, the yam, the bread
    Born of the fruit; for board the plantain spread
    With its broad leaf, or turtle-shell which bore
    A banquet in the flesh it covered o'er;
    The gourd with water recent from the rill,
    The ripe banana from the mellow hill;
    A pine-torch pile to keep undying light,
    And she herself, as beautiful as night,
    To fling her shadowy spirit o'er the scene,
    And make their subterranean world serene.
    She had foreseen, since first the stranger's sail
    Drew to their isle, that force or flight might fail,
    And formed a refuge of the rocky den
    For Torquil's safety from his countrymen.
    Each dawn had wafted there her light canoe,
    Laden with all the golden fruits that grew;
    Each eve had seen her gliding through the hour
    With all could cheer or deck their sparry bower;
    And now she spread her little store with smiles,
    The happiest daughter of the loving isles.

                    IX.

    She, as he gazed with grateful wonder, pressed
    Her sheltered love to her impassioned breast;
    And suited to her soft caresses, told
    An olden tale of Love,--for Love is old,
    Old as eternity, but not outworn
    With each new being born or to be born:
    How a young Chief, a thousand moons ago,
    Diving for turtle in the depths below,
    Had risen, in tracking fast his ocean prey,
    Into the cave which round and o'er them lay;
    How, in some desperate feud of after-time,
    He sheltered there a daughter of the clime,
    A foe beloved, and offspring of a foe,
    Saved by his tribe but for a captive's woe;
    How, when the storm of war was stilled, he led
    His island clan to where the waters spread
    Their deep-green shadow o'er the rocky door,
    Then dived--it seemed as if to rise no more:
    His wondering mates, amazed within their bark,
    Or deemed him mad, or prey to the blue shark;
    Rowed round in sorrow the sea-girded rock,
    Then paused upon their paddles from the shock;
    When, fresh and springing from the deep, they saw
    A Goddess rise--so deemed they in their awe;
    And their companion, glorious by her side,
    Proud and exulting in his Mermaid bride;
    And how, when undeceived, the pair they bore
    With sounding conchs and joyous shouts to shore;
    How they had gladly lived and calmly died,--
    And why not also Torquil and his bride?
    Not mine to tell the rapturous caress
    Which followed wildly in that wild recess
    This tale; enough that all within that cave
    Was love, though buried strong as in the grave,
    Where Abelard, through twenty years of death,
    When Eloisa's form was lowered beneath
    Their nuptial vault, his arms outstretched, and pressed
    The kindling ashes to his kindled breast.
    The waves without sang round their couch, their roar
    As much unheeded as if life were o'er;
    Within, their hearts made all their harmony,
    Love's broken murmur and more broken sigh.

                    X.

    And they, the cause and sharers of the shock
    Which left them exiles of the hollow rock,
    Where were they? O'er the sea for life they plied,
    To seek from Heaven the shelter men denied.
    Another course had been their choice--but where?
    The wave which bore them still their foes would bear,
    Who, disappointed of their former chase,
    In search of Christian now renewed their race.
    Eager with anger, their strong arms made way,
    Like vultures baffled of their previous prey.
    They gained upon them, all whose safety lay
    In some bleak crag or deeply-hidden bay:
    No further chance or choice remained; and right
    For the first further rock which met their sight
    They steered, to take their latest view of land,
    And yield as victims, or die sword in hand;
    Dismissed the natives and their shallop, who
    Would still have battled for that scanty crew;
    But Christian bade them seek their shore again,
    Nor add a sacrifice which were in vain;
    For what were simple bow and savage spear
    Against the arms which must be wielded here?

                    XI.

    They landed on a wild but narrow scene,
    Where few but Nature's footsteps yet had been;
    Prepared their arms, and with that gloomy eye,
    Stern and sustained, of man's extremity,
    When Hope is gone, nor Glory's self remains
    To cheer resistance against death or chains.--
    They stood, the three, as the three hundred stood
    Who dyed Thermopylae with holy blood.
    But, ah! how different! 'tis the cause makes all,
    Degrades or hallows courage in its fall.
    O'er them no fame, eternal and intense,
    Blazed through the clouds of Death and beckoned hence;
    No grateful country, smiling through her tears,
    Begun the praises of a thousand years;
    No nation's eyes would on their tomb be bent,
    No heroes envy them their monument;
    However boldly their warm blood was spilt,
    Their Life was shame, their Epitaph was guilt.
    And this they knew and felt, at least the one,
    The leader of the band he had undone;
    Who, born perchance for better things, had set
    His life upon a cast which lingered yet:
    But now the die was to be thrown, and all
    The chances were in favour of his fall:
    And such a fall! But still he faced the shock,
    Obdurate as a portion of the rock
    Whereon he stood, and fixed his levelled gun,
    Dark as a sullen cloud before the sun.

                    XII.

    The boat drew nigh, well armed, and firm the crew
    To act whatever Duty bade them do;
    Careless of danger, as the onward wind
    Is of the leaves it strews, nor looks behind.
    And, yet, perhaps, they rather wished to go
    Against a nation's than a native foe,
    And felt that this poor victim of self-will,
    Briton no more, had once been Britain's still.
    They hailed him to surrender--no reply;
    Their arms were poised, and glittered in the sky.
    They hailed again--no answer; yet once more
    They offered quarter louder than before.
    The echoes only, from the rock's rebound,
    Took their last farewell of the dying sound.
    Then flashed the flint, and blazed the volleying flame,
    And the smoke rose between them and their aim,
    While the rock rattled with the bullets' knell,
    Which pealed in vain, and flattened as they fell;
    Then flew the only answer to be given
    By those who had lost all hope in earth or heaven.
    After the first fierce peal as they pulled nigher,
    They heard the voice of Christian shout, "Now, fire!"
    And ere the word upon the echo died,
    Two fell; the rest assailed the rock's rough side,
    And, furious at the madness of their foes,
    Disdained all further efforts, save to close.
    But steep the crag, and all without a path,
    Each step opposed a bastion to their wrath,
    While, placed 'midst clefts the least accessible,
    Which Christian's eye was trained to mark full well,
    The three maintained a strife which must not yield,
    In spots where eagles might have chosen to build.
    Their every shot told; while the assailant fell,
    Dashed on the shingles like the limpet shell;
    But still enough survived, and mounted still,
    Scattering their numbers here and there, until
    Surrounded and commanded, though not nigh
    Enough for seizure, near enough to die,
    The desperate trio held aloof their fate
    But by a thread, like sharks who have gorged the bait;
    Yet to the very last they battled well,
    And not a groan informed their foes who fell.
    Christian died last--twice wounded; and once more
    Mercy was offered when they saw his gore;
    Too late for life, but not too late to die,
    With, though a hostile hand, to close his eye.
    A limb was broken, and he drooped along
    The crag, as doth a falcon reft of young.
    The sound revived him, or appeared to wake
    Some passion which a weakly gesture spake:
    He beckoned to the foremost, who drew nigh,
    But, as they neared, he reared his weapon high--
    His last ball had been aimed, but from his breast
    He tore the topmost button from his vest,
    Down the tube dashed it--levelled--fired, and smiled
    As his foe fell; then, like a serpent, coiled
    His wounded, weary form, to where the steep
    Looked desperate as himself along the deep;
    Cast one glance back, and clenched his hand, and shook
    His last rage 'gainst the earth which he forsook;
    Then plunged: the rock below received like glass
    His body crushed into one gory mass,
    With scarce a shred to tell of human form,
    Or fragment for the sea-bird or the worm;
    A fair-haired scalp, besmeared with blood and weeds,
    Yet reeked, the remnant of himself and deeds;
    Some splinters of his weapons (to the last,
    As long as hand could hold, he held them fast)
    Yet glittered, but at distance--hurled away
    To rust beneath the dew and dashing spray.
    The rest was nothing--save a life mis-spent,
    And soul--but who shall answer where it went?
    'Tis ours to bear, not judge the dead; and they
    Who doom to Hell, themselves are on the way,
    Unless these bullies of eternal pains
    Are pardoned their bad hearts for their worse brains.

                    XIII.

    The deed was over! All were gone or ta'en,
    The fugitive, the captive, or the slain.
    Chained on the deck, where once, a gallant crew,
    They stood with honour, were the wretched few
    Survivors of the skirmish on the isle;
    But the last rock left no surviving spoil.
    Cold lay they where they fell, and weltering,
    While o'er them flapped the sea-birds' dewy wing,
    Now wheeling nearer from the neighbouring surge,
    And screaming high their harsh and hungry dirge:
    But calm and careless heaved the wave below,
    Eternal with unsympathetic flow;
    Far o'er its face the Dolphins sported on,
    And sprung the flying fish against the sun,
    Till its dried wing relapsed from its brief height,
    To gather moisture for another flight.

                    XIV.

    'Twas morn; and Neuha, who by dawn of day
    Swam smoothly forth to catch the rising ray,
    And watch if aught approached the amphibious lair
    Where lay her lover, saw a sail in air:
    It flapped, it filled, and to the growing gale
    Bent its broad arch: her breath began to fail
    With fluttering fear, her heart beat thick and high,
    While yet a doubt sprung where its course might lie.
    But no! it came not; fast and far away
    The shadow lessened as it cleared the bay.
    She gazed, and flung the sea-foam from her eyes,
    To watch as for a rainbow in the skies.
    On the horizon verged the distant deck,
    Diminished, dwindled to a very speck--
    Then vanished. All was Ocean, all was Joy!
    Down plunged she through the cave to rouse her boy;
    Told all she had seen, and all she hoped, and all
    That happy love could augur or recall;
    Sprung forth again, with Torquil following free
    His bounding Nereid over the broad sea;
    Swam round the rock, to where a shallow cleft
    Hid the canoe that Neuha there had left
    Drifting along the tide, without an oar,
    That eve the strangers chased them from the shore;
    But when these vanished, she pursued her prow,
    Regained, and urged to where they found it now:
    Nor ever did more love and joy embark,
    Than now were wafted in that slender ark.

                    XV.

    Again their own shore rises on the view,
    No more polluted with a hostile hue;
    No sullen ship lay bristling o'er the foam,
    A floating dungeon:--all was Hope and Home!
    A thousand Proas darted o'er the bay,
    With sounding shells, and heralded their way;
    The chiefs came down, around the people poured,
    And welcomed Torquil as a son restored;
    The women thronged, embracing and embraced
    By Neuha, asking where they had been chased,
    And how escaped? The tale was told; and then
    One acclamation rent the sky again;
    And from that hour a new tradition gave
    Their sanctuary the name of "Neuha's Cave."
    A hundred fires, far flickering from the height,
    Blazed o'er the general revel of the night,
    The feast in honour of the guest, returned
    To Peace and Pleasure, perilously earned;
    A night succeeded by such happy days
    As only the yet infant world displays.                        

                       DON JUAN.

                        FRAGMENT
           ON THE BACK OF THE MS. OF CANTO I.

    I WOULD to Heaven that I were so much clay,
      As I am blood, bone, marrow, passion, feeling--
    Because at least the past were passed away,
      And for the future--(but I write this reeling,
    Having got drunk exceedingly to-day,
      So that I seem to stand upon the ceiling)
    I say--the future is a serious matter--
    And so--for God's sake--hock and soda-water!

                     DEDICATION.

                      I.

    BOB SOUTHEY! You're a poet--Poet-laureate,
      And representative of all the race;
    Although 't is true that you turned out a Tory at
      Last,--yours has lately been a common case;
    And now, my Epic Renegade! what are ye at?
      With all the Lakers, in and out of place?
    A nest of tuneful persons, to my eye
    Like "four and twenty Blackbirds in a pye;

                      II.

    "Which pye being opened they began to sing,"
      (This old song and new simile holds good),
    "A dainty dish to set before the King,"
      Or Regent, who admires such kind of food;--
    And Coleridge, too, has lately taken wing,
      But like a hawk encumbered with his hood,--
    Explaining Metaphysics to the nation--
    I wish he would explain his Explanation.

                      III.

    You, Bob! are rather insolent, you know,
      At being disappointed in your wish
    To supersede all warblers here below,
      And be the only Blackbird in the dish;
    And then you overstrain yourself, or so,
      And tumble downward like the flying fish
    Gasping on deck, because you soar too high, Bob,
    And fall, for lack of moisture, quite a-dry, Bob!

                      IV.

    And Wordsworth, in a rather long "Excursion,"
      (I think the quarto holds five hundred pages),
    Has given a sample from the vasty version
      Of his new system to perplex the sages;
    'T is poetry-at least by his assertion,
      And may appear so when the dog-star rages--
    And he who understands it would be able
    To add a story to the Tower of Babel.

                      V.

    You--Gentlemen! by dint of long seclusion
      From better company, have kept your own
    At Keswick, and, through still continued fusion
      Of one another's minds, at last have grown
    To deem as a most logical conclusion,
      That Poesy has wreaths for you alone:
    There is a narrowness in such a notion,
    Which makes me wish you'd change your lakes for Ocean.

                      VI.

    I would not imitate the petty thought,
      Nor coin my self-love to so base a vice,
    For all the glory your conversion brought,
      Since gold alone should not have been its price.
    You have your salary; was 't for that you wrought?
      And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.
    You're shabby fellows--true--but poets still,
    And duly seated on the Immortal Hill.

                      VII.

    Your bays may hide the baldness of your brows--
      Perhaps some virtuous blushes;--let them go--
    To you I envy neither fruit nor boughs--
      And for the fame you would engross below,
    The field is universal, and allows
      Scope to all such as feel the inherent glow:
    Scott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe, will try
    'Gainst you the question with posterity.

                      VIII.

    For me, who, wandering with pedestrian Muses,
      Contend not with you on the winged steed,
    I wish your fate may yield ye, when she chooses,
      The fame you envy, and the skill you need;
    And, recollect, a poet nothing loses
      In giving to his brethren their full meed
    Of merit--and complaint of present days
    Is not the certain path to future praise.

                      IX.

    He that reserves his laurels for posterity
      (Who does not often claim the bright reversion)
    Has generally no great crop to spare it, he
      Being only injured by his own assertion;
    And although here and there some glorious rarity
      Arise like Titan from the sea's immersion,
    The major part of such appellants go
    To--God knows where--for no one else can know.

                      X.

    If, fallen in evil days on evil tongues,
      Milton appealed to the Avenger, Time,
    If Time, the Avenger, execrates his wrongs,
      And makes the word "Miltonic" mean "Sublime,"
    He deigned not to belie his soul in songs,
      Nor turn his very talent to a crime;
    He did not loathe the Sire to laud the Son,
    But closed the tyrant-hater he begun.

                      XI.

    Think'st thou, could he--the blind Old Man--arise
      Like Samuel from the grave, to freeze once more
    The blood of monarchs with his prophecies,
      Or be alive again--again all hoar
    With time and trials, and those helpless eyes,
      And heartless daughters--worn--and pale--and poor;
    Would he adore a sultan? he obey
    The intellectual eunuch Castlereagh?

                      XII.

    Cold-blooded, smooth-faced, placid miscreant!
      Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin's gore,
    And thus for wider carnage taught to pant,
      Transferred to gorge upon a sister shore,
    The vulgarest tool that Tyranny could want,
      With just enough of talent, and no more,
    To lengthen fetters by another fixed,
    And offer poison long already mixed.

                      XIII.

    An orator of such set trash of phrase
      Ineffably--legitimately vile,
    That even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,
      Nor foes--all nations--condescend to smile,--
    Nor even a sprightly blunder's spark can blaze
      From that Ixion grindstone's ceaseless toil,
    That turns and turns to give the world a notion
    Of endless torments and perpetual motion.

                      XIV.

    A bungler even in its disgusting trade,
      And botching, patching, leaving still behind
    Something of which its masters are afraid--
      States to be curbed, and thoughts to be confined,
    Conspiracy or Congress to be made--
      Cobbling at manacles for all mankind--
    A tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,
    With God and Man's abhorrence for its gains.

                      XV.

    If we may judge of matter by the mind,
      Emasculated to the marrow It
    Hath but two objects, how to serve, and bind,
      Deeming the chain it wears even men may fit,
    Eutropius of its many masters,--blind
      To worth as freedom, wisdom as to wit,
    Fearless--because no feeling dwells in ice,
    Its very courage stagnates to a vice.

                      XVI.

    Where shall I turn me not to view its bonds,
      For I will never feel them?--Italy!
    Thy late reviving Roman soul desponds
      Beneath the lie this State-thing breathed o'er thee--
    Thy clanking chain, and Erin's yet green wounds,
      Have voices--tongues to cry aloud for me.
    Europe has slaves--allies--kings--armies still--
    And Southey lives to sing them very ill.

                      XVII.

    Meantime, Sir Laureate, I proceed to dedicate,
      In honest simple verse, this song to you.
    And, if in flattering strains I do not predicate,
      'T is that I still retain my "buff and blue;"
    My politics as yet are all to educate:
      Apostasy's so fashionable, too,
    To keep one creed's a task grown quite Herculean;
    Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?

                   DON JUAN

              CANTO THE FIRST.

                      I.

    I WANT a hero: an uncommon want,
      When every year and month sends forth a new one,
    Till, after cloying the gazettes with cant,
      The age discovers he is not the true one;
    Of such as these I should not care to vaunt,
      I'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan--
    We all have seen him, in the pantomime,
    Sent to the Devil somewhat ere his time.

                      II.

    Vernon, the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,
      Prince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,
    Evil and good, have had their tithe of talk,
      And filled their sign-posts then, like Wellesley now;
    Each in their turn like Banquo's monarchs stalk,
      Followers of Fame, "nine farrow" of that sow:
    France, too, had Buonaparte and Dumourier
    Recorded in the Moniteur and Courier.

                      III.

    Barnave, Brissot, Condorcet, Mirabeau,
      Petion, Clootz, Danton, Marat, La Fayette
    Were French, and famous people, as we know;
      And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,
    Joubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,
      With many of the military set,
    Exceedingly remarkable at times,
    But not at all adapted to my rhymes.

                      IV.

    Nelson was once Britannia's god of War,
      And still should be so, but the tide is turned;
    There's no more to be said of Trafalgar,
      'T is with our hero quietly inurned;
    Because the army's grown more popular,
      At which the naval people are concerned;
    Besides, the Prince is all for the land-service.
    Forgetting Duncan, Nelson, Howe, and Jervis.

                      V.

    Brave men were living before Agamemnon
      And since, exceeding valorous and sage,
    A good deal like him too, though quite the same none;
      But then they shone not on the poet's page,
    And so have been forgotten:--I condemn none,
      But can't find any in the present age
    Fit for my poem (that is, for my new one);
    So, as I said, I'll take my friend Don Juan.

                      VI.

    Most epic poets plunge "in medias res"
      (Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),
    And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,
      What went before--by way of episode,
    While seated after dinner at his ease,
      Beside his mistress in some soft abode,
    Palace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,
    Which serves the happy couple for a tavern.

                      VII.

    That is the usual method, but not mine--
      My way is to begin with the beginning;
    The regularity of my design
      Forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,
    And therefore I shall open with a line
      (Although it cost me half an hour in spinning),
    Narrating somewhat of Don Juan's father,
    And also of his mother, if you'd rather.

                      VIII.

    In Seville was he born, a pleasant city,
      Famous for oranges and women,--he
    Who has not seen it will be much to pity,
      So says the proverb--and I quite agree;
    Of all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,
      Cadiz perhaps--but that you soon may see;--
    Don Juan's parents lived beside the river,
    A noble stream, and called the Guadalquivir.

                      IX.

    His father's name was Jose-Don, of course,--
      A true Hidalgo, free from every stain
    Of Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source
      Through the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;
    A better cavalier ne'er mounted horse,
      Or, being mounted, e'er got down again,
    Than Jose, who begot our hero, who
    Begot--but that's to come----Well, to renew:

                      X.

    His mother was a learned lady, famed
      For every branch of every science known--
    In every Christian language ever named,
      With virtues equalled by her wit alone:
    She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,
      And even the good with inward envy groan,
    Finding themselves so very much exceeded,
    In their own way, by all the things that she did.

                      XI.

    Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart
      All Calderon and greater part of Lope;
    So, that if any actor missed his part,
      She could have served him for the prompter's copy;
    For her Feinagle's were an useless art,
      And he himself obliged to shut up shop--he
    Could never make a memory so fine as
    That which adorned the brain of Donna Inez.

                      XII.

    Her favourite science was the mathematical,
      Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,
    Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,
      Her serious sayings darkened to sublimity;
    In short, in all things she was fairly what I call
      A prodigy--her morning dress was dimity,
    Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,
    And other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.

                      XIII.

    She knew the Latin--that is, "the Lord's prayer,"
      And Greek--the alphabet--I'm nearly sure;
    She read some French romances here and there,
      Although her mode of speaking was not pure;
    For native Spanish she had no great care,
      At least her conversation was obscure;
    Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,
    As if she deemed that mystery would ennoble 'em.

                      XIV.

    She liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,
      And said there was analogy between 'em;
    She proved it somehow out of sacred song,
      But I must leave the proofs to those who've seen 'em;
    But this I heard her say, and can't be wrong,
      And all may think which way their judgments lean 'em,
    "'T is strange--the Hebrew noun which means 'I am,'
    The English always use to govern d--n."

                      XV.

    Some women use their tongues--she looked a lecture,
      Each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,
    An all-in-all sufficient self-director,
      Like the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,
    The Law's expounder, and the State's corrector,
      Whose suicide was almost an anomaly--
    One sad example more, that "All is vanity,"--
    (The jury brought their verdict in "Insanity!")

                      XVI.

    In short, she was a walking calculation,
      Miss Edgeworth's novels stepping from their covers,
    Or Mrs. Trimmer's books on education,
      Or "Coelebs' Wife" set out in quest of lovers,
    Morality's prim personification,
      In which not Envy's self a flaw discovers;
    To others' share let "female errors fall,"
    For she had not even one--the worst of all.

                      XVII.

    Oh! she was perfect past all parallel--
      Of any modern female saint's comparison;
    So far above the cunning powers of Hell,
      Her Guardian Angel had given up his garrison;
    Even her minutest motions went as well
      As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:
    In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,
    Save thine "incomparable oil," Macassar!

                      XVIII.

    Perfect she was, but as perfection is
      Insipid in this naughty world of ours,
    Where our first parents never learned to kiss
      Till they were exiled from their earlier bowers,
    Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss,
      (I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),
    Don Jose, like a lineal son of Eve,
    Went plucking various fruit without her leave.

                      XIX.

    He was a mortal of the careless kind,
      With no great love for learning, or the learned,
    Who chose to go where'er he had a mind,
      And never dreamed his lady was concerned;
    The world, as usual, wickedly inclined
      To see a kingdom or a house o'erturned,
    Whispered he had a mistress, some said two.
    But for domestic quarrels one will do.

                      XX.

    Now Donna Inez had, with all her merit,
      A great opinion of her own good qualities;
    Neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,
      And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;
    But then she had a devil of a spirit,
      And sometimes mixed up fancies with realities,
    And let few opportunities escape
    Of getting her liege lord into a scrape.

                      XXI.

    This was an easy matter with a man
      Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;
    And even the wisest, do the best they can,
      Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,
    That you might "brain them with their lady's fan;"
      And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,
    And fans turn into falchions in fair hands,
    And why and wherefore no one understands.

                      XXII.

    'T is pity learned virgins ever wed
      With persons of no sort of education,
    Or gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,
      Grow tired of scientific conversation:
    I don't choose to say much upon this head,
      I'm a plain man, and in a single station,
    But--Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,
    Inform us truly, have they not hen-pecked you all?

                      XXIII.

    Don Jose and his lady quarrelled--why,
      Not any of the many could divine,
    Though several thousand people chose to try,
     'T was surely no concern of theirs nor mine;
    I loathe that low vice--curiosity;
      But if there's anything in which I shine,
    'T is in arranging all my friends' affairs,
    Not having, of my own, domestic cares.

                      XXIV.

    And so I interfered, and with the best
      Intentions, but their treatment was not kind;
    I think the foolish people were possessed,
      For neither of them could I ever find,
    Although their porter afterwards confessed--
      But that's no matter, and the worst's behind,
    For little Juan o'er me threw, down stairs,
    A pail of housemaid's water unawares.

                      XXV.

    A little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,
      And mischief-making monkey from his birth;
    His parents ne'er agreed except in doting
      Upon the most unquiet imp on earth;
    Instead of quarrelling, had they been but both in
      Their senses, they'd have sent young master forth
    To school, or had him soundly whipped at home,
    To teach him manners for the time to come.

                      XXVI.

    Don Jose and the Donna Inez led
      For some time an unhappy sort of life,
    Wishing each other, not divorced, but dead;
      They lived respectably as man and wife,
    Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,
      And gave no outward signs of inward strife,
    Until at length the smothered fire broke out,
    And put the business past all kind of doubt.

                      XXVII.

    For Inez called some druggists and physicians,
      And tried to prove her loving lord was mad,
    But as he had some lucid intermissions,
      She next decided he was only bad;
    Yet when they asked her for her depositions,
      No sort of explanation could be had,
    Save that her duty both to man and God
    Required this conduct--which seemed very odd.

                      XXVIII.

    She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,
      And opened certain trunks of books and letters,
    All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;
      And then she had all Seville for abettors,
    Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);
      The hearers of her case became repeaters,
    Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,
    Some for amusement, others for old grudges.

                      XXIX.

    And then this best and meekest woman bore
      With such serenity her husband's woes,
    Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,
      Who saw their spouses killed, and nobly chose
    Never to say a word about them more--
      Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,
    And saw his agonies with such sublimity,
    That all the world exclaimed, "What magnanimity!"

                      XXX.

    No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,
      Is philosophic in our former friends;
    'T is also pleasant to be deemed magnanimous,
      The more so in obtaining our own ends;
    And what the lawyers call a "malus animus"
      Conduct like this by no means comprehends:
    Revenge in person's certainly no virtue,
    But then 't is not my fault, if others hurt you.

                      XXXI.

    And if our quarrels should rip up old stories,
      And help them with a lie or two additional,
    I'm not to blame, as you well know--no more is
      Any one else--they were become traditional;
    Besides, their resurrection aids our glories
      By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:
    And Science profits by this resurrection--
    Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.

                      XXXII.

    Their friends had tried at reconciliation,
      Then their relations, who made matters worse.
    ('T were hard to tell upon a like occasion
      To whom it may be best to have recourse--
    I can't say much for friend or yet relation)
      The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,
    But scarce a fee was paid on either side
    Before, unluckily, Don Jose died.

                      XXXIII.

    He died: and most unluckily, because,
      According to all hints I could collect
    From Counsel learned in those kinds of laws,
      (Although their talk's obscure and circumspect)
    His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;
      A thousand pities also with respect
    To public feeling, which on this occasion
    Was manifested in a great sensation.

                      XXXIV.

    But ah! he died; and buried with him lay
      The public feeling and the lawyers' fees:
    His house was sold, his servants sent away,
      A Jew took one of his two mistresses,
    A priest the other--at least so they say:
      I asked the doctors after his disease--
    He died of the slow fever called the tertian,
    And left his widow to her own aversion.

                      XXXV.

    Yet Jose was an honourable man,
      That I must say, who knew him very well;
    Therefore his frailties I'll no further scan,
      Indeed there were not many more to tell:
    And if his passions now and then outran
      Discretion, and were not so peaceable
    As Numa's (who was also named Pompilius),
    He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.

                      XXXVI.

    Whate'er might be his worthlessness or worth,
      Poor fellow! he had many things to wound him.
    Let's own--since it can do no good on earth--
      It was a trying moment that which found him
    Standing alone beside his desolate hearth,
      Where all his household gods lay shivered round him:
    No choice was left his feelings or his pride,
    Save Death or Doctors' Commons--so he died.

                      XXXVII.

    Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir
      To a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands,
    Which, with a long minority and care,
      Promised to turn out well in proper hands:
    Inez became sole guardian, which was fair,
      And answered but to Nature's just demands;
    An only son left with an only mother
    Is brought up much more wisely than another.

                      XXXVIII.

    Sagest of women, even of widows, she
      Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,
    And worthy of the noblest pedigree,
      (His Sire was of Castile, his Dam from Aragon)
    Then, for accomplishments of chivalry,
      In case our Lord the King should go to war again,
    He learned the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,
    And how to scale a fortress--or a nunnery.

                      XXXIX.

    But that which Donna Inez most desired,
      And saw into herself each day before all
    The learned tutors whom for him she hired,
      Was, that his breeding should be strictly moral:
    Much into all his studies she inquired,
      And so they were submitted first to her, all,
    Arts, sciences--no branch was made a mystery
    To Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.

                      XL.

    The languages, especially the dead,
      The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,
    The arts, at least all such as could be said
      To be the most remote from common use,
    In all these he was much and deeply read:
      But not a page of anything that's loose,
    Or hints continuation of the species,
    Was ever suffered, lest he should grow vicious.

                      XLI.

    His classic studies made a little puzzle,
      Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,
    Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,
      But never put on pantaloons or bodices;
    His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,
      And for their Aeneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,
    Were forced to make an odd sort of apology,
    For Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.

                      XLII.

    Ovid's a rake, as half his verses show him,
      Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,
    Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,
      I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,
    Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn
      Where the Sublime soars forth on wings more ample;
    But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one
    Beginning with "Formosum Pastor Corydon."

                      XLIII.

    Lucretius' irreligion is too strong
      For early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;
    I can't help thinking Juvenal was wrong,
      Although no doubt his real intent was good,
    For speaking out so plainly in his song,
      So much indeed as to be downright rude;
    And then what proper person can be partial
    To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?

                      XLIV.

    Juan was taught from out the best edition,
      Expurgated by learned men, who place,
    Judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision,
      The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface
    Too much their modest bard by this omission,
      And pitying sore his mutilated case,
    They only add them all in an appendix,
    Which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;

                      XLV.

    For there we have them all "at one fell swoop,"
      Instead of being scattered through the pages;
    They stand forth marshalled in a handsome troop,
      To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,
    Till some less rigid editor shall stoop
      To call them back into their separate cages,
    Instead of standing staring all together,
    Like garden gods--and not so decent either.

                      XLVI.

    The Missal too (it was the family Missal)
      Was ornamented in a sort of way
    Which ancient mass-books often are, and this all
      Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,
    Who saw those figures on the margin kiss all,
      Could turn their optics to the text and pray,
    Is more than I know--But Don Juan's mother
    Kept this herself, and gave her son another.

                      XLVII.

    Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,
      And homilies, and lives of all the saints;
    To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,
      He did not take such studies for restraints;
    But how Faith is acquired, and then insured,
      So well not one of the aforesaid paints
    As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,
    Which make the reader envy his transgressions.

                      XLVIII.

    This, too, was a sealed book to little Juan--
      I can't but say that his mamma was right,
    If such an education was the true one.
      She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;
    Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,
      You might be sure she was a perfect fright;
    She did this during even her husband's life--
    I recommend as much to every wife.

                      XLIX.

    Young Juan waxed in goodliness and grace;
      At six a charming child, and at eleven
    With all the promise of as fine a face
      As e'er to Man's maturer growth was given:
    He studied steadily, and grew apace,
      And seemed, at least, in the right road to Heaven,
    For half his days were passed at church, the other
    Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.

                      L.

    At six, I said, he was a charming child,
      At twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;
    Although in infancy a little wild,
      They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy
    His natural spirit not in vain they toiled,
      At least it seemed so; and his mother's joy
    Was to declare how sage, and still, and steady,
    Her young philosopher was grown already.

                      LI.

    I had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,
     But what I say is neither here nor there:
    I knew his father well, and have some skill
      In character--but it would not be fair
    From sire to son to augur good or ill:
      He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair--
    But scandal's my aversion--I protest
    Against all evil speaking, even in jest.

                      LII.

    For my part I say nothing--nothing--but
      This I will say--my reasons are my own--
    That if I had an only son to put
      To school (as God be praised that I have none),
    'T is not with Donna Inez I would shut
      Him up to learn his catechism alone,
    No--no--I'd send him out betimes to college,
    For there it was I picked up my own knowledge.

                      LIII.

    For there one learns--'t is not for me to boast,
      Though I acquired--but I pass over that,
    As well as all the Greek I since have lost:
      I say that there's the place--but "Verbum sat,"
    I think I picked up too, as well as most,
      Knowledge of matters--but no matter what--
    I never married--but, I think, I know
    That sons should not be educated so.

                      LIV.

    Young Juan now was sixteen years of age,
      Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seemed
    Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;
      And everybody but his mother deemed
    Him almost man; but she flew in a rage
      And bit her lips (for else she might have screamed)
    If any said so--for to be precocious
    Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.

                      LV.

    Amongst her numerous acquaintance, all
      Selected for discretion and devotion,
    There was the Donna Julia, whom to call
      Pretty were but to give a feeble notion
    Of many charms in her as natural
      As sweetness to the flower, or salt to Ocean,
    Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid,
    (But this last simile is trite and stupid.)

                      LVI.

    The darkness of her Oriental eye
      Accorded with her Moorish origin;
    (Her blood was not all Spanish; by the by,
      In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin;)
    When proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,
      Boabdil wept: of Donna Julia's kin
    Some went to Africa, some stayed in Spain--
    Her great great grandmamma chose to remain.

                      LVII.

    She married (I forget the pedigree)
      With an Hidalgo, who transmitted down
    His blood less noble than such blood should be;
      At such alliances his sires would frown,
    In that point so precise in each degree
      That they bred in and in, as might be shown,
    Marrying their cousins--nay, their aunts, and nieces,
    Which always spoils the breed, if it increases.

                      LVIII.

    This heathenish cross restored the breed again,
      Ruined its blood, but much improved its flesh;
    For from a root the ugliest in Old Spain
      Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;
    The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:
      But there's a rumour which I fain would hush,
    'T is said that Donna Julia's grandmamma
    Produced her Don more heirs at love than law.

                      LIX.

    However this might be, the race went on
      Improving still through every generation,
    Until it centred in an only son,
      Who left an only daughter; my narration
    May have suggested that this single one
      Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion
    I shall have much to speak about), and she
    Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.

                      LX.

    Her eye (I'm very fond of handsome eyes)
      Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire
    Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise
      Flashed an expression more of pride than ire,
    And love than either; and there would arise
      A something in them which was not desire,
    But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul
    Which struggled through and chastened down the whole.

                      LXI.

    Her glossy hair was clustered o'er a brow
      Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;
    Her eyebrow's shape was like the aerial bow,
      Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,
    Mounting, at times, to a transparent glow,
      As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,
    Possessed an air and grace by no means common:
    Her stature tall--I hate a dumpy woman.

                      LXII.

    Wedded she was some years, and to a man
      Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;
    And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE
      'T were better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,
    Especially in countries near the sun:
      And now I think on 't, "mi vien in mente",
    Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue
    Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.

                      LXIII.

    'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,
      And all the fault of that indecent sun,
    Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,
      But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,
    That howsoever people fast and pray,
      The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:
    What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,
    Is much more common where the climate's sultry,

                      LXIV.

    Happy the nations of the moral North!
      Where all is virtue, and the winter season
    Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth
      ('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);
    Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,
      By laying whate'er sum, in mulct, they please on
    The lover, who must pay a handsome price,
    Because it is a marketable vice.

                      LXV.

    Alfonso was the name of Julia's lord,
      A man well looking for his years, and who
    Was neither much beloved nor yet abhorred:
      They lived together as most people do,
    Suffering each other's foibles by accord,
      And not exactly either one or two;
    Yet he was jealous, though he did not show it,
    For Jealousy dislikes the world to know it.

                      LXVI.

    Julia was--yet I never could see why--
      With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;
    Between their tastes there was small sympathy,
      For not a line had Julia ever penned:
    Some people whisper (but, no doubt, they lie,
      For Malice still imputes some private end)
    That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso's marriage,
    Forgot with him her very prudent carriage;

                      LXVII.

    And that still keeping up the old connection,
      Which Time had lately rendered much more chaste,
    She took his lady also in affection,
      And certainly this course was much the best:
    She flattered Julia with her sage protection,
      And complimented Don Alfonso's taste;
    And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,
    At least she left it a more slender handle.

                      LXVIII.

    I can't tell whether Julia saw the affair
      With other people's eyes, or if her own
    Discoveries made, but none could be aware
      Of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown;
    Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,
      Indifferent from the first, or callous grown:
    I'm really puzzled what to think or say,
    She kept her counsel in so close a way.

                      LXIX.

    Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,
      Caressed him often--such a thing might be
    Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,
      When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;
    But I am not so sure I should have smiled
      When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;
    These few short years make wondrous alterations,
    Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.

                      LXX.

    Whate'er the cause might be, they had become
      Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,
    Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,
      And much embarrassment in either eye;
    There surely will be little doubt with some
      That Donna Julia knew the reason why,
    But as for Juan, he had no more notion
    Than he who never saw the sea of Ocean.

                      LXXI.

    Yet Julia's very coldness still was kind,
      And tremulously gentle her small hand
    Withdrew itself from his, but left behind
      A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland
    And slight, so very slight, that to the mind
      'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand
    Wrought change with all Armida's fairy art
    Like what this light touch left on Juan's heart.

                      LXXII.

    And if she met him, though she smiled no more,
      She looked a sadness sweeter than her smile,
    As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store
      She must not own, but cherished more the while
    For that compression in its burning core;
      Even Innocence itself has many a wile,
    And will not dare to trust itself with truth,
    And Love is taught hypocrisy from youth.

                      LXXIII.

    But Passion most dissembles, yet betrays
      Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky
    Foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays
      Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,
    And in whatever aspect it arrays
      Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;
    Coldness or Anger, even Disdain or Hate,
    Are masks it often wears, and still too late.

                      LXXIV.

    Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,
      And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,
    And burning blushes, though for no transgression,
      Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;
    All these are little preludes to possession,
      Of which young Passion cannot be bereft,
    And merely tend to show how greatly Love is
    Embarrassed at first starting with a novice.

                      LXXV.

    Poor Julia's heart was in an awkward state;
      She felt it going, and resolved to make
    The noblest efforts for herself and mate,
      For Honour's, Pride's, Religion's, Virtue's sake:
    Her resolutions were most truly great,
      And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:
    She prayed the Virgin Mary for her grace,
    As being the best judge of a lady's case.

                      LXXVI.

    She vowed she never would see Juan more,
      And next day paid a visit to his mother,
    And looked extremely at the opening door,
      Which, by the Virgin's grace, let in another;
    Grateful she was, and yet a little sore--
      Again it opens, it can be no other,
    'T is surely Juan now--No! I'm afraid
    That night the Virgin was no further prayed.

                      LXXVII.

    She now determined that a virtuous woman
      Should rather face and overcome temptation,
    That flight was base and dastardly, and no man
      Should ever give her heart the least sensation,
    That is to say, a thought beyond the common
      Preference, that we must feel, upon occasion,
    For people who are pleasanter than others,
    But then they only seem so many brothers.

                      LXXVIII.

    And even if by chance--and who can tell?
      The Devil's so very sly--she should discover
    That all within was not so very well,
      And, if still free, that such or such a lover
    Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell
      Such thoughts, and be the better when they're over;
    And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:
    I recommend young ladies to make trial.

                      LXXIX.

    And, then, there are such things as Love divine,
      Bright and immaculate, unmixed and pure,
    Such as the angels think so very fine,
      And matrons, who would be no less secure,
    Platonic, perfect, "just such love as mine;"
      Thus Julia said--and thought so, to be sure;
    And so I'd have her think, were I the man
    On whom her reveries celestial ran.

                      LXXX.

    Such love is innocent, and may exist
      Between young persons without any danger.
    A hand may first, and then a lip be kissed;
      For my part, to such doings I'm a stranger,
    But hear these freedoms form the utmost list
      Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:
    If people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,
    But not my fault--I tell them all in time.

                      LXXXI.

    Love, then, but Love within its proper limits,
      Was Julia's innocent determination
    In young Don Juan's favour, and to him its
      Exertion might be useful on occasion;
    And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its
      Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion
    He might be taught, by Love and her together--
    I really don't know what, nor Julia either.

                      LXXXII.

    Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced
      In mail of proof--her purity of soul--
    She, for the future, of her strength convinced,
      And that her honour was a rock, or mole,
    Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed
      With any kind of troublesome control;
    But whether Julia to the task was equal
    Is that which must be mentioned in the sequel.

                      LXXXIII.

    Her plan she deemed both innocent and feasible,
      And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen
    Not Scandal's fangs could fix on much that's seizable,
      Or if they did so, satisfied to mean
    Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable--
      A quiet conscience makes one so serene!
    Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded
    That all the Apostles would have done as they did.

                      LXXXIV.

    And if in the mean time her husband died,
      But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross
    Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sighed)
      Never could she survive that common loss;
    But just suppose that moment should betide,
      I only say suppose it--inter nos:
    (This should be entre nous, for Julia thought
    In French, but then the rhyme would go for nought.)

                      LXXXV.

    I only say, suppose this supposition:
      Juan being then grown up to man's estate
    Would fully suit a widow of condition,
      Even seven years hence it would not be too late;
    And in the interim (to pursue this vision)
      The mischief, after all, could not be great,
    For he would learn the rudiments of Love,
    I mean the seraph way of those above.

                      LXXXVI.

    So much for Julia! Now we'll turn to Juan.
      Poor little fellow! he had no idea
    Of his own case, and never hit the true one;
      In feelings quick as Ovid's Miss Medea,
    He puzzled over what he found a new one,
      But not as yet imagined it could be a
    Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,
    Which, with a little patience, might grow charming.

                      LXXXVII.

    Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,
      His home deserted for the lonely wood,
    Tormented with a wound he could not know,
      His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:
    I'm fond myself of solitude or so,
      But then, I beg it may be understood,
    By solitude I mean a Sultan's (not
    A Hermit's), with a haram for a grot.

                      LXXXVIII.

    "Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,
      Where Transport and Security entwine,
    Here is the Empire of thy perfect bliss,
      And here thou art a God indeed divine."
    The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,
      With the exception of the second line,
    For that same twining "Transport and Security"
    Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.

                      LXXXIX.

    The Poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals
      To the good sense and senses of mankind,
    The very thing which everybody feels,
      As all have found on trial, or may find,
    That no one likes to be disturbed at meals
      Or love.--I won't say more about "entwined"
    Or "Transport," as we knew all that before,
    But beg "Security" will bolt the door.

                      XC.

    Young Juan wandered by the glassy brooks,
      Thinking unutterable things; he threw
    Himself at length within the leafy nooks
      Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;
    There poets find materials for their books,
      And every now and then we read them through,
    So that their plan and prosody are eligible,
    Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.

                      XCI.

    He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued
      His self-communion with his own high soul,
    Until his mighty heart, in its great mood,
      Had mitigated part, though not the whole
    Of its disease; he did the best he could
      With things not very subject to control,
    And turned, without perceiving his condition,
    Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.

                      XCII.

    He thought about himself, and the whole earth,
      Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,
    And how the deuce they ever could have birth:
      And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,
    How many miles the moon might have in girth,
      Of air-balloons, and of the many bars
    To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;--
    And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.

                      XCIII.

    In thoughts like these true Wisdom may discern
      Longings sublime, and aspirations high,
    Which some are born with, but the most part learn
      To plague themselves withal, they know not why:
    'T was strange that one so young should thus concern
      His brain about the action of the sky;
    If you think 't was Philosophy that this did,
    I can't help thinking puberty assisted.

                      XCIV.

    He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,
      And heard a voice in all the winds; and then
    He thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,
      And how the goddesses came down to men:
    He missed the pathway, he forgot the hours,
      And when he looked upon his watch again,
    He found how much old Time had been a winner--
    He also found that he had lost his dinner.

                      XCV.

    Sometimes he turned to gaze upon his book,
      Boscan, or Garcilasso;--by the wind
    Even as the page is rustled while we look,
      So by the poesy of his own mind
    Over the mystic leaf his soul was shook,
      As if 't were one whereon magicians bind
    Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,
    According to some good old woman's tale.

                      XCVI.

    Thus would he while his lonely hours away
      Dissatisfied, not knowing what he wanted;
    Nor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay,
      Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,
    A bosom whereon he his head might lay,
      And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,
    With----several other things, which I forget,
    Or which, at least, I need not mention yet.

                      XCVII.

    Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,
      Could not escape the gentle Julia's eyes;
    She saw that Juan was not at his ease;
      But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,
    Is, that the Donna Inez did not tease
      Her only son with question or surmise;
    Whether it was she did not see, or would not,
    Or, like all very clever people, could not.

                      XCVIII.

    This may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;
      For instance--gentlemen, whose ladies take
    Leave to o'erstep the written rights of Woman,
      And break the----Which commandment is 't they break?
    (I have forgot the number, and think no man
      Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake;)
    I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,
    They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.

                      XCIX.

    A real husband always is suspicious,
      But still no less suspects in the wrong place,
    Jealous of some one who had no such wishes,
      Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace,
    By harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;
      The last indeed's infallibly the case:
    And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,
    He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.

                      C.

    Thus parents also are at times short-sighted:
      Though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover,
    The while the wicked world beholds delighted,
      Young Hopeful's mistress, or Miss Fanny's lover,
    Till some confounded escapade has blighted
      The plan of twenty years, and all is over;
    And then the mother cries, the father swears,
    And wonders why the devil he got heirs.

                      CI.

    But Inez was so anxious, and so clear
      Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,
    She had some other motive much more near
      For leaving Juan to this new temptation,
    But what that motive was, I sha'n't say here;
      Perhaps to finish Juan's education,
    Perhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,
    In case he thought his wife too great a prize.

                      CII.

    It was upon a day, a summer's day;--
      Summer's indeed a very dangerous season,
    And so is spring about the end of May;
      The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;
    But whatsoe'er the cause is, one may say,
      And stand convicted of more truth than treason,
    That there are months which nature grows more merry in,--
    March has its hares, and May must have its heroine.

                      CIII.

    'T was on a summer's day--the sixth of June:
      I like to be particular in dates,
    Not only of the age, and year, but moon;
      They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates
    Change horses, making History change its tune,
      Then spur away o'er empires and o'er states,
    Leaving at last not much besides chronology,
    Excepting the post-obits of theology.

                      CIV.

    'T was on the sixth of June, about the hour
      Of half-past six--perhaps still nearer seven--
    When Julia sate within as pretty a bower
      As e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven
    Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,
      To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,
    With all the trophies of triumphant song--
    He won them well, and may he wear them long!

                      CV.

    She sate, but not alone; I know not well
      How this same interview had taken place,
    And even if I knew, I should not tell--
      People should hold their tongues in any case;
    No matter how or why the thing befell,
      But there were she and Juan, face to face--
    When two such faces are so, 't would be wise,
    But very difficult, to shut their eyes.

                      CVI.

    How beautiful she looked! her conscious heart
      Glowed in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong:
    Oh Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,
      Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong!
    How self-deceitful is the sagest part
      Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along!--
    The precipice she stood on was immense,
    So was her creed in her own innocence.

                      CVII.

    She thought of her own strength, and Juan's youth,
      And of the folly of all prudish fears,
    Victorious Virtue, and domestic Truth,
      And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:
    I wish these last had not occurred, in sooth,
      Because that number rarely much endears,
    And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,
    Sounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money.

                      CVIII.

    When people say, "I've told you fifty times,"
      They mean to scold, and very often do;
    When poets say, "I've written fifty rhymes,"
      They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;
    In gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;
      At fifty love for love is rare, 't is true,
    But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,
    A good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.

                      CIX.

    Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love
      For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,
    By all the vows below to Powers above,
      She never would disgrace the ring she wore,
    Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;
      And while she pondered this, besides much more,
    One hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,
    Quite by mistake--she thought it was her own;

                      CX.

    Unconsciously she leaned upon the other,
      Which played within the tangles of her hair;
    And to contend with thoughts she could not smother
      She seemed by the distraction of her air.
    'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother
      To leave together this imprudent pair,
    She who for many years had watched her son so--
    I'm very certain mine would not have done so.

                      CXI.

    The hand which still held Juan's, by degrees
      Gently, but palpably confirmed its grasp,
    As if it said, "Detain me, if you please;"
      Yet there's no doubt she only meant to clasp
    His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze;
      She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,
    Had she imagined such a thing could rouse
    A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.

                      CXII.

    I cannot know what Juan thought of this,
      But what he did, is much what you would do;
    His young lip thanked it with a grateful kiss,
      And then, abashed at its own joy, withdrew
    In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,--
      Love is so very timid when 't is new:
    She blushed, and frowned not, but she strove to speak,
    And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.

                      CXIII.

    The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:
      The Devil's in the moon for mischief; they
    Who called her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon
      Their nomenclature; there is not a day,
    The longest, not the twenty-first of June,
      Sees half the business in a wicked way,
    On which three single hours of moonshine smile--
    And then she looks so modest all the while!

                      CXIV.

    There is a dangerous silence in that hour,
      A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul
    To open all itself, without the power
      Of calling wholly back its self-control;
    The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,
      Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,
    Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws
    A loving languor, which is not repose.

                      CXV.

    And Julia sate with Juan, half embraced
      And half retiring from the glowing arm,
    Which trembled like the bosom where 't was placed;
      Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,
    Or else 't were easy to withdraw her waist;
      But then the situation had its charm,
    And then--God knows what next--I can't go on;
    I'm almost sorry that I e'er begun.

                      CXVI.

    Oh Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,
      With your confounded fantasies, to more
    Immoral conduct by the fancied sway
      Your system feigns o'er the controlless core
    Of human hearts, than all the long array
      Of poets and romancers:--You're a bore,
    A charlatan, a coxcomb--and have been,
    At best, no better than a go-between.

                      CXVII.

    And Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,
      Until too late for useful conversation;
    The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,
      I wish, indeed, they had not had occasion;
    But who, alas! can love, and then be wise?
      Not that Remorse did not oppose Temptation;
    A little still she strove, and much repented,
    And whispering "I will ne'er consent"--consented.

                      CXVIII.

    'T is said that Xerxes offered a reward
      To those who could invent him a new pleasure:
    Methinks the requisition's rather hard,
      And must have cost his Majesty a treasure:
    For my part, I'm a moderate-minded bard,
      Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);
    I care not for new pleasures, as the old
    Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.

                      CXIX.

    Oh Pleasure! you're indeed a pleasant thing,
      Although one must be damned for you, no doubt:
    I make a resolution every spring
      Of reformation, ere the year run out,
    But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,
      Yet still, I trust, it may be kept throughout:
    I'm very sorry, very much ashamed,
    And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaimed.

                      CXX.

    Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take--
      Start not! still chaster reader--she'll be nice hence-
    Forward, and there is no great cause to quake;
      This liberty is a poetic licence,
    Which some irregularity may make
      In the design, and as I have a high sense
    Of Aristotle and the Rules, 't is fit
    To beg his pardon when I err a bit.

                      CXXI.

    This licence is to hope the reader will
      Suppose from June the sixth (the fatal day,
    Without whose epoch my poetic skill
      For want of facts would all be thrown away),
    But keeping Julia and Don Juan still
      In sight, that several months have passed; we'll say
    'T was in November, but I'm not so sure
    About the day--the era's more obscure.

                      CXXII.

    We'll talk of that anon.--'T is sweet to hear
      At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep
    The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,
      By distance mellowed, o'er the waters sweep;
    'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;
      'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep
    From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high
    The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.

                      CXXIII.

    'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark
      Bay deep-mouthed welcome as we draw near home;
    'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark
      Our coming, and look brighter when we come;
    'T is sweet to be awakened by the lark,
      Or lulled by falling waters; sweet the hum
    Of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,
    The lisp of children, and their earliest words.

                      CXXIV.

    Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes
      In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,
    Purple and gushing: sweet are our escapes
      From civic revelry to rural mirth;
    Sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,
      Sweet to the father is his first-born's birth,
    Sweet is revenge--especially to women--
    Pillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.

                      CXXV.

    Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet
      The unexpected death of some old lady,
    Or gentleman of seventy years complete,
      Who've made "us youth" wait too--too long already,
    For an estate, or cash, or country seat,
      Still breaking, but with stamina so steady,
    That all the Israelites are fit to mob its
    Next owner for their double-damned post-obits.

                      CXXVI.

    'T is sweet to win, no matter how, one's laurels,
      By blood or ink; 't is sweet to put an end
    To strife; 't is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels,
      Particularly with a tiresome friend:
    Sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;
      Dear is the helpless creature we defend
    Against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot
    We ne'er forget, though there we are forgot.

                      CXXVII.

    But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,
      Is first and passionate Love--it stands alone,
    Like Adam's recollection of his fall;
      The Tree of Knowledge has been plucked--all 's known--
    And Life yields nothing further to recall
      Worthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown,
    No doubt in fable, as the unforgiven
    Fire which Prometheus filched for us from Heaven.

                      CXXVIII.

    Man's a strange animal, and makes strange use
      Of his own nature, and the various arts,
    And likes particularly to produce
      Some new experiment to show his parts;
    This is the age of oddities let loose,
      Where different talents find their different marts;
    You'd best begin with truth, and when you've lost your
    Labour, there's a sure market for imposture.

                      CXXIX.

    What opposite discoveries we have seen!
      (Signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.)
    One makes new noses, one a guillotine,
      One breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;
    But Vaccination certainly has been
      A kind antithesis to Congreve's rockets,
    With which the Doctor paid off an old pox,
    By borrowing a new one from an ox.

    Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes:

      What wondrous new machines have late been spinning!
    I said the small-pox has gone out of late;
    Perhaps it may be followed by the great.

    'T is said the great came from America;
      Perhaps it may set out on its return,--
    The population there so spreads, they say
      'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,
    With war, or plague, or famine--any way,
      So that civilisation they may learn;
    And which in ravage the more loathsome evil is--
    Their real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?

    This is the patent age of new inventions
      For killing bodies, and for saving souls,
    All propagated with the best intentions:
      Sir Humphry Davy's lantern, by which coals

      Tombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles
    Are ways to benefit mankind, as true,
    Perhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.

    Man's a phenomenon, one knows not what,
      And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;
    'T is pity though, in this sublime world, that
      Pleasure's a sin, and sometimes Sin's a pleasure;
    Few mortals know what end they would be at,
      But whether Glory, Power, or Love, or Treasure,
    The path is through perplexing ways, and when
    The goal is gained, we die, you know--and then----

                      CXXXIV.

    What then?--I do not know, no more do you--
      And so good night.--Return we to our story:
    'T was in November, when fine days are few,
      And the far mountains wax a little hoary,
    And clap a white cape on their mantles blue;
      And the sea dashes round the promontory,
    And the loud breaker boils against the rock,
    And sober suns must set at five o'clock.

                      CXXXV.

    'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;
      No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud
    By gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright
      With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;
    There's something cheerful in that sort of light,
      Even as a summer sky's without a cloud:
    I'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,
    A lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.

                      CXXXVI.

    'T was midnight--Donna Julia was in bed,
      Sleeping, most probably,--when at her door
    Arose a clatter might awake the dead,
      If they had never been awoke before,
    And that they have been so we all have read,
      And are to be so, at the least, once more;--
    The door was fastened, but with voice and fist
    First knocks were heard, then "Madam--Madam--hist!

                      CXXXVII.

    "For God's sake, Madam--Madam--here's my master,
      With more than half the city at his back--Was
    ever heard of such a curst disaster!
      'T is not my fault--I kept good watch--Alack!
    Do pray undo the bolt a little faster--
      They're on the stair just now, and in a crack
    Will all be here; perhaps he yet may fly--
    Surely the window's not so very high!"

                      CXXXVIII.

    By this time Don Alfonso was arrived,
      With torches, friends, and servants in great number;
    The major part of them had long been wived,
      And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber
    Of any wicked woman, who contrived
      By stealth her husband's temples to encumber:
    Examples of this kind are so contagious,
    Were one not punished, all would be outrageous.

                      CXXXIX.

    I can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion
      Could enter into Don Alfonso's head;
    But for a cavalier of his condition
      It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,
    Without a word of previous admonition,
      To hold a levee round his lady's bed,
    And summon lackeys, armed with fire and sword,
    To prove himself the thing he most abhorred.

                      CXL.

    Poor Donna Julia! starting as from sleep,
      (Mind--that I do not say--she had not slept),
    Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;
      Her maid, Antonia, who was an adept,
    Contrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,
      As if she had just now from out them crept:
    I can't tell why she should take all this trouble
    To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.

                      CXLI.

    But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,
      Appeared like two poor harmless women, who
    Of goblins, but still more of men afraid,
      Had thought one man might be deterred by two,
    And therefore side by side were gently laid,
      Until the hours of absence should run through,
    And truant husband should return, and say,
    "My dear,--I was the first who came away."

                      CXLII.

    Now Julia found at length a voice, and cried,
      "In Heaven's name, Don Alfonso, what d' ye mean?
    Has madness seized you? would that I had died
      Ere such a monster's victim I had been!
    What may this midnight violence betide,
      A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?
    Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?
    Search, then, the room!"--Alfonso said, "I will."

                      CXLIII.

    He searched, they searched, and rummaged everywhere,
      Closet and clothes' press, chest and window-seat,
    And found much linen, lace, and several pair
      Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,
    With other articles of ladies fair,
      To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:
    Arras they pricked and curtains with their swords,
    And wounded several shutters, and some boards.

                      CXLIV.

    Under the bed they searched, and there they found--
      No matter what--it was not that they sought;
    They opened windows, gazing if the ground
      Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;
    And then they stared each others' faces round:
      'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,
    And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,
    Of looking in the bed as well as under.

                      CXLV.

    During this inquisition Julia's tongue
      Was not asleep--"Yes, search and search," she cried,
    "Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!
      It was for this that I became a bride!
    For this in silence I have suffered long
      A husband like Alfonso at my side;
    But now I'll bear no more, nor here remain,
    If there be law or lawyers in all Spain.

                      CXLVI.

    "Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,
      If ever you indeed deserved the name,
    Is 't worthy of your years?--you have threescore--
      Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same--
    Is 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore
      For facts against a virtuous woman's fame?
    Ungrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,
    How dare you think your lady would go on so?

                      CXLVII.

    "Is it for this I have disdained to hold
      The common privileges of my sex?
    That I have chosen a confessor so old
      And deaf, that any other it would vex,
    And never once he has had cause to scold,
      But found my very innocence perplex
    So much, he always doubted I was married--
    How sorry you will be when I've miscarried!

                      CXLVIII.

    "Was it for this that no Cortejo e'er
      I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?
    Is it for this I scarce went anywhere,
      Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?
    Is it for this, whate'er my suitors were,
      I favoured none--nay, was almost uncivil?
    Is it for this that General Count O'Reilly,
    Who took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?

                      CXLIX.

    "Did not the Italian Musico Cazzani
      Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?
    Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,
      Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?
    Were there not also Russians, English, many?
      The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,
    And Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,
    Who killed himself for love (with wine) last year.

                      CL.

    "Have I not had two bishops at my feet?
      The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez;
    And is it thus a faithful wife you treat?
      I wonder in what quarter now the moon is:
    I praise your vast forbearance not to beat
      Me also, since the time so opportune is--
    Oh, valiant man! with sword drawn and cocked trigger,
    Now, tell me, don't you cut a pretty figure?

                      CLI.

    "Was it for this you took your sudden journey,
      Under pretence of business indispensable
    With that sublime of rascals your attorney,
      Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible
    Of having played the fool? though both I spurn, he
      Deserves the worst, his conduct's less defensible,
    Because, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee,
    And not from any love to you nor me.

                      CLII.

    "If he comes here to take a deposition,
      By all means let the gentleman proceed;
    You've made the apartment in a fit condition:--
      There's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need--
    Let everything be noted with precision,
      I would not you for nothing should be fee'd--
    But, as my maid's undressed, pray turn your spies out."
    "Oh!" sobbed Antonia, "I could tear their eyes out."

                      CLIII.

    "There is the closet, there the toilet, there
      The antechamber--search them under, over;
    There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,
      The chimney--which would really hold a lover.
    I wish to sleep, and beg you will take care
      And make no further noise, till you discover
    The secret cavern of this lurking treasure--
    And when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.

                      CLIV.

    "And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown
      Doubt upon me, confusion over all,
    Pray have the courtesy to make it known
      Who is the man you search for? how d' ye call
    Him? what's his lineage? let him but be shown--
      I hope he's young and handsome--is he tall?
    Tell me--and be assured, that since you stain
    My honour thus, it shall not be in vain.

                      CLV.

    "At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,
      At that age he would be too old for slaughter,
    Or for so young a husband's jealous fears--
      (Antonia! let me have a glass of water.)
    I am ashamed of having shed these tears,
      They are unworthy of my father's daughter;
    My mother dreamed not in my natal hour,
    That I should fall into a monster's power.

                      CLVI.

    "Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,
      You saw that she was sleeping by my side,
    When you broke in upon us with your fellows:
      Look where you please--we've nothing, sir, to hide;
    Only another time, I trust, you'll tell us,
      Or for the sake of decency abide
    A moment at the door, that we may be
    Dressed to receive so much good company.

                      CLVII.

    "And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;
      The little I have said may serve to show
    The guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er
      The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:--
    I leave you to your conscience as before,
      'T will one day ask you why you used me so?
    God grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!--
    Antonia! where's my pocket-handkerchief?"

                      CLVIII.

    She ceased, and turned upon her pillow; pale
      She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,
    Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,
      Waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears
    Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail
      To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears
    Its snow through all;--her soft lips lie apart,
    And louder than her breathing beats her heart.

                      CLIX.

    The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;
      Antonia bustled round the ransacked room,
    And, turning up her nose, with looks abused
      Her master, and his myrmidons, of whom
    Not one, except the attorney, was amused;
      He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,
    So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,
    Knowing they must be settled by the laws.

                      CLX.

    With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,
      Following Antonia's motions here and there,
    With much suspicion in his attitude;
      For reputations he had little care;
    So that a suit or action were made good,
      Small pity had he for the young and fair,
    And ne'er believed in negatives, till these
    Were proved by competent false witnesses.

                      CLXI.

    But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,
      And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;
    When, after searching in five hundred nooks,
      And treating a young wife with so much rigour,
    He gained no point, except some self-rebukes,
      Added to those his lady with such vigour
    Had poured upon him for the last half-hour,
    Quick, thick, and heavy--as a thunder-shower.

                      CLXII.

    At first he tried to hammer an excuse,
      To which the sole reply was tears, and sobs,
    And indications of hysterics, whose
      Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,
    Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose:
      Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;
    He saw too, in perspective, her relations,
    And then he tried to muster all his patience.

                      CLXIII.

    He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,
      But sage Antonia cut him short before
    The anvil of his speech received the hammer,
      With "Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,
    Or madam dies."--Alfonso muttered, "D--n her,"
      But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;
    He cast a rueful look or two, and did,
    He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.

                      CLXIV.

    With him retired his "posse comitatus,"
      The attorney last, who lingered near the door
    Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as
      Antonia let him--not a little sore
    At this most strange and unexplained "hiatus"
      In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore
    An awkward look; as he revolved the case,
    The door was fastened in his legal face.

                      CLXV.

    No sooner was it bolted, than--Oh Shame!
      Oh Sin! Oh Sorrow! and Oh Womankind!
    How can you do such things and keep your fame,
      Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?
    Nothing so dear as an unfilched good name!
      But to proceed--for there is more behind:
    With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,
    Young Juan slipped, half-smothered, from the bed.

                      CLXVI.

    He had been hid--I don't pretend to say
      How, nor can I indeed describe the where--
    Young, slender, and packed easily, he lay,
      No doubt, in little compass, round or square;
    But pity him I neither must nor may
      His suffocation by that pretty pair;
    'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut
    With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.

                      CLXVII.

    And, secondly, I pity not, because
      He had no business to commit a sin,
    Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws;--
      At least 't was rather early to begin,
    But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws
      So much as when we call our old debts in
    At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,
    And find a deuced balance with the Devil.

                      CLXVIII.

    Of his position I can give no notion:
      'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,
    How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,
      Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,
    When old King David's blood grew dull in motion,
      And that the medicine answered very well;
    Perhaps 't was in a different way applied,
    For David lived, but Juan nearly died.

                      CLXIX.

    What's to be done? Alfonso will be back
      The moment he has sent his fools away.
    Antonia's skill was put upon the rack,
      But no device could be brought into play--
    And how to parry the renewed attack?
      Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:
    Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,
    But pressed her bloodless lip to Juan's cheek.

                      CLXX.

    He turned his lip to hers, and with his hand
      Called back the tangles of her wandering hair;
    Even then their love they could not all command,
      And half forgot their danger and despair:
    Antonia's patience now was at a stand--
      "Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,"
    She whispered, in great wrath--"I must deposit
    This pretty gentleman within the closet:

                      CLXXI.

    "Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night--
      Who can have put my master in this mood?
    What will become on 't--I'm in such a fright,
      The Devil's in the urchin, and no good--
    Is this a time for giggling? this a plight?
      Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?
    You'll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,
    My mistress all, for that half-girlish face.

                      CLXXII.

    "Had it but been for a stout cavalier
      Of twenty-five or thirty--(come, make haste)
    But for a child, what piece of work is here!
      I really, madam, wonder at your taste--
    (Come, sir, get in)--my master must be near:
      There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,
    And if we can but till the morning keep
    Our counsel--(Juan, mind, you must not sleep.)"

                      CLXXIII.

    Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,
      Closed the oration of the trusty maid:
    She loitered, and he told her to be gone,
      An order somewhat sullenly obeyed;
    However, present remedy was none,
      And no great good seemed answered if she staid:
    Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,
    She snuffed the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.

                      CLXXIV.

    Alfonso paused a minute--then begun
      Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;
    He would not justify what he had done,
      To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;
    But there were ample reasons for it, none
      Of which he specified in this his pleading:
    His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,
    Of rhetoric, which the learned call "rigmarole."

                      CLXXV.

    Julia said nought; though all the while there rose
      A ready answer, which at once enables
    A matron, who her husband's foible knows,
      By a few timely words to turn the tables,
    Which, if it does not silence, still must pose,--
      Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;
    'T is to retort with firmness, and when he
    Suspects with one, do you reproach with three.

                      CLXXVI.

    Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,--
      Alfonso's loves with Inez were well known;
    But whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds--
      But that can't be, as has been often shown,
    A lady with apologies abounds;--
      It might be that her silence sprang alone
    From delicacy to Don Juan's ear,
    To whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.

                      CLXXVII.

    There might be one more motive, which makes two;
      Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,--
    Mentioned his jealousy, but never who
      Had been the happy lover, he concluded,
    Concealed amongst his premises; 't is true,
      His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;
    To speak of Inez now were, one may say,
    Like throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.

                      CLXXVIII.

    A hint, in tender cases, is enough;
      Silence is best: besides, there is a tact--
    (That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,
      But it will serve to keep my verse compact)--
    Which keeps, when pushed by questions rather rough,
      A lady always distant from the fact:
    The charming creatures lie with such a grace,
    There's nothing so becoming to the face.

                      CLXXIX.

    They blush, and we believe them; at least I
      Have always done so; 't is of no great use,
    In any case, attempting a reply,
      For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;
    And when at length they're out of breath, they sigh,
      And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose
    A tear or two, and then we make it up;
    And then--and then--and then--sit down and sup.

                      CLXXX.

    Alfonso closed his speech, and begged her pardon,
      Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,
    And laid conditions he thought very hard on,
      Denying several little things he wanted:
    He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,
      With useless penitence perplexed and haunted;
    Beseeching she no further would refuse,
    When, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes.

                      CLXXXI.

    A pair of shoes!--what then? not much, if they
      Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these
    (No one can tell how much I grieve to say)
      Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,
    Was but a moment's act.--Ah! well-a-day!
      My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze!
    Alfonso first examined well their fashion,
    And then flew out into another passion.

                      CLXXXII.

    He left the room for his relinquished sword,
      And Julia instant to the closet flew.
    "Fly, Juan, fly! for Heaven's sake--not a word--
      The door is open--you may yet slip through
    The passage you so often have explored--
      Here is the garden-key--Fly--fly--Adieu!
    Haste--haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet--
    Day has not broke--there's no one in the street."

                      CLXXXIII.

    None can say that this was not good advice,
      The only mischief was, it came too late;
    Of all experience 't is the usual price,
      A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:
    Juan had reached the room-door in a trice,
      And might have done so by the garden-gate,
    But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,
    Who threatened death--so Juan knocked him down.

                      CLXXXIV.

    Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;
      Antonia cried out "Rape!" and Julia "Fire!"
    But not a servant stirred to aid the fight.
      Alfonso, pommelled to his heart's desire,
    Swore lustily he'd be revenged this night;
      And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;
    His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,
    And not at all disposed to prove a martyr.

                      CLXXXV.

    Alfonso's sword had dropped ere he could draw it,
      And they continued battling hand to hand,
    For Juan very luckily ne'er saw it;
      His temper not being under great command,
    If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,
      Alfonso's days had not been in the land
    Much longer.--Think of husbands', lovers' lives!
    And how ye may be doubly widows--wives!

                      CLXXXVI.

    Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,
      And Juan throttled him to get away,
    And blood ('t was from the nose) began to flow;
      At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,
    Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,
      And then his only garment quite gave way;
    He fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,
    I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.

                      CLXXXVII.

    Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found
      An awkward spectacle their eyes before;
    Antonia in hysterics, Julia swooned,
      Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;
    Some half-torn drapery scattered on the ground,
      Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:
    Juan the gate gained, turned the key about,
    And liking not the inside, locked the out.

                      CLXXXVIII.

    Here ends this canto.--Need I sing, or say,
      How Juan, naked, favoured by the night,
    Who favours what she should not, found his way,
      And reached his home in an unseemly plight?
    The pleasant scandal which arose next day,
      The nine days' wonder which was brought to light,
    And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,
    Were in the English newspapers, of course.

                      CLXXXIX.

    If you would like to see the whole proceedings,
      The depositions, and the Cause at full,
    The names of all the witnesses, the pleadings
      Of Counsel to nonsuit, or to annul,
    There's more than one edition, and the readings
      Are various, but they none of them are dull:
    The best is that in short-hand ta'en by Gurney,
    Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey.

                      CXC.

    But Donna Inez, to divert the train
      Of one of the most circulating scandals
    That had for centuries been known in Spain,
      At least since the retirement of the Vandals,
    First vowed (and never had she vowed in vain)
      To Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;
    And then, by the advice of some old ladies,
    She sent her son to be shipped off from Cadiz.

                      CXCI.

    She had resolved that he should travel through
      All European climes, by land or sea,
    To mend his former morals, and get new,
      Especially in France and Italy--
    (At least this is the thing most people do.)
      Julia was sent into a convent--she
    Grieved--but, perhaps, her feelings may be better
    Shown in the following copy of her Letter:--

                      CXCII.

    "They tell me 't is decided you depart:
      'T is wise--'t is well, but not the less a pain;
    I have no further claim on your young heart,
      Mine is the victim, and would be again:
    To love too much has been the only art
      I used;--I write in haste, and if a stain
    Be on this sheet, 't is not what it appears;
    My eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.

                      CXCIII.

    "I loved, I love you, for this love have lost
      State, station, Heaven, Mankind's, my own esteem,
    And yet can not regret what it hath cost,
      So dear is still the memory of that dream;
    Yet, if I name my guilt, 't is not to boast,
      None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:
    I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest--
    I've nothing to reproach, or to request.

                      CXCIV.

    "Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,
      'T is a Woman's whole existence; Man may range
    The Court, Camp, Church, the Vessel, and the Mart;
      Sword, Gown, Gain, Glory, offer in exchange
    Pride, Fame, Ambition, to fill up his heart,
      And few there are whom these can not estrange;
    Men have all these resources, We but one,
    To love again, and be again undone."

                      CXCV.

    "You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,
      Beloved and loving many; all is o'er
    For me on earth, except some years to hide
      My shame and sorrow deep in my heart's core:
    These I could bear, but cannot cast aside
      The passion which still rages as before,--
    And so farewell--forgive me, love me--No,
    That word is idle now--but let it go.

                      CXCVI.

    "My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;
      But still I think I can collect my mind;
    My blood still rushes where my spirit's set,
      As roll the waves before the settled wind;
    My heart is feminine, nor can forget--
      To all, except one image, madly blind;
    So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,
    As vibrates my fond heart to my fixed soul.

                      CXCVII.

    "I have no more to say, but linger still,
      And dare not set my seal upon this sheet,
    And yet I may as well the task fulfil,
      My misery can scarce be more complete;
    I had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;
      Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,
    And I must even survive this last adieu,
    And bear with life, to love and pray for you!"

                      CXCVIII.

    This note was written upon gilt-edged paper
      With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new;
    Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,
      It trembled as magnetic needles do,
    And yet she did not let one tear escape her;
      The seal a sun-flower; "Elle vous suit partout,"
    The motto cut upon a white cornelian;
    The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.

                      CXCIX.

    This was Don Juan's earliest scrape; but whether
      I shall proceed with his adventures is
    Dependent on the public altogether;
      We'll see, however, what they say to this:
    Their favour in an author's cap's a feather,
      And no great mischief's done by their caprice;
    And if their approbation we experience,
    Perhaps they'll have some more about a year hence.

    My poem's epic, and is meant to be
      Divided in twelve books; each book containing,
    With Love, and War, a heavy gale at sea,
      A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,
    New characters; the episodes are three:
      A panoramic view of Hell's in training,
    After the style of Virgil and of Homer,
    So that my name of Epic's no misnomer.

                      CCI.

    All these things will be specified in time,
      With strict regard to Aristotle's rules,
    The Vade Mecum of the true sublime,
      Which makes so many poets, and some fools:
    Prose poets like blank-verse, I'm fond of rhyme,
      Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;
    I've got new mythological machinery,
    And very handsome supernatural scenery.

                      CCII.

    There's only one slight difference between
      Me and my epic brethren gone before,
    And here the advantage is my own, I ween
      (Not that I have not several merits more,
    But this will more peculiarly be seen);
      They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore
    Their labyrinth of fables to thread through,
    Whereas this story's actually true.

                      CCIII.

    If any person doubt it, I appeal
      To History, Tradition, and to Facts,
    To newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,
      To plays in five, and operas in three acts;
    All these confirm my statement a good deal,
      But that which more completely faith exacts
    Is, that myself, and several now in Seville,
    Saw Juan's last elopement with the Devil.

                      CCIV.

    If ever I should condescend to prose,
      I'll write poetical commandments, which
    Shall supersede beyond all doubt all those
      That went before; in these I shall enrich
    My text with many things that no one knows,
      And carry precept to the highest pitch:
    I'll call the work "Longinus o'er a Bottle,
    Or, Every Poet his own Aristotle."

                      CCV.

    Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;
      Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;
    Because the first is crazed beyond all hope,
      The second drunk, the third so quaint and mouthy:
    With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,
      And Campbell's Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:
    Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor
    Commit--flirtation with the muse of Moore.

                      CCVI.

    Thou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby's Muse,
      His Pegasus, nor anything that's his;
    Thou shalt not bear false witness like "the Blues"--
      (There's one, at least, is very fond of this);
    Thou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:
      This is true criticism, and you may kiss--
    Exactly as you please, or not,--the rod;
    But if you don't, I'll lay it on, by G--d!

                      CCVII.

    If any person should presume to assert
      This story is not moral, first, I pray,
    That they will not cry out before they're hurt,
      Then that they'll read it o'er again, and say
    (But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)
      That this is not a moral tale, though gay:
    Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show
    The very place where wicked people go.

                      CCVIII.

    If, after all, there should be some so blind
      To their own good this warning to despise,
    Led by some tortuosity of mind,
      Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,
    And cry that they "the moral cannot find,"
      I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;
    Should captains the remark, or critics, make,
    They also lie too--under a mistake.

                      CCIX.

    The public approbation I expect,
      And beg they'll take my word about the moral,
    Which I with their amusement will connect
      (So children cutting teeth receive a coral);
    Meantime they'll doubtless please to recollect
      My epical pretensions to the laurel:
    For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,
    I've bribed my Grandmother's Review--the British.

                      CCX.

    I sent it in a letter to the Editor,
      Who thanked me duly by return of post--
    I'm for a handsome article his creditor;
      Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,
    And break a promise after having made it her,
      Denying the receipt of what it cost,
    And smear his page with gall instead of honey,
    All I can say is--that he had the money.

                      CCXI.

    I think that with this holy new alliance
      I may ensure the public, and defy
    All other magazines of art or science,
      Daily, or monthly, or three monthly; I
    Have not essayed to multiply their clients,
      Because they tell me 't were in vain to try,
    And that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly
    Treat a dissenting author very martyrly.

                      CCXII.

    "Non ego hoc ferrem calidus juventa
      Consule Planco" Horace said, and so
    Say I; by which quotation there is meant a
      Hint that some six or seven good years ago
    (Long ere I dreamt of dating from the Brenta)
      I was most ready to return a blow,
    And would not brook at all this sort of thing
    In my hot youth--when George the Third was King.

                      CCXIII.

    But now at thirty years my hair is grey--
      (I wonder what it will be like at forty?
    I thought of a peruke the other day--)
      My heart is not much greener; and, in short, I
    Have squandered my whole summer while 't was May,
      And feel no more the spirit to retort; I
    Have spent my life, both interest and principal,
    And deem not, what I deemed--my soul invincible.

                      CCXIV.

    No more--no more--Oh! never more on me
      The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,
    Which out of all the lovely things we see
      Extracts emotions beautiful and new,
    Hived in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee.
      Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?
    Alas! 't was not in them, but in thy power
    To double even the sweetness of a flower.

                      CCXV.

    No more--no more--Oh! never more, my heart,
      Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!
    Once all in all, but now a thing apart,
      Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:
    The illusion's gone for ever, and thou art
      Insensible, I trust, but none the worse,
    And in thy stead I've got a deal of judgment,
    Though Heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.

                      CCXVI.

    My days of love are over; me no more
      The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,
    Can make the fool of which they made before,--
      In short, I must not lead the life I did do;
    The credulous hope of mutual minds is o'er,
      The copious use of claret is forbid too,
    So for a good old-gentlemanly vice,
    I think I must take up with avarice.

                      CCXVII.

    Ambition was my idol, which was broken
      Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;
    And the two last have left me many a token
      O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:
    Now, like Friar Bacon's Brazen Head, I've spoken,
      "Time is, Time was, Time's past:"--a chymic treasure
    Is glittering Youth, which I have spent betimes--
    My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.

                      CCXVIII.

    What is the end of Fame? 't is but to fill
      A certain portion of uncertain paper:
    Some liken it to climbing up a hill,
      Whose summit, like all hills, is lost in vapour;
    For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,
      And bards burn what they call their "midnight taper,"
    To have, when the original is dust,
    A name, a wretched picture and worse bust.

                      CCXIX.

    What are the hopes of man? Old Egypt's King
      Cheops erected the first Pyramid
    And largest, thinking it was just the thing
      To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;
    But somebody or other rummaging,
      Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
    Let not a monument give you or me hopes,
    Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.

                      CCXX.

    But I, being fond of true philosophy,
      Say very often to myself, "Alas!
    All things that have been born were born to die,
      And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;
    You've passed your youth not so unpleasantly,
      And if you had it o'er again--'t would pass--
    So thank your stars that matters are no worse,
    And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse."

                      CCXXI.

    But for the present, gentle reader! and
      Still gentler purchaser! the Bard--that's I--
    Must, with permission, shake you by the hand,
      And so--"your humble servant, and Good-bye!"
    We meet again, if we should understand
      Each other; and if not, I shall not try
    Your patience further than by this short sample--
    'T were well if others followed my example.

                      CCXXII.

    "Go, little Book, from this my solitude!
      I cast thee on the waters--go thy ways!
    And if, as I believe, thy vein be good,
      The World will find thee after many days."
    When Southey's read, and Wordsworth understood,
      I can't help putting in my claim to praise--
    The four first rhymes are Southey's every line:
    For God's sake, reader! take them not for mine.

               CANTO THE SECOND.

                      I.

    OH ye! who teach the ingenuous youth of nations,
      Holland, France, England, Germany, or Spain,
    I pray ye flog them upon all occasions--
      It mends their morals, never mind the pain:
    The best of mothers and of educations
      In Juan's case were but employed in vain,
    Since, in a way that's rather of the oddest, he
    Became divested of his native modesty.

                      II.

    Had he but been placed at a public school,
      In the third form, or even in the fourth,
    His daily task had kept his fancy cool,
      At least, had he been nurtured in the North;
    Spain may prove an exception to the rule,
      But then exceptions always prove its worth--
    A lad of sixteen causing a divorce
    Puzzled his tutors very much, of course.

                      III.

    I can't say that it puzzles me at all,
      If all things be considered: first, there was
    His lady-mother, mathematical,
      A----never mind;--his tutor, an old ass;
    A pretty woman--(that's quite natural,
      Or else the thing had hardly come to pass)
    A husband rather old, not much in unity
    With his young wife--a time, and opportunity.

                      IV.

    Well--well; the World must turn upon its axis,
      And all Mankind turn with it, heads or tails,
    And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,
      And as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails;
    The King commands us, and the Doctor quacks us,
      The Priest instructs, and so our life exhales,
    A little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,
    Fighting, devotion, dust,--perhaps a name.

                      V.

    I said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz--
      A pretty town, I recollect it well--
    'T is there the mart of the colonial trade is,
      (Or was, before Peru learned to rebel),
    And such sweet girls!--I mean, such graceful ladies,
      Their very walk would make your bosom swell;
    I can't describe it, though so much it strike,
    Nor liken it--I never saw the like:

                      VI.

    An Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb
      New broke, a camelopard, a gazelle,
    No--none of these will do;--and then their garb,
      Their veil and petticoat--Alas! to dwell
    Upon such things would very near absorb
      A canto--then their feet and ankles,--well,
    Thank Heaven I've got no metaphor quite ready,
    (And so, my sober Muse--come, let's be steady--

                      VII.

    Chaste Muse!--well,--if you must, you must)--the veil
      Thrown back a moment with the glancing hand,
    While the o'erpowering eye, that turns you pale,
      Flashes into the heart:--All sunny land
    Of Love! when I forget you, may I fail
      To----say my prayers--but never was there planned
    A dress through which the eyes give such a volley,
    Excepting the Venetian Fazzioli.
                      VIII.

    But to our tale: the Donna Inez sent
      Her son to Cadiz only to embark;
    To stay there had not answered her intent,
      But why?--we leave the reader in the dark--
    'T was for a voyage the young man was meant,
      As if a Spanish ship were Noah's ark,
    To wean him from the wickedness of earth,
    And send him like a Dove of Promise forth.

                      IX.

    Don Juan bade his valet pack his things
      According to direction, then received
    A lecture and some money: for four springs
      He was to travel; and though Inez grieved
    (As every kind of parting has its stings),
      She hoped he would improve--perhaps believed:
    A letter, too, she gave (he never read it)
    Of good advice--and two or three of credit.

                      X.

    In the mean time, to pass her hours away,
      Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school
    For naughty children, who would rather play
      (Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;
    Infants of three years old were taught that day,
      Dunces were whipped, or set upon a stool:
    The great success of Juan's education
    Spurred her to teach another generation.

                      XI.

    Juan embarked--the ship got under way,
      The wind was fair, the water passing rough;
    A devil of a sea rolls in that bay,
      As I, who've crossed it oft, know well enough;
    And, standing on the deck, the dashing spray
      Flies in one's face, and makes it weather-tough:
    And there he stood to take, and take again,
    His first--perhaps his last--farewell of Spain.

                      XII.

    I can't but say it is an awkward sight
      To see one's native land receding through
    The growing waters; it unmans one quite,
      Especially when life is rather new:
    I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,
      But almost every other country's blue,
    When gazing on them, mystified by distance,
    We enter on our nautical existence.

                      XIII.

    So Juan stood, bewildered on the deck:
      The wind sung, cordage strained, and sailors swore,
    And the ship creaked, the town became a speck,
      From which away so fair and fast they bore.
    The best of remedies is a beef-steak
      Against sea-sickness: try it, Sir, before
    You sneer, and I assure you this is true,
    For I have found it answer--so may you.

                      XIV.

    Don Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,
      Beheld his native Spain receding far:
    First partings form a lesson hard to learn,
      Even nations feel this when they go to war;
    There is a sort of unexpressed concern,
      A kind of shock that sets one's heart ajar,
    At leaving even the most unpleasant people
    And places--one keeps looking at the steeple.

                      XV.

    But Juan had got many things to leave,
      His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,
    So that he had much better cause to grieve
      Than many persons more advanced in life:
    And if we now and then a sigh must heave
      At quitting even those we quit in strife,
    No doubt we weep for those the heart endears--
    That is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.

                      XVI.

    So Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews
      By Babel's waters, still remembering Sion:
    I'd weep,--but mine is not a weeping Muse,
      And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;
    Young men should travel, if but to amuse
      Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on
    Behind their carriages their new portmanteau,
    Perhaps it may be lined with this my canto.

                      XVII.

    And Juan wept, and much he sighed and thought,
      While his salt tears dropped into the salt sea,
    "Sweets to the sweet;" (I like so much to quote;
      You must excuse this extract,--'t is where she,
    The Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought
      Flowers to the grave;) and, sobbing often, he
    Reflected on his present situation,
    And seriously resolved on reformation.

                      XVIII.

    "Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!" he cried,
      "Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,
    But die, as many an exiled heart hath died,
      Of its own thirst to see again thy shore:
    Farewell, where Guadalquivir's waters glide!
      Farewell, my mother! and, since all is o'er,
    Farewell, too, dearest Julia!--(here he drew
    Her letter out again, and read it through.)

                      XIX.

    "And oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear--
      But that's impossible, and cannot be--
    Sooner shall this blue Ocean melt to air,
      Sooner shall Earth resolve itself to sea,
    Than I resign thine image, oh, my fair!
      Or think of anything, excepting thee;
    A mind diseased no remedy can physic--
    (Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick.)

                      XX.

    "Sooner shall Heaven kiss earth--(here he fell sicker)
      Oh, Julia! what is every other woe?--
    (For God's sake let me have a glass of liquor;
      Pedro, Battista, help me down below.)
    Julia, my love!--(you rascal, Pedro, quicker)--
      Oh, Julia!--(this curst vessel pitches so)--
    Beloved Julia, hear me still beseeching!"
    (Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)

                      XXI.

    He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,
      Or rather stomach, which, alas! attends,
    Beyond the best apothecary's art,
      The loss of Love, the treachery of friends,
    Or death of those we dote on, when a part
      Of us dies with them as each fond hope ends:
    No doubt he would have been much more pathetic,
    But the sea acted as a strong emetic.

                      XXII.

    Love's a capricious power: I've known it hold
      Out through a fever caused by its own heat,
    But be much puzzled by a cough and cold,
      And find a quinsy very hard to treat;
    Against all noble maladies he's bold,
      But vulgar illnesses don't like to meet,
    Nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,
    Nor inflammations redden his blind eye.

                      XXIII.

    But worst of all is nausea, or a pain
      About the lower region of the bowels;
    Love, who heroically breathes a vein,
      Shrinks from the application of hot towels,
    And purgatives are dangerous to his reign,
      Sea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else
    Could Juan's passion, while the billows roar,
    Resist his stomach, ne'er at sea before?

                      XXIV.

    The ship, called the most holy "Trinidada,"
      Was steering duly for the port Leghorn;
    For there the Spanish family Moncada
      Were settled long ere Juan's sire was born:
    They were relations, and for them he had a
      Letter of introduction, which the morn
    Of his departure had been sent him by
    His Spanish friends for those in Italy.

                      XXV.

    His suite consisted of three servants and
      A tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,
    Who several languages did understand,
      But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow
    And, rocking in his hammock, longed for land,
      His headache being increased by every billow;
    And the waves oozing through the port-hole made
    His berth a little damp, and him afraid.

                      XXVI.

    'T was not without some reason, for the wind
      Increased at night, until it blew a gale;
    And though 't was not much to a naval mind,
      Some landsmen would have looked a little pale,
    For sailors are, in fact, a different kind:
      At sunset they began to take in sail,
    For the sky showed it would come on to blow,
    And carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.

                      XXVII.

    At one o'clock the wind with sudden shift
      Threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,
    Which struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,
      Started the stern-post, also shattered the
    Whole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift
      Herself from out her present jeopardy,
    The rudder tore away: 't was time to sound
    The pumps, and there were four feet water found.

                      XXVIII.

    One gang of people instantly was put
      Upon the pumps, and the remainder set
    To get up part of the cargo, and what not;
      But they could not come at the leak as yet;
    At last they did get at it really, but
      Still their salvation was an even bet:
    The water rushed through in a way quite puzzling,
    While they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,

                      XXIX.

    Into the opening; but all such ingredients
      Would have been vain, and they must have gone down,
    Despite of all their efforts and expedients,
      But for the pumps: I'm glad to make them known
    To all the brother tars who may have need hence,
      For fifty tons of water were upthrown
    By them per hour, and they had all been undone,
    But for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.

                      XXX.

    As day advanced the weather seemed to abate,
      And then the leak they reckoned to reduce,
    And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet
      Kept two hand--and one chain-pump still in use.
    The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late
      A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,
    A gust--which all descriptive power transcends--
    Laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.

                      XXXI.

    There she lay, motionless, and seemed upset;
      The water left the hold, and washed the decks,
    And made a scene men do not soon forget;
      For they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,
    Or any other thing that brings regret
      Or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:
    Thus drownings are much talked of by the divers,
    And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.

                      XXXII.

    Immediately the masts were cut away,
      Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,
    The main-mast followed: but the ship still lay
      Like a mere log, and baffled our intent.
    Foremast and bowsprit were cut down, and they
      Eased her at last (although we never meant
    To part with all till every hope was blighted),
    And then with violence the old ship righted.

                      XXXIII.

    It may be easily supposed, while this
      Was going on, some people were unquiet,
    That passengers would find it much amiss
      To lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;
    That even the able seaman, deeming his
      Days nearly o'er, might be disposed to riot,
    As upon such occasions tars will ask
    For grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.

                      XXXIV.

    There's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms
      As rum and true religion: thus it was,
    Some plundered, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,
      The high wind made the treble, and as bass
    The hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms
      Of all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:
    Strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,
    Clamoured in chorus to the roaring Ocean.

                      XXXV.

    Perhaps more mischief had been done, but for
      Our Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,
    Got to the spirit-room, and stood before
      It with a pair of pistols; and their fears,
    As if Death were more dreadful by his door
      Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,
    Kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,
    Thought it would be becoming to die drunk.

                      XXXVI.

    "Give us more grog," they cried, "for it will be
      All one an hour hence." Juan answered, "No!
    'T is true that Death awaits both you and me,
      But let us die like men, not sink below
    Like brutes:"--and thus his dangerous post kept he,
      And none liked to anticipate the blow;
    And even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,
    Was for some rum a disappointed suitor.

                      XXXVII.

    The good old gentleman was quite aghast,
      And made a loud and pious lamentation;
    Repented all his sins, and made a last
      Irrevocable vow of reformation;
    Nothing should tempt him more (this peril past)
      To quit his academic occupation,
    In cloisters of the classic Salamanca,
    To follow Juan's wake, like Sancho Panca.

                      XXXVIII.

    But now there came a flash of hope once more;
      Day broke, and the wind lulled: the masts were gone
    The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,
      The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.
    They tried the pumps again, and though before
      Their desperate efforts seemed all useless grown,
    A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale--
    The stronger pumped, the weaker thrummed a sail.

                      XXXIX.

    Under the vessel's keel the sail was passed,
      And for the moment it had some effect;
    But with a leak, and not a stick of mast,
      Nor rag of canvas, what could they expect?
    But still 't is best to struggle to the last,
      'T is never too late to be wholly wrecked:
    And though 't is true that man can only die once,
    'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.

                      XL.

    There winds and waves had hurled them, and from thence,
      Without their will, they carried them away;
    For they were forced with steering to dispense,
      And never had as yet a quiet day
    On which they might repose, or even commence
      A jurymast or rudder, or could say
    The ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,
    Still swam--though not exactly like a duck.

                      XLI.

    The wind, in fact, perhaps, was rather less,
      But the ship laboured so, they scarce could hope
    To weather out much longer; the distress
      Was also great with which they had to cope
    For want of water, and their solid mess
      Was scant enough: in vain the telescope
    Was used--nor sail nor shore appeared in sight,
    Nought but the heavy sea, and coming night.

                      XLII.

    Again the weather threatened,--again blew
      A gale, and in the fore and after hold
    Water appeared; yet, though the people knew
      All this, the most were patient, and some bold,
    Until the chains and leathers were worn through
      Of all our pumps:--a wreck complete she rolled,
    At mercy of the waves, whose mercies are
    Like human beings during civil war.

                      XLIII.

    Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears
      In his rough eyes, and told the captain, he
    Could do no more: he was a man in years,
      And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,
    And if he wept at length they were not fears
      That made his eyelids as a woman's be,
    But he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,--
    Two things for dying people quite bewildering.

                      XLIV.

    The ship was evidently settling now
      Fast by the head; and, all distinction gone,
    Some went to prayers again, and made a vow
      Of candles to their saints--but there were none
    To pay them with; and some looked o'er the bow;
      Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one
    That begged Pedrillo for an absolution,
    Who told him to be damned--in his confusion.

                      XLV.

    Some lashed them in their hammocks; some put on
      Their best clothes, as if going to a fair;
    Some cursed the day on which they saw the Sun,
      And gnashed their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;
    And others went on as they had begun,
      Getting the boats out, being well aware
    That a tight boat will live in a rough sea,
    Unless with breakers close beneath her lee.

                      XLVI.

    The worst of all was, that in their condition,
      Having been several days in great distress,
    'T was difficult to get out such provision
      As now might render their long suffering less:
    Men, even when dying, dislike inanition;
      Their stock was damaged by the weather's stress:
    Two casks of biscuit, and a keg of butter,
    Were all that could be thrown into the cutter.

                      XLVII.

    But in the long-boat they contrived to stow
      Some pounds of bread, though injured by the wet;
    Water, a twenty-gallon cask or so;
      Six flasks of wine; and they contrived to get
    A portion of their beef up from below,
      And with a piece of pork, moreover, met,
    But scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon--
    Then there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.

                      XLVIII.

    The other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had
      Been stove in the beginning of the gale;
    And the long-boat's condition was but bad,
      As there were but two blankets for a sail,
    And one oar for a mast, which a young lad
      Threw in by good luck over the ship's rail;
    And two boats could not hold, far less be stored,
    To save one half the people then on board.

                      XLIX.

    'T was twilight, and the sunless day went down
      Over the waste of waters; like a veil,
    Which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown
      Of one whose hate is masked but to assail.
    Thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,
      And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,
    And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear
    Been their familiar, and now Death was here.

                      L.

    Some trial had been making at a raft,
      With little hope in such a rolling sea,
    A sort of thing at which one would have laughed,
      If any laughter at such times could be,
    Unless with people who too much have quaffed,
      And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,
    Half epileptical, and half hysterical:--
    Their preservation would have been a miracle.

                      LI.

    At half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,
      And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,
    That still could keep afloat the struggling tars,
      For yet they strove, although of no great use:
    There was no light in heaven but a few stars,
      The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;
    She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,
    And, going down head foremost--sunk, in short.

                      LII.

    Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell--
      Then shrieked the timid, and stood still the brave,--
    Then some leaped overboard with dreadful yell,
      As eager to anticipate their grave;
    And the sea yawned around her like a hell,
      And down she sucked with her the whirling wave,
    Like one who grapples with his enemy,
    And strives to strangle him before he die.

                      LIII.

    And first one universal shriek there rushed,
      Louder than the loud Ocean, like a crash
    Of echoing thunder; and then all was hushed,
      Save the wild wind and the remorseless dash
    Of billows; but at intervals there gushed,
      Accompanied by a convulsive splash,
    A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry
    Of some strong swimmer in his agony.

                      LIV.

    The boats, as stated, had got off before,
      And in them crowded several of the crew;
    And yet their present hope was hardly more
      Than what it had been, for so strong it blew
    There was slight chance of reaching any shore;
      And then they were too many, though so few--
    Nine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,
    Were counted in them when they got afloat.

                      LV.

    All the rest perished; near two hundred souls
      Had left their bodies; and what's worse, alas!
    When over Catholics the Ocean rolls,
      They must wait several weeks before a mass
    Takes off one peck of purgatorial coals,
      Because, till people know what's come to pass,
    They won't lay out their money on the dead--
    It costs three francs for every mass that's said.

                      LVI.

    Juan got into the long-boat, and there
      Contrived to help Pedrillo to a place;
    It seemed as if they had exchanged their care,
      For Juan wore the magisterial face
    Which courage gives, while poor Pedrillo's pair
      Of eyes were crying for their owner's case:
    Battista, though, (a name called shortly Tita),
    Was lost by getting at some aqua-vita.

                      LVII.

    Pedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,
      But the same cause, conducive to his loss,
    Left him so drunk, he jumped into the wave,
      As o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,
    And so he found a wine-and-watery grave;
      They could not rescue him although so close,
    Because the sea ran higher every minute,
    And for the boat--the crew kept crowding in it.

                      LVIII.

    A small old spaniel,--which had been Don Jose's,
      His father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,
    For on such things the memory reposes
      With tenderness--stood howling on the brink,
    Knowing, (dogs have such intellectual noses!)
      No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;
    And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepped
    Off threw him in, then after him he leaped.

                      LIX.

    He also stuffed his money where he could
      About his person, and Pedrillo's too,
    Who let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,
      Not knowing what himself to say, or do,
    As every rising wave his dread renewed;
      But Juan, trusting they might still get through,
    And deeming there were remedies for any ill,
    Thus re-embarked his tutor and his spaniel.

                      LX.

    'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,
      That the sail was becalmed between the seas,
    Though on the wave's high top too much to set,
      They dared not take it in for all the breeze:
    Each sea curled o'er the stern, and kept them wet,
      And made them bale without a moment's ease,
    So that themselves as well as hopes were damped,
    And the poor little cutter quickly swamped.

                      LXI.

    Nine souls more went in her: the long-boat still
      Kept above water, with an oar for mast,
    Two blankets stitched together, answering ill
      Instead of sail, were to the oar made fast;
    Though every wave rolled menacing to fill,
      And present peril all before surpassed,
    They grieved for those who perished with the cutter,
    And also for the biscuit-casks and butter.

                      LXII.

    The sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign
      Of the continuance of the gale: to run
    Before the sea until it should grow fine,
      Was all that for the present could be done:
    A few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine
      Were served out to the people, who begun
    To faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags,
    And most of them had little clothes but rags.

                      LXIII.

    They counted thirty, crowded in a space
      Which left scarce room for motion or exertion;
    They did their best to modify their case,
      One half sate up, though numbed with the immersion,
    While t' other half were laid down in their place,
      At watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian
    Ague in its cold fit, they filled their boat,
    With nothing but the sky for a great coat.

                      LXIV.

    'T is very certain the desire of life
      Prolongs it: this is obvious to physicians,
    When patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,
      Survive through very desperate conditions,
    Because they still can hope, nor shines the knife
      Nor shears of Atropos before their visions:
    Despair of all recovery spoils longevity,
    And makes men's misery of alarming brevity.

                      LXV.

    'T is said that persons living on annuities
      Are longer lived than others,--God knows why,
    Unless to plague the grantors,--yet so true it is,
      That some, I really think, do never die:
    Of any creditors the worst a Jew it is,
      And that's their mode of furnishing supply:
    In my young days they lent me cash that way,
    Which I found very troublesome to pay.

                      LXVI.

    'T is thus with people in an open boat,
      They live upon the love of Life, and bear
    More than can be believed, or even thought,
      And stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;
    And hardship still has been the sailor's lot,
      Since Noah's ark went cruising here and there;
    She had a curious crew as well as cargo,
    Like the first old Greek privateer, the Argo.

                      LXVII.

    But man is a carnivorous production,
      And must have meals, at least one meal a day;
    He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,
      But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;
    Although his anatomical construction
      Bears vegetables, in a grumbling way,
    Your labouring people think, beyond all question,
    Beef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.

                      LXVIII.

    And thus it was with this our hapless crew;
      For on the third day there came on a calm,
    And though at first their strength it might renew,
      And lying on their weariness like balm,
    Lulled them like turtles sleeping on the blue
      Of Ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,
    And fell all ravenously on their provision,
    Instead of hoarding it with due precision.

                      LXIX.

    The consequence was easily foreseen--
      They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,
    In spite of all remonstrances, and then
      On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?
    They hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!
      And carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,
    But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,
    It would have been more wise to save their victual.

                      LXX.

    The fourth day came, but not a breath of air,
      And Ocean slumbered like an unweaned child:
    The fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,
      The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild--
    With their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)
      What could they do? and Hunger's rage grew wild:
    So Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,
    Was killed, and portioned out for present eating.

                      LXXI.

    On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,
      And Juan, who had still refused, because
    The creature was his father's dog that died,
      Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,
    With some remorse received (though first denied)
      As a great favour one of the fore-paws,
    Which he divided with Pedrillo, who
    Devoured it, longing for the other too.

                      LXXII.

    The seventh day, and no wind--the burning sun
      Blistered and scorched, and, stagnant on the sea,
    They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,
      Save in the breeze that came not: savagely
    They glared upon each other--all was done,
      Water, and wine, and food,--and you might see
    The longings of the cannibal arise
    (Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.

                      LXXIII.

    At length one whispered his companion, who
      Whispered another, and thus it went round,
    And then into a hoarser murmur grew,
      An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;
    And when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,
      'T was but his own, suppressed till now, he found:
    And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,
    And who should die to be his fellow's food.

                      LXXIV.

    But ere they came to this, they that day shared
      Some leathern caps, and what remained of shoes;
    And then they looked around them, and despaired,
      And none to be the sacrifice would choose;
    At length the lots were torn up, and prepared,
      But of materials that must shock the Muse--
    Having no paper, for the want of better,
    They took by force from Juan Julia's letter.

                      LXXV.

    The lots were made, and marked, and mixed, and handed,
      In silent horror, and their distribution
    Lulled even the savage hunger which demanded,
      Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;
    None in particular had sought or planned it,
      'T was Nature gnawed them to this resolution,
    By which none were permitted to be neuter--
    And the lot fell on Juan's luckless tutor.

                      LXXVI.

    He but requested to be bled to death:
      The surgeon had his instruments, and bled
    Pedrillo, and so gently ebbed his breath,
      You hardly could perceive when he was dead.
    He died as born, a Catholic in faith,
      Like most in the belief in which they're bred,
    And first a little crucifix he kissed,
    And then held out his jugular and wrist.

                      LXXVII.

    The surgeon, as there was no other fee,
      Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;
    But being thirstiest at the moment, he
      Preferred a draught from the fast-flowing veins:
    Part was divided, part thrown in the sea,
      And such things as the entrails and the brains
    Regaled two sharks, who followed o'er the billow--
    The sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.

                      LXXVIII.

    The sailors ate him, all save three or four,
      Who were not quite so fond of animal food;
    To these was added Juan, who, before
      Refusing his own spaniel, hardly could
    Feel now his appetite increased much more;
      'T was not to be expected that he should,
    Even in extremity of their disaster,
    Dine with them on his pastor and his master.

                      LXXIX.

    'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,
      The consequence was awful in the extreme;
    For they, who were most ravenous in the act,
      Went raging mad--Lord! how they did blaspheme!
    And foam, and roll, with strange convulsions racked,
      Drinking salt-water like a mountain-stream,
    Tearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,
    And, with hyaena-laughter, died despairing.

                      LXXX.

    Their numbers were much thinned by this infliction,
      And all the rest were thin enough, Heaven knows;
    And some of them had lost their recollection,
      Happier than they who still perceived their woes;
    But others pondered on a new dissection,
      As if not warned sufficiently by those
    Who had already perished, suffering madly,
    For having used their appetites so sadly.

                      LXXXI.

    And next they thought upon the master's mate,
      As fattest; but he saved himself, because,
    Besides being much averse from such a fate,
      There were some other reasons: the first was,
    He had been rather indisposed of late;
      And--that which chiefly proved his saving clause--
    Was a small present made to him at Cadiz,
    By general subscription of the ladies.

                      LXXXII.

    Of poor Pedrillo something still remained,
      But was used sparingly,--some were afraid,
    And others still their appetites constrained,
      Or but at times a little supper made;
    All except Juan, who throughout abstained,
      Chewing a piece of bamboo, and some lead:
    At length they caught two Boobies, and a Noddy,
    And then they left off eating the dead body.

                      LXXXIII.

    And if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,
      Remember Ugolino condescends
    To eat the head of his arch-enemy
      The moment after he politely ends
    His tale: if foes be food in Hell, at sea
      'T is surely fair to dine upon our friends,
    When Shipwreck's short allowance grows too scanty,
    Without being much more horrible than Dante.

                      LXXXIV.

    And the same night there fell a shower of rain,
      For which their mouths gaped, like the cracks of earth
    When dried to summer dust; till taught by pain,
      Men really know not what good water's worth;
    If you had been in Turkey or in Spain,
      Or with a famished boat's-crew had your berth,
    Or in the desert heard the camel's bell,
    You'd wish yourself where Truth is--in a well.

                      LXXXV.

    It poured down torrents, but they were no richer
      Until they found a ragged piece of sheet,
    Which served them as a sort of spongy pitcher,
      And when they deemed its moisture was complete,
    They wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher
      Might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet
    As a full pot of porter, to their thinking
    They ne'er till now had known the joys of drinking.

                      LXXXVI.

    And their baked lips, with many a bloody crack,
      Sucked in the moisture, which like nectar streamed;
    Their throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,
      As the rich man's in Hell, who vainly screamed
    To beg the beggar, who could not rain back
    A drop of dew, when every drop had seemed
    To taste of Heaven--If this be true, indeed,
    Some Christians have a comfortable creed.

                      LXXXVII.

    There were two fathers in this ghastly crew,
      And with them their two sons, of whom the one
    Was more robust and hardy to the view,
      But he died early; and when he was gone,
    His nearest messmate told his sire, who threw
      One glance at him, and said, "Heaven's will be done!
    I can do nothing," and he saw him thrown
    Into the deep without a tear or groan.

                      LXXXVIII.

    The other father had a weaklier child,
      Of a soft cheek, and aspect delicate;
    But the boy bore up long, and with a mild
      And patient spirit held aloof his fate;
    Little he said, and now and then he smiled,
      As if to win a part from off the weight
    He saw increasing on his father's heart,
    With the deep deadly thought, that they must part.

                      LXXXIX.

    And o'er him bent his sire, and never raised
      His eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam
    From his pale lips, and ever on him gazed,
      And when the wished-for shower at length was come,
    And the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,
      Brightened, and for a moment seemed to roam,
    He squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain
    Into his dying child's mouth--but in vain.

                      XC.

    The boy expired--the father held the clay,
      And looked upon it long, and when at last
    Death left no doubt, and the dead burthen lay
      Stiff on his heart, and pulse and hope were past,
    He watched it wistfully, until away
      'T was borne by the rude wave wherein't was cast;
    Then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering,
    And gave no sign of life, save his limbs quivering.

                      XCI.

    Now overhead a rainbow, bursting through
      The scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea,
    Resting its bright base on the quivering blue;
      And all within its arch appeared to be
    Clearer than that without, and its wide hue
      Waxed broad and waving, like a banner free,
    Then changed like to a bow that's bent, and then
    Forsook the dim eyes of these shipwrecked men.

                      XCII.

    It changed, of course; a heavenly Chameleon,
      The airy child of vapour and the sun,
    Brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,
      Baptized in molten gold, and swathed in dun,
    Glittering like crescents o'er a Turk's pavilion,
      And blending every colour into one,
    Just like a black eye in a recent scuffle
    (For sometimes we must box without the muffle).

                      XCIII.

    Our shipwrecked seamen thought it a good omen--
      It is as well to think so, now and then;
    'T was an old custom of the Greek and Roman,
      And may become of great advantage when
    Folks are discouraged; and most surely no men
      Had greater need to nerve themselves again
    Than these, and so this rainbow looked like Hope--
    Quite a celestial Kaleidoscope.

                      XCIV.

    About this time a beautiful white bird,
      Webfooted, not unlike a dove in size
    And plumage (probably it might have erred
      Upon its course), passed oft before their eyes,
    And tried to perch, although it saw and heard
      The men within the boat, and in this guise
    It came and went, and fluttered round them till
    Night fell:--this seemed a better omen still.

                      XCV.

    But in this case I also must remark,
      'T was well this bird of promise did not perch,
    Because the tackle of our shattered bark
      Was not so safe for roosting as a church;
    And had it been the dove from Noah's ark,
      Returning there from her successful search,
    Which in their way that moment chanced to fall,
    They would have eat her, olive-branch and all.

                      XCVI.

    With twilight it again came on to blow,
      But not with violence; the stars shone out,
    The boat made way; yet now they were so low,
      They knew not where nor what they were about;
    Some fancied they saw land, and some said "No!"
      The frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt--
    Some swore that they heard breakers, others guns,
    And all mistook about the latter once.

                      XCVII.

    As morning broke, the light wind died away,
      When he who had the watch sung out and swore,
    If 't was not land that rose with the Sun's ray,
      He wished that land he never might see more;
    And the rest rubbed their eyes and saw a bay,
      Or thought they saw, and shaped their course for shore;
    For shore it was, and gradually grew
    Distinct, and high, and palpable to view.

                      XCVIII.

    And then of these some part burst into tears,
      And others, looking with a stupid stare,
    Could not yet separate their hopes from fears,
      And seemed as if they had no further care;
    While a few prayed--(the first time for some years)--
      And at the bottom of the boat three were
    Asleep: they shook them by the hand and head,
    And tried to awaken them, but found them dead.

                      XCIX.

    The day before, fast sleeping on the water,
      They found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,
    And by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,
    Which yielded a day's life, and to their mind
    Proved even still a more nutritious matter,
      Because it left encouragement behind:
    They thought that in such perils, more than chance
    Had sent them this for their deliverance.

                      C.

    The land appeared a high and rocky coast,
      And higher grew the mountains as they drew,
    Set by a current, toward it: they were lost
      In various conjectures, for none knew
    To what part of the earth they had been tost,
      So changeable had been the winds that blew;
    Some thought it was Mount Aetna, some the highlands
    Of Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, or other islands.

                      CI.

    Meantime the current, with a rising gale,
      Still set them onwards to the welcome shore,
    Like Charon's bark of spectres, dull and pale:
      Their living freight was now reduced to four,
    And three dead, whom their strength could not avail
      To heave into the deep with those before,
    Though the two sharks still followed them, and dashed
    The spray into their faces as they splashed.

                      CII.

    Famine--despair--cold--thirst and heat, had done
      Their work on them by turns, and thinned them to
    Such things a mother had not known her son
      Amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew;
    By night chilled, by day scorched, thus one by one
      They perished, until withered to these few,
    But chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,
    In washing down Pedrillo with salt water.

                      CII.

    As they drew nigh the land, which now was seen
      Unequal in its aspect here and there,
    They felt the freshness of its growing green,
      That waved in forest-tops, and smoothed the air,
    And fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen
      From glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare--
    Lovely seemed any object that should sweep
    Away the vast--salt--dread--eternal Deep.

                      CIV.

    The shore looked wild, without a trace of man,
     And girt by formidable waves; but they
    Were mad for land, and thus their course they ran,
      Though right ahead the roaring breakers lay:
    A reef between them also now began
      To show its boiling surf and bounding spray,
    But finding no place for their landing better,
    They ran the boat for shore,--and overset her.

                      CV.

    But in his native stream, the Guadalquivir,
      Juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont;
    And having learnt to swim in that sweet river,
      Had often turned the art to some account:
    A better swimmer you could scarce see ever,
      He could, perhaps, have passed the Hellespont,
    As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)
    Leander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.

                      CVI.

    So here, though faint, emaciated, and stark,
      He buoyed his boyish limbs, and strove to ply
    With the quick wave, and gain, ere it was dark,
      The beach which lay before him, high and dry:
    The greatest danger here was from a shark,
      That carried off his neighbour by the thigh;
    As for the other two, they could not swim,
    So nobody arrived on shore but him.

                      CVII.

    Nor yet had he arrived but for the oar,
      Which, providentially for him, was washed
    Just as his feeble arms could strike no more,
      And the hard wave o'erwhelmed him as 't was dashed
    Within his grasp; he clung to it, and sore
      The waters beat while he thereto was lashed;
    At last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he
    Rolled on the beach, half-senseless, from the sea:

                      CVIII.

    There, breathless, with his digging nails he clung
      Fast to the sand, lest the returning wave,
    From whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,
      Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:
    And there he lay, full length, where he was flung,
      Before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,
    With just enough of life to feel its pain,
    And deem that it was saved, perhaps, in vain.

                      CIX.

    With slow and staggering effort he arose,
      But sunk again upon his bleeding knee
    And quivering hand; and then he looked for those
      Who long had been his mates upon the sea;
    But none of them appeared to share his woes,
      Save one, a corpse, from out the famished three,
    Who died two days before, and now had found
    An unknown barren beach for burial ground.

                      CX.

    And as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,
      And down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand
    Swam round and round, and all his senses passed:
      He fell upon his side, and his stretched hand
    Drooped dripping on the oar (their jury-mast),
      And, like a withered lily, on the land
    His slender frame and pallid aspect lay,
    As fair a thing as e'er was formed of clay.

                      CXI.

    How long in his damp trance young Juan lay
      He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,
    And Time had nothing more of night nor day
      For his congealing blood, and senses dim;
    And how this heavy faintness passed away
      He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,
    And tingling vein, seemed throbbing back to life,
    For Death, though vanquished, still retired with strife.

                      CXII.

    His eyes he opened, shut, again unclosed,
      For all was doubt and dizziness; he thought
    He still was in the boat, and had but dozed,
      And felt again with his despair o'erwrought,
    And wished it Death in which he had reposed,
      And then once more his feelings back were brought,
    And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen
    A lovely female face of seventeen.

                      CXIII.

    'T was bending close o'er his, and the small mouth
      Seemed almost prying into his for breath;
    And chafing him, the soft warm hand of youth
      Recalled his answering spirits back from Death:
    And, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe
      Each pulse to animation, till beneath
    Its gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh
    To these kind efforts made a low reply.

                      CXIV.

    Then was the cordial poured, and mantle flung
      Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm
    Raised higher the faint head which o'er it hung;
      And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,
    Pillowed his death-like forehead; then she wrung
      His dewy curls, long drenched by every storm;
    And watched with eagerness each throb that drew
    A sigh from his heaved bosom--and hers, too.

                      CXV.

    And lifting him with care into the cave,
      The gentle girl, and her attendant,--one
    Young, yet her elder, and of brow less grave,
      And more robust of figure,--then begun
    To kindle fire, and as the new flames gave
      Light to the rocks that roofed them, which the sun
    Had never seen, the maid, or whatsoe'er
    She was, appeared distinct, and tall, and fair.

                      CXVI.

    Her brow was overhung with coins of gold,
      That sparkled o'er the auburn of her hair--
    Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were rolled
      In braids behind; and though her stature were
    Even of the highest for a female mould,
      They nearly reached her heel; and in her air
    There was a something which bespoke command,
    As one who was a Lady in the land.

                      CXVII.

    Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes
      Were black as Death, their lashes the same hue,
    Of downcast length, in whose silk shadow lies
      Deepest attraction; for when to the view
    Forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,
      Ne'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;
    'T is as the snake late coiled, who pours his length,
    And hurls at once his venom and his strength.

                      CXVIII.

    Her brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye
      Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;
    Short upper lip--sweet lips! that make us sigh
      Ever to have seen such; for she was one
    Fit for the model of a statuary
      (A race of mere impostors, when all's done--
    I've seen much finer women, ripe and real,
    Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal).

                      CXIX.

    I'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just
      One should not rail without a decent cause:
    There was an Irish lady, to whose bust
      I ne'er saw justice done, and yet she was
    A frequent model; and if e'er she must
      Yield to stern Time and Nature's wrinkling laws,
    They will destroy a face which mortal thought
    Ne'er compassed, nor less mortal chisel wrought.

                      CXX.

    And such was she, the lady of the cave:
      Her dress was very different from the Spanish,
    Simpler, and yet of colours not so grave;
      For, as you know, the Spanish women banish
    Bright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave
      Around them (what I hope will never vanish)
    The basquina and the mantilla, they
    Seem at the same time mystical and gay.

                      CXXI.

    But with our damsel this was not the case:
      Her dress was many-coloured, finely spun;
    Her locks curled negligently round her face,
      But through them gold and gems profusely shone:
    Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace
      Flowed in her veil, and many a precious stone
    Flashed on her little hand; but, what was shocking,
    Her small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.

                      CXXII.

    The other female's dress was not unlike,
      But of inferior materials: she
    Had not so many ornaments to strike,
      Her hair had silver only, bound to be
    Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,
      Was coarser; and her air, though firm, less free;
    Her hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes
    As black, but quicker, and of smaller size.

                      CXXIII.

    And these two tended him, and cheered him both
      With food and raiment, and those soft attentions,
    Which are--as I must own--of female growth,
      And have ten thousand delicate inventions:
    They made a most superior mess of broth,
      A thing which poesy but seldom mentions,
    But the best dish that e'er was cooked since Homer's
    Achilles ordered dinner for new comers.

                      CXXIV.

    I'll tell you who they were, this female pair,
      Lest they should seem Princesses in disguise;
    Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air
      Of clap-trap, which your recent poets prize;
    And so, in short, the girls they really were
      They shall appear before your curious eyes,
    Mistress and maid; the first was only daughter
    Of an old man, who lived upon the water.

                      CXXV.

    A fisherman he had been in his youth,
      And still a sort of fisherman was he;
    But other speculations were, in sooth,
      Added to his connection with the sea,
    Perhaps not so respectable, in truth:
      A little smuggling, and some piracy,
    Left him, at last, the sole of many masters
    Of an ill-gotten million of piastres.

                      CXXVI.

    A fisher, therefore, was he,--though of men,
      Like Peter the Apostle, and he fished
    For wandering merchant-vessels, now and then,
      And sometimes caught as many as he wished;
    The cargoes he confiscated, and gain
      He sought in the slave-market too, and dished
    Full many a morsel for that Turkish trade,
    By which, no doubt, a good deal may be made.

                      CXXVII.

    He was a Greek, and on his isle had built
      (One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)
    A very handsome house from out his guilt,
      And there he lived exceedingly at ease;
    Heaven knows what cash he got, or blood he spilt,
      A sad old fellow was he, if you please;
    But this I know, it was a spacious building,
    Full of barbaric carving, paint, and gilding.

                      CXXVIII.

    He had an only daughter, called Haidee,
      The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;
    Besides, so very beautiful was she,
      Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:
    Still in her teens, and like a lovely tree
      She grew to womanhood, and between whiles
    Rejected several suitors, just to learn
    How to accept a better in his turn.

                      CXXIX.

    And walking out upon the beach, below
      The cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,
    Insensible,--not dead, but nearly so,--
      Don Juan, almost famished, and half drowned;
    But being naked, she was shocked, you know,
      Yet deemed herself in common pity bound,
    As far as in her lay, "to take him in,
    A stranger" dying--with so white a skin.

                      CXXX.

    But taking him into her father's house
      Was not exactly the best way to save,
    But like conveying to the cat the mouse,
      Or people in a trance into their grave;
    Because the good old man had so much "nous",
      Unlike the honest Arab thieves so brave,
    He would have hospitably cured the stranger,
    And sold him instantly when out of danger.

                      CXXXI.

    And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best
      (A virgin always on her maid relies)
    To place him in the cave for present rest:
      And when, at last, he opened his black eyes,
    Their charity increased about their guest;
      And their compassion grew to such a size,
    It opened half the turnpike-gates to Heaven--
    (St. Paul says, 't is the toll which must be given).

                      CXXXII.

    They made a fire,--but such a fire as they
      Upon the moment could contrive with such
    Materials as were cast up round the bay,--
      Some broken planks, and oars, that to the touch
    Were nearly tinder, since, so long they lay,
      A mast was almost crumbled to a crutch;
    But, by God's grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,
    That there was fuel to have furnished twenty.

                      CXXXIII.

    He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,
      For Haidee stripped her sables off to make
    His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,
      And warm, in case by chance he should awake,
    They also gave a petticoat apiece,
      She and her maid,--and promised by daybreak
    To pay him a fresh visit, with a dish
    For breakfast, of eggs, coffee, bread, and fish.

                      CXXXIV.

    And thus they left him to his lone repose:
      Juan slept like a top, or like the dead,
    Who sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows),
      Just for the present; and in his lulled head
    Not even a vision of his former woes
      Throbbed in accursed dreams, which sometimes spread
    Unwelcome visions of our former years,
    Till the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears.

                      CXXXV.

    Young Juan slept all dreamless:--but the maid,
      Who smoothed his pillow, as she left the den
    Looked back upon him, and a moment stayed,
      And turned, believing that he called again.
    He slumbered; yet she thought, at least she said
      (The heart will slip, even as the tongue and pen),
    He had pronounced her name--but she forgot
    That at this moment Juan knew it not.

                      CXXXVI.

    And pensive to her father's house she went,
      Enjoining silence strict to Zoe, who
    Better than her knew what, in fact, she meant,
      She being wiser by a year or two:
    A year or two's an age when rightly spent,
      And Zoe spent hers, as most women do,
    In gaining all that useful sort of knowledge
    Which is acquired in Nature's good old college.

                      CXXXVII.

    The morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still
      Fast in his cave, and nothing clashed upon
    His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,
      And the young beams of the excluded Sun,
    Troubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;
      And need he had of slumber yet, for none
    Had suffered more--his hardships were comparative
    To those related in my grand-dad's "Narrative."

                      CXXXVIII.

    Not so Haidee: she sadly tossed and tumbled,
      And started from her sleep, and, turning o'er,
    Dreamed of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,
      And handsome corpses strewed upon the shore;
    And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,
      And called her father's old slaves up, who swore
    In several oaths--Armenian, Turk, and Greek--
    They knew not what to think of such a freak.

                      CXXXIX.

    But up she got, and up she made them get,
      With some pretence about the Sun, that makes
    Sweet skies just when he rises, or is set;
      And 't is, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks
    Bright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet
      With mist, and every bird with him awakes,
    And night is flung off like a mourning suit
    Worn for a husband,--or some other brute.

                      CXL.

    I say, the Sun is a most glorious sight,
      I've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late
    I have sat up on purpose all the night,
      Which hastens, as physicians say, one's fate;
    And so all ye, who would be in the right
      In health and purse, begin your day to date
    From daybreak, and when coffined at fourscore,
    Engrave upon the plate, you rose at four.

                      CXLI.

    And Haidee met the morning face to face;
      Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush
    Had dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race
      From heart to cheek is curbed into a blush,
    Like to a torrent which a mountain's base,
      That overpowers some Alpine river's rush,
    Checks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;
    Or the Red Sea--but the sea is not red.

                      CXLII.

    And down the cliff the island virgin came,
      And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,
    While the Sun smiled on her with his first flame,
      And young Aurora kissed her lips with dew,
    Taking her for a sister; just the same
      Mistake you would have made on seeing the two,
    Although the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,
    Had all the advantage, too, of not being air.

                      CXLIII.

    And when into the cavern Haidee stepped
      All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw
    That like an infant Juan sweetly slept;
      And then she stopped, and stood as if in awe
    (For sleep is awful), and on tiptoe crept
      And wrapped him closer, lest the air, too raw,
    Should reach his blood, then o'er him still as Death
    Bent, with hushed lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath.

                      CXLIV.

    And thus like to an Angel o'er the dying
      Who die in righteousness, she leaned; and there
    All tranquilly the shipwrecked boy was lying,
      As o'er him lay the calm and stirless air:
    But Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,
      Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair
    Must breakfast--and, betimes, lest they should ask it,
    She drew out her provision from the basket.

                      CXLV.

    She knew that the best feelings must have victual,
      And that a shipwrecked youth would hungry be;
    Besides, being less in love, she yawned a little,
      And felt her veins chilled by the neighbouring sea;
    And so, she cooked their breakfast to a tittle;
      I can't say that she gave them any tea,
    But there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,
    With Scio wine,--and all for love, not money.

                      CXLVI.

    And Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and
      The coffee made, would fain have wakened Juan;
    But Haidee stopped her with her quick small hand,
      And without word, a sign her finger drew on
    Her lip, which Zoe needs must understand;
      And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,
    Because her mistress would not let her break
    That sleep which seemed as it would ne'er awake.

                      CXLVII.

    For still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek
      A purple hectic played like dying day
    On the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak
      Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,
    Where the blue veins looked shadowy, shrunk, and weak;
      And his black curls were dewy with the spray,
    Which weighed upon them yet, all damp and salt,
    Mixed with the stony vapours of the vault.

                      CXLVIII.

    And she bent o'er him, and he lay beneath,
      Hushed as the babe upon its mother's breast,
    Drooped as the willow when no winds can breathe,
      Lulled like the depth of Ocean when at rest,
    Fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath,
      Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest;
    In short, he was a very pretty fellow,
    Although his woes had turned him rather yellow.

                      CXLIX.

    He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,
      But the fair face which met his eyes forbade
    Those eyes to close, though weariness and pain
      Had further sleep a further pleasure made:
    For Woman's face was never formed in vain
      For Juan, so that even when he prayed
    He turned from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,
    To the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary.

                      CL.

    And thus upon his elbow he arose,
      And looked upon the lady, in whose cheek
    The pale contended with the purple rose,
      As with an effort she began to speak;
    Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,
      Although she told him, in good modern Greek,
    With an Ionian accent, low and sweet,
    That he was faint, and must not talk, but eat.

                      CLI.

    Now Juan could not understand a word,
      Being no Grecian; but he had an ear,
    And her voice was the warble of a bird,
      So soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,
    That finer, simpler music ne'er was heard;
      The sort of sound we echo with a tear,
    Without knowing why--an overpowering tone,
    Whence Melody descends as from a throne.

                      CLII.

    And Juan gazed as one who is awoke
      By a distant organ, doubting if he be
    Not yet a dreamer, till the spell is broke
      By the watchman, or some such reality,
    Or by one's early valet's cursed knock;
      At least it is a heavy sound to me,
    Who like a morning slumber--for the night
    Shows stars and women in a better light.

                      CLIII.

    And Juan, too, was helped out from his dream,
      Or sleep, or whatsoe'er it was, by feeling
    A most prodigious appetite; the steam
      Of Zoe's cookery no doubt was stealing
    Upon his senses, and the kindling beam
      Of the new fire, which Zoe kept up, kneeling,
    To stir her viands, made him quite awake
    And long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak.

                      CLIV.

    But beef is rare within these oxless isles;
      Goat's flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton,
    And, when a holiday upon them smiles,
      A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:
    But this occurs but seldom, between whiles,
      For some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on;
    Others are fair and fertile, among which
    This, though not large, was one of the most rich.

                      CLV.

    I say that beef is rare, and can't help thinking
      That the old fable of the Minotaur--From
    which our modern morals, rightly shrinking,
      Condemn the royal lady's taste who wore
    A cow's shape for a mask--was only (sinking
      The allegory) a mere type, no more,
    That Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,
    To make the Cretans bloodier in battle.

                      CLVI.

    For we all know that English people are
      Fed upon beef--I won't say much of beer,
    Because 't is liquor only, and being far
      From this my subject, has no business here;
    We know, too, they are very fond of war,
      A pleasure--like all pleasures--rather dear;
    So were the Cretans--from which I infer,
    That beef and battles both were owing to her.

                      CLVII.

    But to resume. The languid Juan raised
      His head upon his elbow, and he saw
    A sight on which he had not lately gazed,
      As all his latter meals had been quite raw,
    Three or four things, for which the Lord he praised,
      And, feeling still the famished vulture gnaw,
    He fell upon whate'er was offered, like
    A priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike.

                      CLVIII.

    He ate, and he was well supplied; and she,
      Who watched him like a mother, would have fed
    Him past all bounds, because she smiled to see
      Such appetite in one she had deemed dead:
    But Zoe, being older than Haidee,
      Knew (by tradition, for she ne'er had read)
    That famished people must be slowly nurst,
    And fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst.

                      CLIX.

    And so she took the liberty to state,
      Rather by deeds than words, because the case
    Was urgent, that the gentleman, whose fate
      Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace
    The sea-shore at this hour, must leave his plate,
      Unless he wished to die upon the place--
    She snatched it, and refused another morsel,
    Saying, he had gorged enough to make a horse ill.

                      CLX.

    Next they--he being naked, save a tattered
      Pair of scarce decent trowsers--went to work,
    And in the fire his recent rags they scattered,
      And dressed him, for the present, like a Turk,
    Or Greek--that is, although it not much mattered,
      Omitting turban, slippers, pistol, dirk,--
    They furnished him, entire, except some stitches,
    With a clean shirt, and very spacious breeches.

                      CLXI.

    And then fair Haidee tried her tongue at speaking,
      But not a word could Juan comprehend,
    Although he listened so that the young Greek in
      Her earnestness would ne'er have made an end;
    And, as he interrupted not, went eking
      Her speech out to her protege and friend,
    Till pausing at the last her breath to take,
    She saw he did not understand Romaic.

                      CLXII.

    And then she had recourse to nods, and signs,
      And smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,
    And read (the only book she could) the lines
      Of his fair face, and found, by sympathy,
    The answer eloquent, where the Soul shines
      And darts in one quick glance a long reply;
    And thus in every look she saw expressed
    A world of words, and things at which she guessed.

                      CLXIII.

    And now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,
      And words repeated after her, he took
    A lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,
      No doubt, less of her language than her look:
    As he who studies fervently the skies
      Turns oftener to the stars than to his book,
    Thus Juan learned his alpha beta better
    From Haidee's glance than any graven letter.

                      CLXIV.

    'T is pleasing to be schooled in a strange tongue
      By female lips and eyes--that is, I mean,
    When both the teacher and the taught are young,
      As was the case, at least, where I have been;
    They smile so when one's right, and when one's wrong
      They smile still more, and then there intervene
    Pressure of hands, perhaps even a chaste kiss;--
    I learned the little that I know by this:

                      CLXV.

    That is, some words of Spanish, Turk, and Greek,
      Italian not at all, having no teachers;
    Much English I cannot pretend to speak,
      Learning that language chiefly from its preachers,
    Barrow, South, Tillotson, whom every week
      I study, also Blair--the highest reachers
    Of eloquence in piety and prose--
    I hate your poets, so read none of those.

                      CLXVI.

    As for the ladies, I have nought to say,
      A wanderer from the British world of Fashion,
    Where I, like other "dogs, have had my day,"
      Like other men, too, may have had my passion--
    But that, like other things, has passed away,
      And all her fools whom I could lay the lash on:
    Foes, friends, men, women, now are nought to me
    But dreams of what has been, no more to be.

                      CLXVII.

    Return we to Don Juan. He begun
      To hear new words, and to repeat them; but
    Some feelings, universal as the Sun,
      Were such as could not in his breast be shut
    More than within the bosom of a nun:
      He was in love,--as you would be, no doubt,
    With a young benefactress,--so was she,
    Just in the way we very often see.

                      CLXVIII.

    And every day by daybreak--rather early
      For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest--
    She came into the cave, but it was merely
      To see her bird reposing in his nest;
    And she would softly stir his locks so curly,
      Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,
    Breathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,
    As o'er a bed of roses the sweet South.

                      CLXIX.

    And every morn his colour freshlier came,
      And every day helped on his convalescence;
    'T was well, because health in the human frame
      Is pleasant, besides being true Love's essence,
    For health and idleness to Passion's flame
      Are oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons
    Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,
    Without whom Venus will not long attack us.

                      CLXX.

    While Venus fills the heart, (without heart really
      Love, though good always, is not quite so good,)
    Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli,--
      For Love must be sustained like flesh and blood,--While
    Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly:
      Eggs, oysters, too, are amatory food;
    But who is their purveyor from above
    Heaven knows,--it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.

                      CLXXI.

    When Juan woke he found some good things ready,
      A bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes
    That ever made a youthful heart less steady,
      Besides her maid's, as pretty for their size;
    But I have spoken of all this already--
      A repetition's tiresome and unwise,--
    Well--Juan, after bathing in the sea,
    Came always back to coffee and Haidee.

                      CLXXII.

    Both were so young, and one so innocent,
      That bathing passed for nothing; Juan seemed
    To her, as 't were, the kind of being sent,
      Of whom these two years she had nightly dreamed,
    A something to be loved, a creature meant
      To be her happiness, and whom she deemed
    To render happy; all who joy would win
    Must share it,--Happiness was born a Twin.

                      CLXXIII.

    It was such pleasure to behold him, such
      Enlargement of existence to partake
    Nature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,
      To watch him slumbering, and to see him wake:
    To live with him for ever were too much;
      But then the thought of parting made her quake;
    He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast
    Like a rich wreck--her first love, and her last.

                      CLXXIV.

    And thus a moon rolled on, and fair Haidee
      Paid daily visits to her boy, and took
    Such plentiful precautions, that still he
      Remained unknown within his craggy nook;
    At last her father's prows put out to sea,
      For certain merchantmen upon the look,
    Not as of yore to carry off an Io,
    But three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio.

                      CLXXV.

    Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,
      So that, her father being at sea, she was
    Free as a married woman, or such other
      Female, as where she likes may freely pass,
    Without even the encumbrance of a brother,
      The freest she that ever gazed on glass:
    I speak of Christian lands in this comparison,
    Where wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison.

                      CLXXVI.

    Now she prolonged her visits and her talk
      (For they must talk), and he had learnt to say
    So much as to propose to take a walk,--
      For little had he wandered since the day
    On which, like a young flower snapped from the stalk,
      Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,--
    And thus they walked out in the afternoon,
    And saw the sun set opposite the moon.

                      CLXXVII.

    It was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,
      With cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,
    Guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,
      With here and there a creek, whose aspect wore
    A better welcome to the tempest-tost;
      And rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,
    Save on the dead long summer days, which make
    The outstretched Ocean glitter like a lake.

                      CLXXVIII.

    And the small ripple spilt upon the beach
      Scarcely o'erpassed the cream of your champagne,
    When o'er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,
      That spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!
    Few things surpass old wine; and they may preach
      Who please,--the more because they preach in vain,--
    Let us have Wine and Woman, Mirth and Laughter,
    Sermons and soda-water the day after.

                      CLXXIX.

    Man, being reasonable, must get drunk;
      The best of Life is but intoxication:
    Glory, the Grape, Love, Gold, in these are sunk
      The hopes of all men, and of every nation;
    Without their sap, how branchless were the trunk
      Of Life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion!
    But to return,--Get very drunk, and when
    You wake with headache--you shall see what then!

                      CLXXX.

    Ring for your valet--bid him quickly bring
      Some hock and soda-water, then you'll know
    A pleasure worthy Xerxes the great king;
      For not the blest sherbet, sublimed with snow,
    Nor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,
      Nor Burgundy in all its sunset glow,
    After long travel, Ennui, Love, or Slaughter,
    Vie with that draught of hock and soda-water!

                      CLXXXI.

    The coast--I think it was the coast that I
      Was just describing--Yes, it was the coast--
    Lay at this period quiet as the sky,
      The sands untumbled, the blue waves untossed,
    And all was stillness, save the sea-bird's cry,
      And dolphin's leap, and little billow crossed
    By some low rock or shelve, that made it fret
    Against the boundary it scarcely wet.

                      CLXXXII.

    And forth they wandered, her sire being gone,
      As I have said, upon an expedition;
    And mother, brother, guardian, she had none,
      Save Zoe, who, although with due precision
    She waited on her lady with the Sun,
      Thought daily service was her only mission,
    Bringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,
    And asking now and then for cast-off dresses.

                      CLXXXIII.

    It was the cooling hour, just when the rounded
      Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,
    Which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,
      Circling all Nature, hushed, and dim, and still,
    With the far mountain-crescent half surrounded
      On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill
    Upon the other, and the rosy sky
    With one star sparkling through it like an eye.

                      CLXXXIV.

    And thus they wandered forth, and hand in hand,
      Over the shining pebbles and the shells,
    Glided along the smooth and hardened sand,
      And in the worn and wild receptacles
    Worked by the storms, yet worked as it were planned
      In hollow halls, with sparry roofs and cells,
    They turned to rest; and, each clasped by an arm,
    Yielded to the deep Twilight's purple charm.

                      CLXXXV.

    They looked up to the sky, whose floating glow
      Spread like a rosy Ocean, vast and bright;
    They gazed upon the glittering sea below,
      Whence the broad Moon rose circling into sight;
    They heard the waves' splash, and the wind so low,
      And saw each other's dark eyes darting light
    Into each other--and, beholding this,
    Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;

                      CLXXXVI.

    A long, long kiss, a kiss of Youth, and Love,
      And Beauty, all concentrating like rays
    Into one focus, kindled from above;
      Such kisses as belong to early days,
    Where Heart, and Soul, and Sense, in concert move,
      And the blood's lava, and the pulse a blaze,
    Each kiss a heart-quake,--for a kiss's strength,
    I think, it must be reckoned by its length.

                      CLXXXVII.

    By length I mean duration; theirs endured
      Heaven knows how long--no doubt they never reckoned;
    And if they had, they could not have secured
      The sum of their sensations to a second:
    They had not spoken, but they felt allured,
      As if their souls and lips each other beckoned,
    Which, being joined, like swarming bees they clung--
    Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.

                      CLXXXVIII.

    They were alone, but not alone as they
      Who shut in chambers think it loneliness;
    The silent Ocean, and the starlight bay,
      The twilight glow, which momently grew less,
    The voiceless sands, and dropping caves, that lay
      Around them, made them to each other press,
    As if there were no life beneath the sky
    Save theirs, and that their life could never die.

                      CLXXXIX.

    They feared no eyes nor ears on that lone beach;
      They felt no terrors from the night; they were
    All in all to each other: though their speech
      Was broken words, they thought a language there,--
    And all the burning tongues the Passions teach
      Found in one sigh the best interpreter
    Of Nature's oracle--first love,--that all
    Which Eve has left her daughters since her fall.

                      CXC.

    Haidee spoke not of scruples, asked no vows,
      Nor offered any; she had never heard
    Of plight and promises to be a spouse,
      Or perils by a loving maid incurred;
    She was all which pure Ignorance allows,
      And flew to her young mate like a young bird;
    And, never having dreamt of falsehood, she
    Had not one word to say of constancy.

                      CXCI.

    She loved, and was beloved--she adored,
      And she was worshipped after Nature's fashion--
    Their intense souls, into each other poured,
      If souls could die, had perished in that passion,--
    But by degrees their senses were restored,
      Again to be o'ercome, again to dash on;
    And, beating 'gainst his bosom, Haidee's heart
    Felt as if never more to beat apart.

                      CXCII.

    Alas! they were so young, so beautiful,
      So lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour
    Was that in which the Heart is always full,
      And, having o'er itself no further power,
    Prompts deeds Eternity can not annul,
      But pays off moments in an endless shower
    Of hell-fire--all prepared for people giving
    Pleasure or pain to one another living.

                      CXCIII.

    Alas! for Juan and Haidee! they were
      So loving and so lovely--till then never,
    Excepting our first parents, such a pair
      Had run the risk of being damned for ever:
    And Haidee, being devout as well as fair,
      Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,
    And Hell and Purgatory--but forgot
    Just in the very crisis she should not.

                      CXCIV.

    They look upon each other, and their eyes
      Gleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps
    Round Juan's head, and his around her lies
      Half buried in the tresses which it grasps;
    She sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,
      He hers, until they end in broken gasps;
    And thus they form a group that's quite antique,
    Half naked, loving, natural, and Greek.

                      CXCV.

    And when those deep and burning moments passed,
      And Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,
    She slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,
      Sustained his head upon her bosom's charms;
    And now and then her eye to Heaven is cast,
      And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,
    Pillowed on her o'erflowing heart, which pants
    With all it granted, and with all it grants.

                      CXCVI.

    An infant when it gazes on a light,
      A child the moment when it drains the breast,
    A devotee when soars the Host in sight,
      An Arab with a stranger for a guest,
    A sailor when the prize has struck in fight,
      A miser filling his most hoarded chest,
    Feel rapture; but not such true joy are reaping
    As they who watch o'er what they love while sleeping.

                      CXCVII.

    For there it lies so tranquil, so beloved,
      All that it hath of Life with us is living;
    So gentle, stirless, helpless, and unmoved,
      And all unconscious of the joy 't is giving;
    All it hath felt, inflicted, passed, and proved,
      Hushed into depths beyond the watcher's diving:
    There lies the thing we love with all its errors
    And all its charms, like Death without its terrors.

                      CXCVIII.

    The Lady watched her lover--and that hour
      Of Love's, and Night's, and Ocean's solitude
    O'erflowed her soul with their united power;
      Amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude
    She and her wave-worn love had made their bower,
      Where nought upon their passion could intrude,
    And all the stars that crowded the blue space
    Saw nothing happier than her glowing face.

                      CXCIX.

    Alas! the love of Women! it is known
      To be a lovely and a fearful thing;
    For all of theirs upon that die is thrown,
      And if 't is lost, Life hath no more to bring
    To them but mockeries of the past alone,
      And their revenge is as the tiger's spring,
    Deadly, and quick, and crushing; yet, as real
    Torture is theirs--what they inflict they feel.

                      CC.

    They are right; for Man, to man so oft unjust,
      Is always so to Women: one sole bond
    Awaits them--treachery is all their trust;
      Taught to conceal their bursting hearts despond
    Over their idol, till some wealthier lust
      Buys them in marriage--and what rests beyond?
    A thankless husband--next, a faithless lover--
    Then dressing, nursing, praying--and all's over.

                      CCI.

    Some take a lover, some take drams or prayers,
      Some mind their household, others dissipation,
    Some run away, and but exchange their cares,
      Losing the advantage of a virtuous station;
    Few changes e'er can better their affairs,
      Theirs being an unnatural situation,
    From the dull palace to the dirty hovel:
    Some play the devil, and then write a novel.

                      CCII.

    Haidee was Nature's bride, and knew not this;
      Haidee was Passion's child, born where the Sun
    Showers triple light, and scorches even the kiss
      Of his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one
    Made but to love, to feel that she was his
      Who was her chosen: what was said or done
    Elsewhere was nothing. She had nought to fear,
    Hope, care, nor love, beyond,--her heart beat here.

                      CCIII.

    And oh! that quickening of the heart, that beat!
      How much it costs us! yet each rising throb
    Is in its cause as its effect so sweet,
      That Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob
    Joy of its alchemy, and to repeat
      Fine truths; even Conscience, too, has a tough job
    To make us understand each good old maxim,
    So good--I wonder Castlereagh don't tax 'em.

                      CCIV.

    And now 't was done--on the lone shore were plighted
      Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed
    Beauty upon the beautiful they lighted:
      Ocean their witness, and the cave their bed,
    By their own feelings hallowed and united,
      Their priest was Solitude, and they were wed:
    And they were happy--for to their young eyes
    Each was an angel, and earth Paradise.

                      CCV.

    Oh, Love! of whom great Caesar was the suitor,
      Titus the master, Antony the slave,
    Horace, Catullus, scholars--Ovid tutor--
      Sappho the sage blue-stocking, in whose grave
    All those may leap who rather would be neuter--
      (Leucadia's rock still overlooks the wave)--
    Oh, Love! thou art the very God of evil,
    For, after all, we cannot call thee Devil.

                      CCVI.

    Thou mak'st the chaste connubial state precarious,
      And jestest with the brows of mightiest men:
    Caesar and Pompey, Mahomet, Belisarius,
      Have much employed the Muse of History's pen:
    Their lives and fortunes were extremely various,
      Such worthies Time will never see again;
    Yet to these four in three things the same luck holds,
    They all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.

                      CCVII.

    Thou mak'st philosophers; there's Epicurus
      And Aristippus, a material crew!
    Who to immoral courses would allure us
      By theories quite practicable too;
    If only from the Devil they would insure us,
      How pleasant were the maxim (not quite new),
    "Eat, drink, and love, what can the rest avail us?"
    So said the royal sage Sardanapalus.

                      CCVIII.

    But Juan! had he quite forgotten Julia?
      And should he have forgotten her so soon?
    I can't but say it seems to me most truly a
      Perplexing question; but, no doubt, the moon
    Does these things for us, and whenever newly a
      Strong palpitation rises, 't is her boon,
    Else how the devil is it that fresh features
    Have such a charm for us poor human creatures?

                      CCIX.

    I hate inconstancy--I loathe, detest,
      Abhor, condemn, abjure the mortal made
    Of such quicksilver clay that in his breast
      No permanent foundation can be laid;
    Love, constant love, has been my constant guest,
      And yet last night, being at a masquerade,
    I saw the prettiest creature, fresh from Milan,
    Which gave me some sensations like a villain.

                      CCX.

    But soon Philosophy came to my aid,
      And whispered, "Think of every sacred tie!"
    "I will, my dear Philosophy!" I said,
      "But then her teeth, and then, oh, Heaven! her eye!
    I'll just inquire if she be wife or maid,
      Or neither--out of curiosity."
    "Stop!" cried Philosophy, with air so Grecian,
    (Though she was masqued then as a fair Venetian;)

                      CCXI.

    "Stop!" so I stopped.--But to return: that which
      Men call inconstancy is nothing more
    Than admiration due where Nature's rich
      Profusion with young beauty covers o'er
    Some favoured object; and as in the niche
      A lovely statue we almost adore,
    This sort of adoration of the real
    Is but a heightening of the beau ideal.

                      CCXII.

    'T is the perception of the Beautiful,
      A fine extension of the faculties,
    Platonic, universal, wonderful,
      Drawn from the stars, and filtered through the skies,
    Without which Life would be extremely dull;
      In short, it is the use of our own eyes,
    With one or two small senses added, just
    To hint that flesh is formed of fiery dust.

                      CCXIII.

    Yet 't is a painful feeling, and unwilling,
      For surely if we always could perceive
    In the same object graces quite as killing
      As when she rose upon us like an Eve,
    'T would save us many a heartache, many a shilling,
      (For we must get them anyhow, or grieve),
    Whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,
    How pleasant for the heart, as well as liver!

                      CCXIV.

    The Heart is like the sky, a part of Heaven,
      But changes night and day, too, like the sky;
    Now o'er it clouds and thunder must be driven,
      And Darkness and Destruction as on high:
    But when it hath been scorched, and pierced, and riven,
      Its storms expire in water-drops; the eye
    Pours forth at last the Heart's blood turned to tears,
    Which make the English climate of our years.

                      CCXV.

    The liver is the lazaret of bile,
      But very rarely executes its function,
    For the first passion stays there such a while,
      That all the rest creep in and form a junction,
    Like knots of vipers on a dunghill's soil--
      Rage, fear, hate, jealousy, revenge, compunction--
    So that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,
    Like Earthquakes from the hidden fire called "central."

                      CCXVI.

    In the mean time, without proceeding more
      In this anatomy, I've finished now
    Two hundred and odd stanzas as before,
      That being about the number I'll allow
    Each canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;
      And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,
    Leaving Don Juan and Haidee to plead
    For them and theirs with all who deign to read.

             CANTO THE THIRD.

                      I.

    HAIL, Muse! et cetera.--We left Juan sleeping,
      Pillowed upon a fair and happy breast,
    And watched by eyes that never yet knew weeping,
      And loved by a young heart, too deeply blest
    To feel the poison through her spirit creeping,
      Or know who rested there, a foe to rest,
    Had soiled the current of her sinless years,
    And turned her pure heart's purest blood to tears!

                      II.

    Oh, Love! what is it in this world of ours
      Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah why
    With cypress branches hast thou wreathed thy bowers,
      And made thy best interpreter a sigh?
    As those who dote on odours pluck the flowers,
      And place them on their breast--but place to die--
    Thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish
    Are laid within our bosoms but to perish.

                      III.

    In her first passion Woman loves her lover,
      In all the others all she loves is Love,
    Which grows a habit she can ne'er get over,
      And fits her loosely--like an easy glove,
    As you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:
      One man alone at first her heart can move;
    She then prefers him in the plural number,
    Not finding that the additions much encumber.

                      IV.

    I know not if the fault be men's or theirs;
      But one thing's pretty sure; a woman planted
    (Unless at once she plunge for life in prayers)--
      After a decent time must be gallanted;
    Although, no doubt, her first of love affairs
      Is that to which her heart is wholly granted;
    Yet there are some, they say, who have had none,
    But those who have ne'er end with only one.

                      V.

    'T is melancholy, and a fearful sign
      Of human frailty, folly, also crime,
    That Love and Marriage rarely can combine,
      Although they both are born in the same clime;
    Marriage from Love, like vinegar from wine--
      A sad, sour, sober beverage--by Time
    Is sharpened from its high celestial flavour
    Down to a very homely household savour.

                      VI.

    There's something of antipathy, as 't were,
      Between their present and their future state;
    A kind of flattery that's hardly fair
      Is used until the truth arrives too late--
    Yet what can people do, except despair?
      The same things change their names at such a rate;
    For instance--Passion in a lover's glorious,
    But in a husband is pronounced uxorious.

                      VII.

    Men grow ashamed of being so very fond;
      They sometimes also get a little tired
    (But that, of course, is rare), and then despond:
      The same things cannot always be admired,
    Yet 't is "so nominated in the bond,"
      That both are tied till one shall have expired.
    Sad thought! to lose the spouse that was adorning
    Our days, and put one's servants into mourning.

                      VIII.

    There's doubtless something in domestic doings
      Which forms, in fact, true Love's antithesis;
    Romances paint at full length people's wooings,
      But only give a bust of marriages;
    For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,
      There's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:
    Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,
    He would have written sonnets all his life?

                      IX.

    All tragedies are finished by a death,
      All comedies are ended by a marriage;
    The future states of both are left to faith,
      For authors fear description might disparage
    The worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,
      And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;
    So leaving each their priest and prayer-book ready,
    They say no more of Death or of the Lady.

                      X.

    The only two that in my recollection,
      Have sung of Heaven and Hell, or marriage, are
    Dante and Milton, and of both the affection
      Was hapless in their nuptials, for some bar
    Of fault or temper ruined the connection
      (Such things, in fact, it don't ask much to mar);
    But Dante's Beatrice and Milton's Eve
    Were not drawn from their spouses, you conceive.

                      XI.

    Some persons say that Dante meant Theology
      By Beatrice, and not a mistress--I,
    Although my opinion may require apology,
      Deem this a commentator's phantasy,
    Unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he
      Decided thus, and showed good reason why;
    I think that Dante's more abstruse ecstatics
    Meant to personify the Mathematics.

                      XII.

    Haidee and Juan were not married, but
      The fault was theirs, not mine: it is not fair,
    Chaste reader, then, in any way to put
      The blame on me, unless you wish they were;
    Then if you'd have them wedded, please to shut
      The book which treats of this erroneous pair,
    Before the consequences grow too awful;
    'T is dangerous to read of loves unlawful.

                      XIII.

    Yet they were happy,--happy in the illicit
      Indulgence of their innocent desires;
    But more imprudent grown with every visit,
      Haidee forgot the island was her Sire's;
    When we have what we like 't is hard to miss it,
      At least in the beginning, ere one tires;
    Thus she came often, not a moment losing,
    Whilst her piratical papa was cruising.

                      XIV.

    Let not his mode of raising cash seem strange,
      Although he fleeced the flags of every nation,
    For into a Prime Minister but change
      His title, and 't is nothing but taxation;
    But he, more modest, took an humbler range
      Of Life, and in an honester vocation
    Pursued o'er the high seas his watery journey,
    And merely practised as a sea-attorney.

                      XV.

    The good old gentleman had been detained
      By winds and waves, and some important captures;
    And, in the hope of more, at sea remained,
      Although a squall or two had damped his raptures,
    By swamping one of the prizes; he had chained
      His prisoners, dividing them like chapters
    In numbered lots; they all had cuffs and collars,
    And averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars.

                      XVI.

    Some he disposed of off Cape Matapan,
      Among his friends the Mainots; some he sold
    To his Tunis correspondents, save one man
      Tossed overboard unsaleable (being old);
    The rest--save here and there some richer one,
      Reserved for future ransom--in the hold,
    Were linked alike, as, for the common people, he
    Had a large order from the Dey of Tripoli.

                      XVII.

    The merchandise was served in the same way,
      Pieced out for different marts in the Levant,
    Except some certain portions of the prey,
      Light classic articles of female want,
    French stuffs, lace, tweezers, toothpicks, teapot, tray,
      Guitars and castanets from Alicant,
    All which selected from the spoil he gathers,
    Robbed for his daughter by the best of fathers.

                      XVIII.

    A monkey, a Dutch mastiff, a mackaw,
      Two parrots, with a Persian cat and kittens,
    He chose from several animals he saw--
      A terrier, too, which once had been a Briton's,
    Who dying on the coast of Ithaca,
      The peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance:
    These to secure in this strong blowing weather,
    He caged in one huge hamper altogether.

                      XIX.

    Then, having settled his marine affairs,
      Despatching single cruisers here and there,
    His vessel having need of some repairs,
      He shaped his course to where his daughter fair
    Continued still her hospitable cares;
      But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,
    And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,
    His port lay on the other side o' the isle.

                      XX.

    And there he went ashore without delay,
      Having no custom-house nor quarantine
    To ask him awkward questions on the way,
      About the time and place where he had been:
    He left his ship to be hove down next day,
      With orders to the people to careen;
    So that all hands were busy beyond measure,
    In getting out goods, ballast, guns, and treasure.

                      XXI.

    Arriving at the summit of a hill
      Which overlooked the white walls of his home,
    He stopped.--What singular emotions fill
      Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!
    With fluttering doubts if all be well or ill--
      With love for many, and with fears for some;
    All feelings which o'erleap the years long lost,
    And bring our hearts back to their starting-post.

                      XXII.

    The approach of home to husbands and to sires,
      After long travelling by land or water,
    Most naturally some small doubt inspires--
      A female family's a serious matter,
    (None trusts the sex more, or so much admires--
      But they hate flattery, so I never flatter);
    Wives in their husbands' absences grow subtler,
    And daughters sometimes run off with the butler.

                      XXIII.

    An honest gentleman at his return
      May not have the good fortune of Ulysses;
    Not all lone matrons for their husbands mourn,
      Or show the same dislike to suitors' kisses;
    The odds are that he finds a handsome urn
      To his memory--and two or three young misses
    Born to some friend, who holds his wife and riches--
    And that his Argus--bites him by the breeches.

                      XXIV.

    If single, probably his plighted Fair
      Has in his absence wedded some rich miser;
    But all the better, for the happy pair
      May quarrel, and, the lady growing wiser,
    He may resume his amatory care
      As cavalier servente, or despise her;
    And that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,
    Writes odes on the Inconstancy of Woman.

                      XXV.

    And oh! ye gentlemen who have already
      Some chaste liaison of the kind--I mean
    An honest friendship with a married lady--
      The only thing of this sort ever seen
    To last--of all connections the most steady,
      And the true Hymen, (the first's but a screen)--
    Yet, for all that, keep not too long away--
    I've known the absent wronged four times a day.

                      XXVI.

    Lambro, our sea-solicitor, who had
      Much less experience of dry land than Ocean,
    On seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;
      But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion
    Of the true reason of his not being sad,
      Or that of any other strong emotion;
    He loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,
    But knew the cause no more than a philosopher.

                      XXVII.

    He saw his white walls shining in the sun,
      His garden trees all shadowy and green;
    He heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,
      The distant dog-bark; and perceived between
    The umbrage of the wood, so cool and dun,
      The moving figures, and the sparkling sheen
    Of arms (in the East all arm)--and various dyes
    Of coloured garbs, as bright as butterflies.

                      XXVIII.

    And as the spot where they appear he nears,
      Surprised at these unwonted signs of idling,
    He hears--alas! no music of the spheres,
      But an unhallowed, earthly sound of fiddling!
    A melody which made him doubt his ears,
      The cause being past his guessing or unriddling;
    A pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after--
    A most unoriental roar of laughter.

                      XXIX.

    And still more nearly to the place advancing,
      Descending rather quickly the declivity,
    Through the waved branches o'er the greensward glancing,
      'Midst other indications of festivity,
    Seeing a troop of his domestics dancing
      Like Dervises, who turn as on a pivot, he
    Perceived it was the Pyrrhic dance so martial,
    To which the Levantines are very partial.

                      XXX.

    And further on a troop of Grecian girls,
      The first and tallest her white kerchief waving,
    Were strung together like a row of pearls,
      Linked hand in hand, and dancing; each too having
    Down her white neck long floating auburn curls--
      (The least of which would set ten poets raving);
    Their leader sang--and bounded to her song
    With choral step and voice the virgin throng.

                      XXXI.

    And here, assembled cross-legged round their trays,
      Small social parties just begun to dine;
    Pilaus and meats of all sorts met the gaze,
      And flasks of Samian and of Chian wine,
    And sherbet cooling in the porous vase;
      Above them their dessert grew on its vine;--
    The orange and pomegranate nodding o'er,
    Dropped in their laps, scarce plucked, their mellow store.

                      XXXII.

    A band of children, round a snow-white ram,
      There wreathe his venerable horns with flowers;
    While peaceful as if still an unweaned lamb,
      The patriarch of the flock all gently cowers
    His sober head, majestically tame,
      Or eats from out the palm, or playful lowers
    His brow, as if in act to butt, and then
    Yielding to their small hands, draws back again.
